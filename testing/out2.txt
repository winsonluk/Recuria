To do that, Ammar and co-founder Talis Ammar developed a technology platform that allows children to learn through play. The platform is designed to help children develop language, communication, and social skills, and ultimately help them find jobs and stay in school.
“We believe that kids are not going to school,” Ammar said. “The current educational system is completely insane. We have no idea what our kids are going to do. They’re not going to school, they’re not going to the school.

In the age of the social media generation, it’s easy to forget that not all kids want to connect with their friends on Facebook. In fact, research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry revealed that not only do we know, but that many of the most promising early behavioral therapies for children are based on the “good” ideas about what parents should be doing with their children, but not the reality.

That’s why many of today’s social media products, like Facebook, are built for the generation with little or no social skills. The idea is that we should use these products to help them get better and more engaged, but the reality is that many of today’s kids don’t have the skill to use them.

“As a society, we have become very desensitized, and I think that there’s a huge opportunity to help children, especially in the youngest generation, who are going to be exposed to technology and learning and will be able to have the most effective experiences,” adds Fishel.
“We are also seeing a huge gap in the way that children are being educated about technology and digital technologies. Today, there are still many schools that focus on the digital side, and that’s where we want to head in.”
The startup’s educational content is free for students to download and use, and it monetizes through its “Creative Commons” license. The company is currently working on bringing that content to schools and is planning to launch an open beta version of its “digital classroom” later this year.

“The biggest challenge for kids is to learn language at a age that is as early as possible,” said Pavan Tapadia, who teaches English at Hyderabad High School and is also an associate at Caufield Bypass. “It’s a huge problem, but it’s one that we are trying to solve through Dots.”
“The way we see it, kids are getting ready to learn English at a younger age, and they are getting good at reading and writing,” added Kaurav Garg, who is Dots’ lead developer.
Dots was incubated at Cramster, an early-stage fund in Hyderabad, and is currently participating in the Microsoft Accelerator for the duration of its program.

Dotino is helping children overcome cultural disability. The idea is that kids who experience disability have a natural inclination to get help from others, which can make it difficult for them to get well. Dotino helps kids with their disabilities through a game that helps them develop a independence.
“When we think about disability, we think about it as a symptom,” co-founder and CEO Gautam Parthasarathy told me. “But we shouldn’t think about it as a consequence. It’s a lifestyle.”
Parthasarathy added that kids don’t think about how they will get disability. They think about it as a lifestyle. So if you think about obesity, that’s the root of the problem. You don’t think about how you will get healthy.
“You have to break out of the siloed thinking that’s

“I’ve always had the problem of learning in a new language,” says Parthasarathy, who is also a child psychologist. “My mom was diagnosed with autism when I was in the third grade. I was very concerned about the impact on her and the impact on her life.”
After spending several years in academic research at Stanford, Parthasarathy realized that the problem of learning English in India is very widespread.

For students who are affected by reading difficulties, getting assigned to reading materials is not enough. Many of the children are asked to do everything from scratch to find out new names. They have to work through problems like “Why is this in black?” to understand who it is they are talking to.
“The non-English content has already been replaced by very effective English content,” Cartagena said. “Parents know the importance of that content.”
The school says it is open to more submissions from developers and organizations that will help with the development of technology that help students.

It uses software to connect kids to real world cartoons and cartoon-like characters. When a child makes a choice, they know they’re going to get someone special. They’re likely to say, “Aww, they did that. Wait, are you asking me to build a damn device?” Or maybe, “No, let’s do it now. When I was small, I saw people taking videos of their pet” or “You’re the new Papar!” These are all real choices.

Born without the misfortune of being addressed, without the proper education, and having a strong disability, my family was constantly in need of my safety. I was lucky enough to go to college and learn design and 3D at an early age. After attending my andora degree at Harvard and learning English, one of the greatest hardships of disability came to my sister. She knew what I wanted to do for disability and encouraged me to learn about it. It took about three months for us to go to our pediatrician. At this point, she was concerned about whether I would be too difficult and would blow up at school. At that time, I made fake braces and spoke badly of my mouthpiece in front of my classmates.
