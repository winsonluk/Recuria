Dotino is a SaaS Project Management Software Compiler. Designed to replace OpenIDS, Proximus and Xeped, Dotino lets IT control the way applications are distributed and secured. In other words, it lets IT know how an application is distributed, secured and isolated.
To use Dotino, IT can walk through an example of a user downloading a package. After entering a complete description of the software package, a security policy definition can be created and configured. For example, an administrator could tell an application to do the right thing at certain times, or issue it with an unauthorized device to any unsecured devices at all.
To get started, an administrator initiates the interaction with the content, downloads the resulting file, and uses it to secure the system.
Then, the admin can see where the data and policies live. He or she can monitor source, destination and author and set policies on a granular level.

Dotino is a cloud-based software development tool for application developers. The company provides a software development kit (SDK) that enables software developers to write code once and publish it as a native SDK for Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and the Web.
“We are helping software developers build scalable applications. The real differentiation is in the capabilities of the SDK,” says founder and CEO Patrick Bach. “It’s a software development kit, but it’s also a complete application development platform.”
The SDK enables developers to create an app that can be tested in multiple environments, such as real world testing. It also allows them to publish their app with multiple authorings, and data about app performance and usage.
Bach says that the real value of Dotino is in the capabilities it provides developers.

The idea is to help companies build applications that can be tested and deployed in the cloud with minimal effort. It does this by offering a single API-based API for creating, publishing, and managing mobile, web, and desktop apps.
“We believe that the future of app development is not based on client-server technology,” says co-founder and CEO, Terence Wang, “but rather, the application’s API is the key to its success.”
To help it develop, Dotino is currently in private beta. It will be available to all today.
Wang says Dotino can help companies build apps that are both “microservices” and “applications,” with the former referring to the microservices in application development and the latter as applications.
