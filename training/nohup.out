======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 on at the time of the purchase by Facebook, which makes this option especially attractive:

The only downsides of this solution are the length of the waiting time from arrival to use, and the expense. Both of these factors are not new issues for Facebook at this point, but it is nice to have a way to avoid these kinds of conflicts as well as give Facebook the ability to add new users and change the rules on them with little notification.
The solution above will give Facebook more flexibility with managing user profiles, but I think some users are going to find it even harder to deal with this type of setup. For some people, this might feel like a huge hurdle, but for others, it could just be a way to add users to a friend list without having to dig through their contacts."
"It looks like WhatsApp is going to get a major overhaul as an SMS-replacement app, just in time for Black Friday, and it sounds a little familiar. Although many people are already using WhatsApp for texting purposes, the idea is to offer more functionality and customization.
With this app, called Whatspot, WhatsApp is trying to move past its origins in text, adding many features to make it an SMS-replacement more than a one-stop-shop.
The product, which launched a little under a week ago, looks like a fairly straightforward SMS replacement app, with Facebook integration as well as the ability to chat privately and with your contacts.
I was first briefed on the product some two weeks ago, when the first official beta began. At the time, it was still in beta, so I had to go back and re-test in order to determine whether it worked.
One of the main complaints people have been having with WhatsApp for a while is the awkwardness when sending text messages to contacts on a phone, instead just sending them a link to a webpage.
The other issue is that WhatsApp, if it ever got serious about SMS-replacement, would be really complex to use and would have to be used in a very specific way, even more than just in a text mode. In other words, Facebook would be the main means of communication — and in order to send messages from Facebook to WhatsApp, you need to have both the app and the browser loaded on each device.
The new app looks like a very welcome step in that direction. The new app is really a simplified SMS replacement, without all of the bells and whistles. And, like other SMS replacements, it will remarkablely let you use WhatsApp to do more than just text in a browser browser, making it a much sleeker alternative to WhatsApp, which at its current state’s has some of the more painful convergence scapes of the lot – in particular, when you consider that it’s been months since the launch, Facebook’s native application will still have the same interface and features as a SMS-replacement.
The new Whatspot app works in a similar way to other SMS-replacement products like the Android-exclusive Whatsmo’s, including the ability to send photos, video, and voice messages to people you don’t know and sending those messages by just pressing a button.
All of these are features that have been a standard over the years in the SMS-replacement space, but WhatsApp wants to change it – and I can say this because it is the platform it’s built on.
I have not used the app myself yet, and thus don’t have any real experience with things like authentication, but it’s a huge improvement indeed. (And I suspect Facebook will continue investigating other ways to leverage WhatsApp to do some of this stuff, like with its WhatsApp Sync app.) The new Whatspot application also lets you customize and fine-tune the layout of your WhatsApp messages, a new feature that could help improve the messaging experience through a better way of adding icons, tabs, and other content to your messages.
“We’re doing the best we can to offer those features, the way Facebook was doing them, and what the Google and other social platforms were doing. But it’s the right stuff,” WhatsApp said in a statement today.
Facebook has already shown that it wants to leverage WhatsApp in this fashion in other ways, like by allowing WhatsApp Sync, which helps WhatsApp sync with Facebook and Facebook sync with Google Sync as well as Twitter, Microsoft, Instagram and Microsoft’s “Sky’, among others.
While Facebook’s other Messenger integration options can still work within WhatsApp itself, the new app makes sense because it’s the best solution WhatsApp has found so far out. And it’s certainly a lot more straightforward in practice than a combination of Whatsmo’s, Google’s Messenger and Skype, or the other social communications platforms I’

 makes up 70 percent of the app. If an app like the Google Maps, or mapping apps that rely on location like Tile Maps, are used to show you locations closer or further, less expensive maps will pay off—the maps will be far less expensive than maps without location, where more expensive maps are better suited to a more complex map. Maps with location and map features alone may end up costing more than maps without locations, especially in the mapping apps.
“Maps with map data and maps without map data are not as expensive,” he said. “But maps with maps are incredibly expensive, and maps without maps are the cheapest,” he said.
For now, the new maps from Mapquest, which Mapquest is launching today, are free on the platform. Mapquest is making maps as ubiquitous as maps before. Maps are one of the most widely used applications on mobile, and they are growing more commonplace, as the Apple Maps app continues to gain mainstream adoption."
"Apple has officially unveiled its first big map-based app store in the App Store. Now, the company is taking the mapping scene and mapping business over on Android. Mapquest announced last week that mapping is now officially in its “Maps for Maps” app on Google Play and on Android devices.
The maps were designed in cooperation with Mapquest’s mapping provider Mapquest Maps.com, which makes mapping very popular today. But Mapquest Maps is not one of Mapquest Maps' largest mapping companies, Mapquest Maps only accounts for about 5 percent of Mapquest Maps.com’s business, and Mapquest Maps is focused on maps and maps for maps. Maps for Maps is a very basic mapping product, and Mapquest Maps has yet to hit the top charts of the Mapquest maps app. Mapquest Maps has been around since 1996, but Mapquest Maps only made its debut with Mapquest Maps Maps, that released in 1998. It was an app with a map, but that map was in the Mapquest Maps website.
The maps themselves have a very simple grid and have a lot more detail than maps for maps made for Mapquest Maps.com, which are simply labeled maps, or Mapquest Maps for Maps. Maps for Maps, and Maps for Maps without Mapquest Maps are almost identical in almost every way, except in the name. Maps for Maps with Mapquest Maps, Maps for Maps without Mapquest Maps, Mapquest Maps for Maps, Mapquest Maps for Maps (with Maps for Maps), and maps in Maps for Maps with Maps. It’s the same maps that Mapquest Maps made for maps before they folded. Maps for Maps didn’t grow at all. Mapquest Maps just continued to do maps for maps.
Mapquest Mapquest Maps, the mapping company that designed Maps for Maps, and the maps it produced for maps and maps, are very well executed maps.
And Mapquest Maps is not the only map maker to have maps as their main mobile apps. MapQuest Maps has maps for maps and maps for maps, maps for maps and maps, maps for maps and maps, maps for maps and maps, maps for maps (with maps), maps for maps and maps (with maps), maps for maps and maps (with maps), maps for maps and maps (with maps), maps for maps and maps (with maps), maps for maps and maps, maps for maps and maps, maps for maps, maps for maps and maps, maps for maps (with maps), maps for maps and maps (with Maps) and maps for maps with Maps. I’ve seen maps for maps and maps in MapQuest Maps on Google Play, Mapquest Maps on Pinterest, and Mapquest Maps on Pinterest. Maps for Maps has Maps for Maps, Maps for Maps with Maps, Maps for Maps and Maps for Maps. Maps for Maps is MapQuest Maps’ business, Mapquest Maps Maps’ business, and Maps for Maps is Mapquest Maps’ business. Mapquest Maps has maps in Maps for Maps/Maps for Maps, Maps for Maps with Maps and Maps for Maps. Maps for Maps with Maps/Maps for Maps is MapQuest Maps’ business, Maps for Maps with Maps and Maps for Maps. Maps for maps with Maps is MapQuest Maps’ business, and Maps for Maps is Mapquest Maps’ business. Maps for Maps with maps is Maps for Maps, Maps for Maps with Maps, Maps with Maps, maps with Maps, Maps with Maps, Maps with Maps, Maps with Maps, Maps with Maps, maps for Maps, Maps for Maps.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 an is that the company’s new iOS app has a little more than 50 million active users -- the app has become the most popular in the mobile social networking area, but only after a couple of weeks, the company has seen over 10.5 million unique user sessions in a month, an interesting result for the startup.

The data gathered by this new iOS App Store data tracking also backs up the numbers from its new Facebook page, where more than 1 million unique users were tracked each day -- there appear to be plenty of other mobile social networking apps out there.
It’s also interesting that only two weeks ago, the company shared a report of Facebook pages being used to target people in the U.S., but not having this handy iOS API to track usage suggests that maybe it’s time for a few more, and maybe a few more. Still, we’ve seen an app that can track usage of other apps in the iOS App Store already. If it can achieve that, it might be time to consider giving the app a try."
"In short, you can find any person online. Just like everyone else, you either find them or you don’t.
But like all things in the social networking game, the discovery process is incredibly easy. Just follow your friend online, then it will show you what you are looking for. Sometimes it doesn’t work…and not in the way you want, but hey, I don’t care. (In fact, I prefer it.)
You can always open a profile in the App Store to see everyone’s activity, which helps you get a sense of who you are actually trying to connect.
For people who like playing around with the App Store discovery options, this is the perfect place to do it.
For those who prefer to find things directly, this makes the search a little more difficult. Here are a few sites and apps that track users across multiple social networks:
And don’t forget about the other social networking options:

Of course, most of these social networking apps don’t offer the feature the App Store does, but they are helpful nonetheless, and it’s better to be getting more social and active than a little inactive. I personally recommend some. One thing to remember is that Facebook does a very good job of not letting apps use your profile, but even that doesn’t mean you can stay active.
To find other people who are active, just copy their profile URL or create a fake profile that you can use as an indication that your profile is legit. Just follow the other links to your profile to see the names of who you may have copied.
This process can be done directly in the App Store, or via the network.
One thing you can check out from these websites and apps is that there are plenty of other apps in the iOS App Store, so that makes them even easier. For those who prefer doing it this way, there are some other things to consider:
For example, I’d often ask users on Pinterest to fill out their profile, while Google+’s APIs might be very limited on how much information can be tracked.
I used to have a friend who had a Facebook profile, but I couldn’t find her Facebook page. On the other hand, I have a friend who had two Facebook profiles: one in order to get a social networking app and another in order to use the Google Social Networking App.
You can always follow one page or Google+ page and see what the others are saying. The next time you ask someone about their Facebook profile, you’ll get a confirmation of their activity. This will always make you more skeptical, but you’re still not completely sure yet that this is all there is.
On Facebook, you could go to the News Feed and find what they are doing.
To find something new, you could click or tap the profile of your Google+ page’s URL, or look at all of Google’s pages on the screen.
Then check the App Store to see what the app actually offers. Facebook and Twitter are the most obvious choices, and Google Web Search shows you a lot.
So, as long as you are not using your Facebook profile, I would recommend these networks.
And if you have any questions, just ask. I’ll also add comments below, since it’s a good way to start conversations."

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 their-sharing site and disaster-area relief project, it’s been working on its technology to provide something of a hybrid between Facebook and social discovery in a much more elegant way.
When I first heard that social sharing in a disaster is as hard to come by as it is to be alive, I was skeptical — and the fact that social sharing is an area of growth for all these companies, not just Facebook, proves that to me. But how is it all going to work anyway?
In an interview with TechCrunch, CEO Eduardo Saverin said he feels there’s a need in our disaster recovery situation and the responsibility of social sharing there."
"I’m a huge fan of Facebook’s News Feed for giving anyone a way to get news, but on the other hand, I know that I might have a little difficulty. A quick Google search for what’s trending on Facebook can make it seem like there’s no news in my town right now; I want to do a little research. Facebook News Feed looks to be the answer. The company says it’s getting its “people’s’ interest” through the “personalization of a News Feed to bring it home,” while the new app offers a “simple way to add content to people’s News Feed.”
The news feed is a small place and you can only see the latest trending news that people want, not people who want to add the latest content – but since you can only have 1 News Feed, you start with that.
As an aside, the News Feed is completely free, though Google doesn’t really sell the News Feed feature at $1.99 or $5.99, and it’s free for the first month.
News Feed will be launching a “Live News Feed” in the first few weeks of September, a feature which will be a little different from Facebook Live Video.
Facebook has been rolling down a fairly simple news feed formula, using News Feed to help drive new content to the News Feed. However, it’s still too complex for most users.
The new News Feed is based off that original news feed formula, but with a couple of additions.
The main newsfeed will provide direct links to people’s News Feed, and there’s also an option to post content directly from News Feed. Users will be able to add their own feed, but the content will be curated and shared by default.
What’s new is a new way to view Stories from News Feed with the new “Feeding” method, which allows users to see where a Story has been pinned and how many Stories are currently being published.
The addition is another example of how a simple, direct approach like the one Facebook launched in February was a bit of a gamble. The initial focus was on building tools to help news feeders who were too busy adding Stories to their News Feed and still having difficulty sharing content, to find things to update, while Facebook launched the Search News Feed and the “Featured Stories” and then launched the Conting Today section, which tried to offer a simpler, search-focused News Feed.
It wasn’t just about how to add and view Stories. The company also experimented with other suggestions, including sharing stories to your Facebook News Feed but the results were less-than-enthusiast, with even less of an impact on traffic.
“In some ways, Facebook did the same thing as News Feeds,” said co-founder and CEO Andrew McQuarn. “We would see that people are linking to Story after Story, and people link to Stories they have to do some research on. But it’s still difficult to find that story to add. Now we have a more direct way of doing that.”
McQuarn added that while it was a bit of an experiment, it could be potentially useful to the News Feed community.
“The first thing is I think it’s a little hard to see where the results will be,” he added. “People would love it as they used to view Stories, but I think they can take to the first few times and start being a little more direct.”
Facebook does have its own way to get Stories to the News Feed. You just don’t have to share your content in order to get your Stories added to your News Feed, and then add them to your News Feed as a means of getting news into your news feed.
McQuarn added that there will be no ads or analytics, with only free traffic. The only feature of interest will be ads designed to give you an extra, though, he said.
And with its focus on personalization, the News Feed wants users to get personalized views to make it

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 on the web when it launched back in May.
SMSCatch has released this one of its projects under the umbrella of the Google Project S. If you have ever had an SMS or data capture feature, then you probably appreciate them.
The first feature was just for Facebook for iOS in 2007, the second was a few months later.
The project is called SMSCatch and is the idea to make the SMS and CRM features in your mobile apps a more central point of integration. You can even tell your mobile apps that you’re listening to voicemail, a feature that was once offered only for voicemail apps but became available on iOS.
To start with the SMS component, the SMSCatch app has taken care of its own, standalone features. You can connect your Android or Windows device, or switch to your mobile phone without an account. The app lets you receive SMS messages using the SIM on your device.
And while you can find these features in more places, this is one of the few examples that demonstrates how they can be integrated. These features don’t replace the SMSCatch SMS application, just make it easier to get on board.
“Our goal is to find the perfect balance between getting a proper user experience and integrating the features that can help improve the usability and power of the apps,” says Shayna Barzalari, co-founder for the Facebook iOS and Android SVP. “What we’re doing is creating an SMS and CRM solution for a mobile developer or the end user who wants to send an SMS with all the features and information from SMS.”
When you first launch the app, you’ll see everything that’s part of SMS, such as the SMSCatch SMS app. This includes the contacts of your contacts, email accounts, SMS messages, calendar integrations, and the ability to send SMSs via location.
There are more SMS components here, but what makes this one of the better ones is that it’s not just a SMS component, but it’s also a CRM component as well. If you’re in the center of the SMS screen with the SMSCatch app on your head, you can tap to send a SMS. This is the same concept that was used in WhatsApp, the email product of WhatsApp, but the SMSCatch app adds an additional layer of authentication and data security. This means that when it asks for the SMS account, it has something else on its side to tell it where they’re from. Barzalari points out that it’s just one part of a whole-of-person, data security feature that makes sense for a mobile app.
The app itself has a number of features, too. It lets you send a SMS message, browse SMS/CRM/CMDM information, and manage your inbox. There are lots of customization options, though, which means if you feel like there’s something not quite right with what you’re doing, you can go to the app and tap to see what else you’re missing, a feature that was included for example in the recent launch of a new, native messaging app, WhatsApp.
The SMS feature is a free download for $6 a month in iOS. (The app was free for iOS during the beta period between March 23 to April 6, but its pricing has since changed to $10 a month in exchange for a new ID and password.) It’s designed to be a place to create and send SMS text messages that go straight to your iPhone’s contacts. You see friends, the phone numbers and text of people you’re going to text, and what you’re texting them so you can contact them.
In addition, SMS and CRM messages that you send via SMS/CRM can help you understand their status. The app also provides a “Your location” feature that allows you, or anyone else on your end, to track the phone numbers of all your contacts. Barzalari tells me that this is more about how you get used to the phone numbers that come up as your contacts call you. It’s like a number-tag for friends, like the Facebook app, where each number has a unique identifier attached.
For example, this could mean the number has been in touch contact with someone’s number. This could be a very basic number or a number that someone knows or it could be a number that has recently been added. This could be helpful when you need to send a text or a chat that you could remember where to send the link, as the SMS or CRM might be able to help you navigate your contacts for a while.
You can see a live SMS/CRM call on iPhone here. That should be something you’d want to watch on your screen.
The phone number could be used for SMS

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 meaningful and critical of the success of Twitter.
For a company whose mission is to enable users to share, tweet, and find content, Twitter is the perfect way to help users find and enjoy content. It’s also a perfect example of the way the sharing economy is changing, and the “new” economy. I’m not going to speak for all users of Twitter, but that I’m a part of the old economy. 
I’m used to using Twitter and a company back when I was a consumer user, which I miss dearly, before Twitter started its own social apps. 
I have a friend who works on Twitter and Facebook, and he recently told me that his company has been one of the biggest challenges for him.    
Now, thanks to Facebook, we have become the first user to have the ability to search through what our friends are sharing.   
I had a friend who used to use Twitter, but has now switched over to Facebook.  
To my brother in arms, I see this change that we have,” he said. 
This is the world we live in. Social networks have taken over the ability to connect our friends and friends, or people we care for. 
I’m not the only one to see this shift in an individual’s use. Some of my friends feel the same way as I do and we feel compelled to do the same. 
There are several reasons why this is happening. 
For many years, social networks have taken over the ability to search in a way we know we have to do. Twitter just launched a new social search function. Instagram just launched some Instagram filters. (Ok, not even that.) 
The next step is integration with Facebook, which is now a significant sharer of information. 
And as these are the days of transition, we get to the age where social networks begin to dictate what is and is not for our needs, as well as the companies that are pushing us further to be more dependent on them. 
Today, however, we’ve come to a time where we now have to step outside and face the old economy and find ourselves.  
I’m not the only one to be frustrated – by the way, the average user of Twitter and Facebook are not a person who would consider themselves social media junkies (though they do love sharing their favorite songs, photos, movies). 
As they say, that’s a great thing because it will get people to follow you, if you’re the right friend. 
Twitter will continue to continue to help them. 
In the end, Twitter has to become a place where everyone can connect. 
We can get there in the end, but not for another decade. 
If you’re ever in need of a social network, but are a person who loves your friends, then tweet and Facebook are the place to go.  
We’d love to have a Facebook experience, but that can get a little more awkward, than the Instagram experience."
"The launch of WhatsApp for iPad, or the fact that Apple now works with Facebook, and Twitter already has apps like Vine and Vine, may all point to Twitter being the start of a very long-term process. 
It’s one thing to be confused about what kind of an end product is launching for a new mobile platform after just one day at Mobile World Congress.  Now some developers have been able to share a few of their own app experiences on the service, and there’s plenty of time to come and go.  So we’ve been in the hands of developers, both for and against, the past few days, for a while.  The first one this morning to get the scoop on the launch date and whether the new app will support the service, which the company is set to unveil this afternoon, is AppLadies, which is a “web publishing,” app that allows developers to share their experience with the outside world, and then see the reaction upon taking it down from their service.
As I wrote in the piece earlier today: “AppLadies does not have the same feel of Vine, which has had a lot of attention,” the app aims to be something like Vine. 
And, to my friend, who will be using the app throughout and after the launch of WhatsApp, well, you’ll have to take what you’ve created and try it out for yourselves.
One thing you will find yourself spending time with in the app is that it is a fully fledged, open app. That means you share with others, so you don’t have to wait for their approval. It’s also, crucially

 they it’s done the right thing, and then I can tell you about the company, and if you think it could really make my job easier, then I can share that story and help you get more involved,” says O’Reilly.
“If it’s important to you, I want them to have a conversation face-to-face with someone who can actually answer the questions,” he said. “Most importantly, to me as a startup, I want to be able to be able to have a conversation that will become an action piece.”
“I think people are so busy nowadays, they just don’t want to have a conversation with someone who’s really, really personal in how they think they can make something happen. It just doesn’t make sense.”
“There may be two or three hours of the week where someone is trying to make something come together. That seems easy, but it’s hard to know if you’re helping someone through an obstacle and not just the product,” explained O’Reilly."

"One thing that has changed in the last few years is that the tech world’s fascination with Facebook’s WhatsApp app has declined.
The two apps are now in the top 3 free apps in the world — and Facebook’s interest has waned.
But there are still some small changes in the app world. In addition to its focus having shifted to WhatsApp to replace Twitter, Facebook’s app has expanded to other platforms.
Last week, Facebook’s chief operating officer Mark Zuckerberg announced that on mobile, a user had to change to Facebook to make the move. This way users could connect with people through their mobile number rather than their phone number alone when they transferred their phone.
But a couple of points come up:
One of the more interesting points was when Zuckerberg said that the shift to WhatsApp was “the first time Facebook’s mobile apps changed the UI to look the right way the world’s top apps do.”
Zuckerberg described the shift as “a win-win-win for users,” not a ‘just one more’-you-don’t’ll-have-To-Call-a-Number’s-Change-This-Style.’
Zuckerberg also talked about the decision to bring people up to the top app at least two or three times when they were transferred from a phone number alone to a number. He also said that the app had a ‘I’ll-Call-a-Number-A-Time-Later’ feel in certain parts of the world.’
All of this is an interesting look at what people are doing on Facebook. It shows that the company’s messaging center is struggling with growth. Facebook’s growth in the U.S. has suffered as the product gets cheaper across the board, and some of its developers are leaving.
And while the app is free for 15 minutes on the desktop platform, if users continue to use the app or share in a way that Facebook deems a ‘paywall’, they will pay $3.4 million in a year.
Even if Facebook’s user base has decreased, the company will still have some cash left over, which will be used for advertising.
A few people around me were pretty surprised by the change, at the fact that Facebook’s own app seems to be holding up very well. I would suspect that Zuckerberg’s announcement was an attempt to reassure users that they had the best apps in their social network.
Zuckerberg gave a slightly different explanation of the

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 companies of approximately 2,500 square miles worldwide, and 2,500 square miles in the United States.
It’s the first launch of the company’s new mobile app. The platform makes it easy for users to connect with their fellow social networks within a single app. The app is used by Twitter users to sign in with one of their accounts. They can join their friends and family or invite friends to join. For more, check out the company on TechCrunch here.
The new app will not be available until later today, but users will be able to create and join groups of friends and family on Twitter. And they will have to register their interests. They simply need to write about the events that have affected themselves. I’m told there will be more news as the startup grows up, too.
And a small, but important note, of how many of the new users will create groups of people around the Twitter hashtag: around 2,000 to 5,000.
As you probably guessed, the introduction of a mobile iOS application that makes the creation of groups easier to do is a good move.
The company’s founders seem excited about their ability to grow Facebook’s social graph.  I don’t see it as a big deal in the long run, but the new app is important, and it seems to serve a large part of that growth.
The new app also allows for much more customization than you might expect. It is designed to be very simple, with just a few more buttons that you can customize, to your preference. For instance, when you tap on a photo that you own, a menu that lists the number of friends that you can follow. You can choose from the “Friends of Friends” option, or “Fights of Friends” option, or simply one that makes you click. The company wants it to be as simple as possible to create your own groups.
With mobile apps, it’s important to understand your audience, not just your target. You have to think about what kind of people are going to be using the app and use their interests, not their color or their body language.
But you also want to be very careful in the creation of groups on the service, as that will also lead to a very targeted, very high-quality group. That’s why Facebook’s focus on social graph creation is important. Facebook’s application could be a good fit for people just coming from your Facebook news feed.
To help with the launch, the company is going to be releasing “Group Chat.” That will be available right into the app, and you will be able to chat with the other members of your group.
The new software for Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp is a free download.

Group Chat will become available for Android tomorrow. Google will make it available on its mobile OS, Chrome Browser, and Safari later."

"Today, we are launching an all-new web application called LiveCoding, which is designed to help you with all of your technical needs as quickly as possible. The service uses an interface that looks a lot like a website, but instead of being a typical WordPress plug-in, you just download the WordPress plugin, create your profile, add a page, set your preferences, and add additional information.
The website is also built in a visual format, allowing for easy navigation, and sharing with other LiveCoding contributors.
It is designed to be read as a blog or news reader, but with a focus on providing content that most people typically won’t encounter in their personal blogs, but instead find elsewhere on the Web.
If you have trouble managing your profile details, you can simply create another link on the LiveCoding website, then choose which LiveCoding plugin you want to work with your own settings. This makes it easy to quickly add the different plugins into your profile and then create your profile links.

While LiveCoding is focused on a few specific use cases, it’s free to use. You can sign up for a free WordPress account, or just use the website, which allows you to start a free profile.
LiveCoding is also trying to offer a service beyond just coding on the site as well, which, by the way, does not include a paid tier.
The service currently offers, for example, a blog post that explains the basics of your company. After you create your profile, you can write about a specific project.
This is a feature that’s very much in demand among the developers, as people often struggle to understand exactly what their product is, and not because they’re a blogger by blog, but because they don’t have a complete set of information to present. The site allows developers to use other tools, like a visual editor or even a different blog for their news, but we encourage LiveC

, with a £20/€25 minimum to attend and a £40 ticket price to attend and a second-in-the-air VIP to get in. We’ll be heading to the Arena Berlin tomorrow."
"Today and the day before tomorrow, there will be another new tech company. It will make a similar appearance, which will probably make a lot of noise for a few days and then quietly disappear. But this time, it won’t be a big deal.
The TechCrunch Disrupt is the second annual gathering of “disruptors.” TechCrunch has previously dubbed the D.E.A.T. “The Geekiest Disrupt.”
At the Disrupt conference, Disrupt.me, a tech conference and conference on campus, takes over a TechCrunch campus in San Francisco. Disrupt.me has been a long-running event, and the idea for an event comes from Disrupt creator Sam Altman from Y Combinator.
As Altman says: “What Disruption.Me can do is the same thing. It doesn’t just bring you an incredible event… it’s a “discovery” opportunity because Disrupt.me is about discovery, and that’s exciting.”
When Altmon’s keynote aired at Disrupt: Disrupt, he told the audience that startups and incumbents are struggling to keep up with the rapid innovation.
Alt.me is another startup that brings back a “discovery”, Alt.me is a “discovery” for the audience. It can bring back a “discovery” that reveals the startup behind Alt.me — who was also the founder and CEO of Altitude. Alt.me will be held in the Stadium San Francisco, and Alt.me has attracted a lot of attention as Alt.me was the first crowdfunded, private conference that we hosted at the TechCrunch campus.
Disrupt.me is also sponsored by the Disrupt conference.
The Disrupt conference kicks off with a big presentation by Alt.me’s founders, panel with interviews from the best minds in Silicon Valley, and a party for the “Disruptor.” A “Disruptor.” is someone who enters the Disrupt stage, and they are given 60 minutes to present their new idea.
Disruptors’ Pitch-off
The Pitch-off at Disrupt makes sure that the Disrupt is properly pitched to the right crowd and with the right people. In the pitch-off, the “Disruptor.” is the “discovery” that the Disruptor is given with 60 minutes to pitch their concept live in the arena at Disruptor and with their fellow Disruptors and TechCrunch readers. The Pitch-off is a chance to “discover” a startup from the “Discovery” stage that doesn appear at Disrupt.
Disruptor-Discovery
Disruptor Discovery is the “discovery” for the Pitch-off. The Pitch-off’s “Discovery” happens daily in the TechCrunch Stadium SF. Alt.me will be held on the 8th of September at 9am. The Pitch-off is live, and we’ll be running it live on Twitter from 8am to 9am Eastern Time.
There are now over 50 Disruptors and Pitch-Off participants waiting to be revealed at Disrupt.
Disruptor-Meetup
Disruptor Meetup is a new, exclusive event that takes over a Disruptor’s campus in San Francisco. The Meetup will take place in Civic Center Plaza with registration on the main Disruptors website.
When the Pitch-off begins, there are only six Pitchers available. If the Pitch-off’s “Discovery” happens, and we’ll have the “Discovery” live before the competition even begins, The Meetup is also a great way to meet your favorite Pitchers at the Disruptor’s Hall
TechCrunch Disrupt
TechCrunch Disrupt is a TechCrunch Disrupt of the “TechCrunch Arena” in San Francisco featuring Disrupt.
TechCrunch Disrupt has become one of the best attended Disrupts of all time and one of the most influential, drawing the eyes of all that attend. The Disrupt is a showcase for all things new and cool.
TechCrunch Disrupt Summer 2012: The Movie
The Summer 2012 Disrupt takes place on campus in Palo Alto at the TechCrunch Campus on June 19-26, where you can join our movie night, watch the TechCrunch Fireside Chat, and buy tickets. We’ll be live and videochatting all night! You can get to the Summer, and the Summer Movie

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 current on-demand delivery services from Google, Uber etc to a restaurant chain and eventually on to retail and more sophisticated offerings.
There are plenty of ways in this industry to avoid getting caught out by this change to the taxonomy, and for a startup trying to grow, it has to keep an eye out for all this, from legal to illegal to tax.
That’s what Apple and Amazon’s discussion of “failing to predict” a tax could mean for the future of an IPO’s board.
Of course, in the end it may come down to whether or not the U.S. government gets to see their big wisdom and get wise’s before deciding whether their digital, global footprint is worth it. Or it will have to find out before it makes its move, which will take a lot longer than the five minute warning they will see."
"A while back I wrote about what we call “the first app.” It was Apple’s decision to not launch PlayNow on Android (or any other operating system) when it could have had a much broader reach. As the game has become much more interesting overall, we now have an app store full of hundreds of apps.
The fact that this is a pretty crowded space is good news for both companies. The difference, however, is that Apple’s own app store is not nearly as large as Google’s at all. And Google’s is not quite as focused on growth as Apple is, if this is anything.
At least not as focused, in what has been a pretty lean times for both. When Google launched Play, it introduced a number of “apps” that included “app developers” which could be a bigger target at the moment. And at Google I don’t believe that Google Play as app store will ever happen again.
What, however, does all this say about startups seeking to compete for investors who are now mostly focused on growth, even and especially during the time when the app is being valued more than $1 billion? 
These aren’t app stores, they’re apps with real-life, compelling reasons for being there. If you’ve seen apps before, you probably got the feel that the app store is where the apps go when customers can test and get things fixed inside the app.
At this point, they can’t really point to exactly why the audience would want to buy appstore apps. That means that the game, the game of appstores, will grow more interesting and competitive in the future, but that still hasn’t changed Google’s approach to expanding apps.
“App stores are just the tip of the iceberg,” the Google Play store said in June. “I’ve been a fan of Android for a long time, but I have to admit that it has come down to what apps do and what they actually do, and that’s something Google still believes”
Google’s approach to expanding apps was to first focus on developing apps with features that would be useful to both consumers and businesses, such as apps that encourage shopping lists, allow you to navigate your phone for things like restaurants, books, magazines and games, etc. That is, in fact, the strategy the company has taken for its recent apps.
But Google is also in the mobile era, after all. The company is arguably more at risk on the mobile side of things because Android isn’t the only OS running on a cell device.
It’s not just the fact that Android and the OS on which it is run have changed over time — the way Android apps are being developed has also changed.
For a lot of developers who want to target a new product category in the space — Google’s Google Play store is up over 40,000 apps to date. That number represents a lot more than the 50 app stores Google has been putting on since its inception, with the average being around one.
There are now around 40 different app stores, mostly targeting business and enterprise, and there are others out there that are even bigger. Facebook has around 20 apps, too, and Apple, for example, has at least three or so, according to the iOS App Store.
But all of these app stores are really apps, and Google’s Google Play store is more specifically a “mobile-only” game. In other words, mobile gaming apps. Apple’s App Store is still the company’s first choice to get their apps installed and used. But that may not be the deciding factor, even with these big‐name apps.
If you’re at a point when you want to start thinking about whether an appstore is an idea worthwhile considering,

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
Hertzel] told me, “I don’t know if there are a lot of cases where you need a certain device, or a certain feature… if you need a really large device or small device”.
So how did the team find the extra juice? “They had a look at a lot of our customer database and a picture of my face,” he said.
It may not be totally clear, but my face is pretty small if I was only a little bit tall.
When a product company does something different with their product, it shows a little more value. What could it have done if the whole company was using it? The more the product’s value gets out to their customers, the better the product will do.
For example, a company could set a limit based on the amount of money they’d have to save their money to the device that they’re saving on. This could be done in case the user got a bad bill or made a couple of bad payments.
It’s the ‘no extra charge’ option that looks like the most interesting. But it’s not actually the only one. Many companies have made it so that if your bank or Visa or Mastercard goes into your personal data like a credit card number or Social Security number, for instance – even if you’re paying for your device, you don’t have to pay extra.
Of course, that’s just what Apple and others are doing with their devices, but it could be a great option for a lot of customers.
At the same time, if you don’t have a great smartphone or smartphone with great video recording or even a great photo-or video-editing app, it’s probably worth thinking that you don’t need to pay extra to get up close and personal with your face."
"Facebook’s recently launched facial recognition tech, and today there exist some amazing results so far.
If you don’t already know who this person is, they are a Facebook employee who loves all things social media and sports. He recently graduated from Y Combinator’s Winter 2014 batch, and they even got to spend time together on a vacation to Hawaii.
During our discussion earlier this afternoon, Chris and I discussed how much his passion for sports helped him get through college, and how his other interests and passions influence his work.
Now that Chris is a senior, it makes a little more sense to me when he’s choosing to become a tech entrepreneur and employee. In his experience, as a person who has been through some life changes, he’s been at the tail end of several different stages of life — from becoming a first-grader to a student on the verge of a major break.
I asked him who would win in a battle of wits and strategy, and he said, “Honestly, I don’t like to play games. I like to build stuff.”
But he still loves to see how well people are using their data. (Yes… I have a pretty big brain)
I also told him that I had a few friends that are close to him and they were always in need of help with something.
In other words, if you’re not at a point in your career where you are on-site to learn about information about your favorite events and topics, find a group of people you really respect, help them out of issues, and provide some kind of feedback — you’re likely to have a better place to spend your time than on mobile.
We talked about some different types of technology that would be useful if you’re going through some kind of transition; he mentioned his favorite: using crowdsourced photos and videos, which is something you can do right now, because it allows you to post them publicly and have them visible to your team mates; and sharing those photos and videos, but not always with a link, because you can share them with others and see how that’s viewed by your teammates.

I mentioned “Face-To-Face” interaction, which he said it makes a lot of sense for the workplace that you work for. I asked him if there were many people he would trust, especially if they had already made videos, and he replied on Reddit, it’s just because everyone has videos.
But he also noted that there are other people who don’t like to post, only like to watch and share videos. (Weirdly, Chris said he doesn’t have a Facebook account, so that seems unlikely to me)

He did all these things because what he likes is his teammates’ videos, which are, he said, “more meaningful” than what he could post about them anyway. Because there are a lot more people looking at them

 supporting a new version of the app that enables a single task – to take an action.
The new version of Evernote, released in December, offers enhanced support for multitasking, meaning multiple actions can be scheduled in order to complete one goal, such as meeting obligations, and other tasks. The new features, such as multitasking, are automatically supported, allowing users to get the most out of their existing Evernote experience. (The most notable addition was in the task-tracking section – the main purpose of that was to organize to-dos in a more visual, easier-to-read format. The new features, which include the following features, are available via a separate Evernote blog post, but it is worth noting that some of the functionality which was added earlier today is missing.)
One other potential concern for consumers who use Evernote across their workday – if it’s a productivity project – is the question of whether they’re able to see the activity which they’re assigned to. There are no shortcuts to a task from Evernote, of course – in other words, what it’s all about is taking one action, and if those actions are tied to their completion, it’s an awful feeling. This is another issue which is an important one for Evernote’s long-term prospects for success.
Here are the enhancements to Evernote 7.1.1 – with additional info below.
The update includes enhancements to the email tracking, and also improved support for the iPhone 5s, plus the ability to download a version of the app that is used by the press, too, according to a statement from Evernote.
The company also announced a number of bug fixes.
Evernote also had good news to share, too:

The new updates were live on its Facebook page for iOS 7.0."
"I’m not talking about Google+’s rise in a vacuum, as that trend is already happening. What I am talking about is the continued struggle of the digital divide.
Google+ is still very much in its early days. Google+ still has a chance. We only have 30 days of Android to go and all it needs is a few days."
"On the heels of Google’s “Anniversary of Google Glass” press conference today and the consumer release that it is officially available to consumers in the U.S. today, another company is announcing that it will be available to consumers in the U.S. and Europe in 2013, too. The company’s Unlock Glass program will begin to offer rewards just as Google Glass does (such as unlocking Glass and buying a pair of specs and accessories), and will be aimed at those users who “really look at glasses as a part of their everyday experience.”
The details of the program are pretty impressive. The Rewards program is going to start announcement of the program in November. After that point, it will allow users to unlock “the first 30 people who will qualify for the program.” According to the company, “Participants will receive a Google Glass Explorer Glass which will identify them as a Glass Explorer without having to know their username.” The Google Glass Explorer Glass will be available to them at retail stores, online sales and in selected stores in the U.S., Europe, as well as via their smartphone at stores in the U.S., if they wish to purchase an “experience-related wearable computer device.”
This system will be available to them in person at the event, but you can download the Google Glass app here.
With the release, Google is going to make a big bet that consumers around the world are going to want the program, and not just users in America or Europe. The Rewards program in its first iteration required users to commit to going to one or two locations per day for each “experience” they committed to. After testing out the Glass program, the company found that many people are looking specifically for more information on what they have to do than they might be interested in seeing themselves.
“Google Glass rewards could help people discover the best online content and apps,” says Google Glass project lead and Google’s David Ebersmann. “It will encourage people to become more interested and engaged with their Internet experience and Google+ social network.”
While Google Glass has never been an obvious marketing success, it’s very easy to see Google+ being able to build strong social components around the product. Google, as the parent company, is going to be heavily involved in Google+ and will presumably be able to invest in other Google projects like Glass.
Google Glass has been something of a stealth project, so it will probably be a while before it becomes something that can start affecting consumer behavior. But the fact that

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
.

As a reminder, here’s what the company was trying to accomplish here: the aim was to create a brand new interface for the product.

And, with all his experience, I’ve asked him if there are any lessons that he can take back and share with the team to create a more user-facing experience here:
First of all, the app is pretty large. I couldn’t quite keep a track of all the different components of the product, but this app would look far more familiar and polished if it were smaller than the app it is today.

It also has a very familiar user interface, which is a bit outdated, but it’s really just this: the user can browse and find items on the “Home page.”
You can also browse your other items, which you can only see in the context that they are displayed in the app. (Also, by default, you can only see this item if it appears to have the same feature set as the other items it is trying to match.)
You also can't search within a given category. You need to first choose one from a list of categories, and then you can begin browsing that list.
There are a lot of features today, and a lot of them are really just a way, but this is definitely a platform where you can leverage some of what is working today.
One thing I really noticed is the ability to pick up items within the app, which I think is really useful for developers. That means that you could search through your category on the home page, find a product on your top “to do” list, add an item, and the app will process your selection and show you “selected items” automatically.
And you can pick items, but if you pick an item, you’re choosing “selected items,” and the app will process your selection and then show you the items you’ll find.
If you need to customize the app, you can do that. In the next version, the app will allow developers to add their own features to the platform in addition to the core “selected items” list and feature set.
I don’t see any bugs or issues anywhere today, so this has really been a great experience. I wish the engineers had more time to polish this stuff up, but I think they’ve taken longer to build and polish than they should. This was probably because when you have an API, you need to have the APIs, and when you try to build with native developers, you need it to have native support. I think this is still a lot better, though, and, with all developers, that really could change. (I hope they get there.)
I want to give some tips for making your product stand out to others, too, which are going to be more of a “how to” type of advice. (I’ve asked this of others. For example:
That was my last article about the app."
"You may remember the story of Rabbitbridge. Or Pixster, or *a*.  You may have heard or may have seen the company from its earliest days as an app where users could share music through the app’s “Browsing” feature. That is still the case. Today, the app is expanding its features and functionality, and it looks like it may be a good time to join the party, too.
Today, the company has raised $1 million in $700K in seed funding, the startup revealed today. It has also expanded from its original focus on music to offer video playback, video chat, a way for you to use its app not just to search and browse for movies but, more importantly, its addition to video streaming, which includes music playback.
The company is also adding video sync (though the feature is only available now, users who have previously been using the Browsing feature will upgrade immediately), and another big-new feature is now being added. That is, the app now also makes it possible, on iOS, to view all your movies without having to scroll to the start of the play.
To do so, the app shows video play buttons over videos. The way this works, however, is that there are an infinite number of movie buttons.  When you click that, the app’s video play mode is activated and a video plays. Once you confirm it has successfully connected, however, that is the action.
The addition of video support has been more of an afterthought for years now, but Rabbitbridge, which offers one of the first online video services in a way, had originally only made a limited update for one movie — and, in any case, the company was not happy with the changes it

 menu is also available in a number of other languages. There’s already a “French” button on the site to enable your language settings, and the iPhone app is now also available that lets you send messages, email, social updates, and files between two users without having to download and install SMS.
Twitter also now supports all iOS and Android apps for its service, which has been available for a year now. The service is an open source, GPL v2, and is available on both Android and iOS.
With all the new APIs, and now native code, Twitter is clearly looking to find more ways to do more with Twitter, like better user management, or better messaging, or making it easier to get in touch with your friends. A new search feature might be an early first step in that direction.
“If this is what you think of the new Twitter experience before you’ve used the service, that will happen,” says Twitter. “Soon”.
The search function allows you to search the service by keyword, type or by using categories and keywords.
You can also use Twitter search to search across streams of Tweets. This lets you search the service by using a Google account and also Twitter accounts. It just opens the app and is available from your phone. The same goes for Twitter search across the web (this also opens the app and is available on your phone).
For example, @mikelew said in a Tweet he just sent, “I just tried using Twitter search and they’re super easy to use. Twitter search worked”
While many people would probably be in favor of faster messaging, the app might also be a great way for kids to use Twitter’s messaging services and find other resources. The native app is also available in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Italian-Austrian translation, and includes basic features like messaging, photos, and videos.
In other languages, you’ll soon also have an option to browse by favorite or follow users and browse their Tweets by hashtags or keywords.
On the flip side, @changhong said in a Tweet, “Twitter search isn’t exactly Twitter Search, but it does the job just fine for what most people need. I have a friend on Twitter, who likes a song, but doesn’t tweet about it. I have also seen other people do Twitter searches like a photographer, for instance. But for this person, search is the new Twitter Search’."
"Twitter is going to change things up today. The company launched the “Twitter for Business” campaign, which means the introduction of new tools designed for companies that want to use Twitter to help them improve the experience for their customers. The initial group includes Twitter and Amazon, along with other companies that already have a Twitter account. When you subscribe, those companies get notified that their services will be integrated into the company’s apps in the future.
At first, these integrations will be rolled out over a very quick process, but later on, they’ll be available across the company. Update: Amazon also announced its acquisition of Twitter today.
This is a change from what’s been in place for the past: Twitter’s integration tools are supposed to be rolled out over a few days. You can also sign up for a Twitter account here.
When contacted, Twitter didn’t exactly have the best response to the news. According to CNN, an official Twitter spokesperson suggested that it would take several days to integrate all of these services and integrate all of them into applications.
In fact, according to CBS, they could possibly take all day to get to all applications. (Twitter provides you with a daily limit on how many applications you can use at a time.)
So what does this have to do with Twitter for Business? “The integration of Twitter for Business is a huge deal and the integration of Twitter for Business would not have been possible without Twitter integration and integration,” a company spokesperson said in a statement today. “The integration of Twitter Business would be an essential first step for your business. We are looking to integrate these services in hundreds of applications so that Business users are always able to access them. So, our business partners want to know all this very important information and just wait as long as they get notice of this.”
As soon as you sign up via Twitter account, Twitter for Business begins with a business account. It also uses your Google account so that you can use other companies' services, like Spotify. This will be your “Business Account,” so to speak. It includes the following terms, as well.
You can also use our web profiles with your Twitter profile. The account begins with the following terms. You can also use our Web profiles or the @changhong.com URLs or our web pages to

s it’s a lot like Twitter — there’s this sense of authenticity and openness”, says Heilman. “We like to focus on the community, and that’s something we have in common with Twitter — we find ourselves on a social media network that’s more focused on news and entertainment. There’s a difference because Twitter really isn’t about news and entertainment,” he adds.
The newly expanded team will focus on product for HootSuite — initially a marketplace for HootSuite’s social content, as well as for advertisers to buy social media ads across these platforms (like Twitter)."
"With the proliferation of smartphones and tablets, more and more digital companies are opening up new offices and creating more space for employees. In New York, it’s Yandex. with its Brooklyn headquarters, and it has also done away with some offices in other parts of the United States.
Yandex released an announcement about its new Manhattan location last year, which didn’t seem to be a major factor for the team creating the new space, but the company could still be viewed as a sign of its continued growth in these increasingly crowded spaces.
Yandex, which was acquired by Microsoft last year for $2.99 billion, is building more space in Brooklyn as it moves into the citywide expansion. In Brooklyn, Yandex also is opening a new location in Brooklyn Center, according to its most recent report. That isn’t directly related to the Brooklyn location, but it’s close to it because the Yandex engineers grew up there and were brought on there to build search and navigation services, according to the report.
Yandex has also been busy expanding across the world as well. It moved to Upper Lake West, outside of downtown, last year, and in the past year it has opened its Brooklyn headquarters; and it’s also been looking to move into other markets, like San Francisco, Seattle and Silicon Valley.
Yandex’s recent success with finding new employees is a good sign for other companies that are increasingly looking to recruit engineers from outside their own borders.
This is especially important because it also means that companies are taking a larger step towards becoming more self-sustained companies that are already paying wages. “The trend is away from being dependent on a large corporation or corporation,” says Yandex’s founder Rival, Andreessen Horowitz, in a speech about the company’s development. “We are looking for ourselves to become a company on our own.”
Some other companies looking to recruit staff outside their own walls in the era of self-sustaining enterprises include Google, Uber and Microsoft, Yandex is an interesting example."
"Facebook has just announced a new set of services called Messenger Services -- apps that help its social network connect more closely to businesses and services, making them more likely candidates to make the necessary inroads.
Messaging services can’t be counted out as the primary driver of Facebook’s growth, though. Services like Messenger are still in the early stages of their evolution. That’s partly because of how fragmented the industry is, and it also might mean that a company like Facebook is willing to sacrifice some degree of privacy in the interest of getting the platform to work more closely to help businesses run their businesses.
It’s the latter two components that are especially fascinating. Facebook is introducing a third-party service called “Message Me” to enable people to make messaging more intimate -- it can’t be used outside the Messenger app. And it’s adding ways to use Messenger Services with third-party services like Uber and Airbnb.
The idea is you could send each other specific messages or other personal messages. Companies could pick those messages out to see who was the person they’re texting, if it’s only a small number of people and other services don’t already have them.
The company also says Messenger Services are designed to work directly in your messaging app -- meaning that no data is shared with strangers, and Messenger can access these messages without having to use location tools.
Facebook says Messenger services will start going live in October, in just a few months’ time.
It’s not the only company that has started to develop more mobile apps. Just last week Twitter began allowing people to chat on its iOS App Store directly from the lock screen."
"Apple hasn’t changed its mobile OS at this time, but today Apple is giving its iOS 11-inch and 12-inch tablets with Retina displays a major upgrade. The update, as you may know, brings

com, and now more. (Well, probably not.) That’s also a major step in terms of expansion to other countries outside of North America — although that’s clearly still a possibility, in part because the company is still looking for outside shareholders. And it also still needs to find a way to monetize that audience, to drive repeat business. (It’s not free, with Amazon offering full ad-supported Amazon Prime video, which provides the service with a $35 monthly plan.)
When Amazon has an offer for a service you’ can cancel (or not), you can just call customer support, and then that service will refund your money. That’s a fair way to put it, but it’s also not entirely guaranteed.
As of the late nineties, you could get away with calling yourself a “consumer rights lawyer,” but it was more of a “consumer justice lawyer” during the turn of the millenium. That’s still how consumers feel about Google.
A company that doesn’t have the best reputation to match its image of a smart and ethical company in the public mind may just be making a mistake — but that’s exactly the kind of mistake I’m still hoping to make."
"Microsoft, in a fairly standard announcement, announced this fall’s ‘Windows 8 Start’s Platform, an open standard that offers developers access to Microsoft’s Windows software in a standard browser for Internet Explorer, Firefox and Google Chrome.
To use the Windows 8 Start, developers typically have to install an internet explorer-sized file called Microsoft-Startup.pk file. This file is the start of the Windows Store, and is where developers can get the code you’ve compiled during their development.
The file contains files with various Windows software such as  MS-WindowsRT-Startup.pk, MS-Windows-RT-Startup.pk and the .com name. The file itself is an HTML5 document which contains the .com name plus the  MS URL of the start site.
The file contains all the Microsoft software the start has. It looks like the name of their site. As I see it, it was only made for IE and it looks a bit generic for Windows 8, so to speak. I’ve also got a Windows 7 computer which needs to install an internet explorer-based media player. This file didn’t make the cut. However, it does work from XP and up, so I just had to add a step to check that.
The Internet Explorer web browser is available in Microsoft’s browser for Windows. This browser lets you browse a web site from other pages in a window, and that’s quite similar to the Start screen of Windows 7.
The Start.pk file lets developers create a page from other pages which you can then share via social APIs. If you have a Web Server install, you can do some basic parsing and file upload, but I found it to require some serious engineering to get any browser to run.
The web server makes the file from some of your HTML5 applications. By default, this server takes control over access to the files you post from <user-name>/<userID> to Windows. It also takes control of whether or not you are posting, which is pretty nifty.

The platform will work in Windows 8, but not necessarily for everyone. I ran into a problem using Windows Update, which had to be installed from the desktop in Windows 7, and even then I was not entirely convinced. I used Windows Update and it didn’t work. If you are using a Windows 8 environment, you can still configure a startup from Windows 8 which will install the Windows Update server locally on your own machine.
However, I found there was no startup option for some reason. I guess Microsoft didn’t change their policies so the new startup from Windows RT-Windows.xml look better. (Update: I did discover a workaround: I opened Windows RT-Windows.xml in my Start menu, and that’s how I solved the problem.)
So here’s the new Microsoft Start.pk file:
This should work in Windows RT 8, but not necessarily. In case it does though, you can still install an internet explorer-like page as an Internet Explorer application from your start.
There is more than that. Microsoft seems to be listening to developers with Windows RT-Start, and there is no shortage of Microsoft software you could use for the new Internet Explorer, so I’d be interested to hear what they have to say about it. (I hope they come up with some new way to share from your start!)  "

 mark.
In spite of its youth, it does have an impressive product portfolio: the company lists over 12 million customers and is already profitable (with over one million in the Fortune 500 category). Now that the business is turning off its head and has a plan to become a standalone entity, it is now ready to begin building a new platform, according to its CEO, and it will be a big move."
"Today has arrived, the first night of summer. It isn’t often that summer, but it’s usually the time of year when our eyes are wandering outside. Sure, some of the most successful startups take advantage of the season, but these usually require a bit of a head-turning couponing or other savvy maneuvering, especially in the form of a seed round. If you’re looking for startup to take a peek at, this year was one of the most exciting in terms of venture capital capital dollars.
As always, the numbers are even more impressive, reaching out to more than 30 VCs and more than 300 companies over the past two weeks, where there were 12 million combined dollars thrown at companies across 10 cities.
This year, the year-to-date, the year-over-year growth rate of venture capital dollars and dollar volume are just staggering: there are now more than 200 VCs on the payrolls of the more than 300 startups that are active in the state of California.
That’s a total of 3,600 VCs in the ranks, which says that the total number of accredited startups in California is up about 2,400% in just one year, with 10,000 percent year-over-year growth.
There are also more than 1,500 companies that have received money from the state of California and 10,000 percent year-over-year growth. Some are new startups, others have come over from elsewhere, but the overwhelming majority of these entrepreneurs in that regard are startups.
Of course, Silicon Valley is also seeing its startup ecosystem grow, with the last time the last couple of years witnessed a big run up in venture capital dollars flowing into this region.
Of course, any time you have a startup coming online, you are probably not far and away from being a startup, so take care of it while you are in the market. Take time to plan, plan, do your best to make things happen. And if it’s going to take some time, be very careful in the name of profits because you aren’t going to make as fast as you should have been.

"A day later: the next day on the calendar. It’s a big weekend. TechCrunch Disrupt, Y Combinator, TechCrunch Disrupt.  But there is one thing that always seems to annoy startups: having to attend the same one every year to pitch business out of the gate, meet people, demo and try to connect up the dots.
So the day after the last one of Y Combinator’s Demo Days. What will it be like?
The Demo Days are an out-of-the-gate event where the top 20 companies in the Y Combinator batch make sense — the best entrepreneurs and founders of the world. And they are incredibly well attended. The last Demo Days in January weren’t that big, but they’re still quite interesting.  This year’s batch will be up to 30 companies, or just shy of that.
We are expecting a great bunch — there are 20 startups who are already on the list, and one or two others already in the Top 5 companies in the first batch.
There will be a few things up between those companies, but here are the big ones. First, there will be a single pitch competition, where the next 15 companies will compete live through video chat. Second, this year, we will be announcing the 5 companies chosen for the main pitch competition. 
And that leads me to the 3 companies that I’d pick to have a shot at winning each contest.
So, I won’t take anything from all of you unless you win it all yourself, so I guess I just need to get more on top end.
Here are the 3 startups I’d pick to win the contest. As there are currently only 3 winners on the list, you won’t get points if you are in the top 3 because it doesn’t appear there is a winner on the list.
If you want to become a judge on this contest, email me at coofounders@techcrunch.com.

I’d pick my favorites, and they are available here. Just let me know if you plan to attend the next Demo Day.
You can sign up here."

,” he states. “The best way to get in the market to really start taking off is to build a big team, and start building technology. But the key is whether you are already in the market and growing on the back end or in the front end – the same market – as well as building a mobile app that connects to the platform on the side.”
But beyond product design, what are most people actually looking to build? Not building a product, but rather “a piece of software.” As such, there is plenty of opportunity here in the consumer space, too, with developers building things that make sense for making the service available at a low cost or no cost, using a number of different ways to get from A/B testing to the actual consumer launch. One could suggest that the latter approach is less likely for Facebook as it’s focused on building a number of consumer-facing services in the form of its service marketplace, while it’s also worth pointing to the aforementioned Google, which launched last year with a Google+ product, which now lets developers create and build Google+ Apps without any technical background.
But beyond being a platform, if Facebook isn’t already on that level already, then it’s a time for the company to take further steps up the road to user adoption, at least from a product standpoint, given the size and expertise that it brings to bear being a product.
As is often the case with startup business models in the hardware space, it’s going to require more experimentation from Facebook in the form of more testing over time, in the hopes that that user feedback will be incorporated into their platform. In the case of this, that means continued efforts to build and iterate on things to provide a more efficient API with the ability to pull in data from sources other partners are needed, especially in the case of Google Play devices, because of Google’s Google Play Store app store API, and its Android developer platform. Similarly, as is often the case with some developers of iOS and Android (for iOS and Android both) that are going to be more easily influenced by feedback than those of their existing customers.
As we know, the Android app that Facebook launched today was originally built for a different version of Google Play, but after a series of integrations, the product itself was essentially rebuilt on top of that and on top of new SDKs and APIs, creating Facebook Play version 3, which included a lot of functionality. While an official release of the mobile development code would then be made available to third-party developers, it’s still far from a perfect day for all, but the startup can focus on trying to put in enough of effort into its development efforts that they can start to build from that platform, instead of trying to build the same app in every version, and so on.
For the time being, if you want to buy or plan to purchase any of Facebook Play, then you can head here.
But in other circles, it’s also worth thinking to how Facebook sees its future, in the context of what its founders — and CEO, and head of the Business — have been about. Here’s a breakdown of how Facebook looks on its products:
A few thoughts on the situation in Facebook, however:
Facebook could still be in it’s own way a longer term. The company’s focus is mainly on building a mobile platform — a platform that is a part of both what developers build on, and the way that developers build on top of it. In terms of its own product, Facebook has been the only one (on both platforms) to focus on product-driven development, as is often the case in a long-timed development environment. (There are companies like Grouper, which were notable in the past, too. For example, Grouper raised $9.5 million off Series C funding last year. Grouper also raised a separate round led by Google Capital Partners, which was part of a Google+-inspired accelerator program, at which Google Ventures and Google co-founder Sergey Brin joined Grouper.)
While users themselves can decide whether or not they’re more or less engaged, Facebook will likely keep doing the best that they can do, but it does not seem like they’re necessarily interested in trying to develop a platform that would do so, given the company’s emphasis on the platform as a platform. 
Facebook seems to think this approach is the key to the company moving forward, and what it means for Facebook developers and end users, too."

early. The company offers a basic plan, starting at $10, which is $20 more than most other carriers. Then you can decide to upgrade, or pay to upgrade. It has a plan that costs $25 per month and will begin working on the first week it’s open.
What’s better, then, is the pricing on each month if you’re already a current T-Mobile employee, then the $250 premium plan that includes the discount.
But, because the plan is not sold through T-Mobile, this is where the company is also looking to compete by offering a premium plan with unlimited data for $50 per month to those signed up in T-Mobile’s network. That’s when you can choose between three different tiers of plans (three for $20, two for $10, and one for $20) with a different amount.
In practice, this is going to sound rather than the typical “we’re so far behind” excuse, but if you’re just about to get your feet wet, you may not want to hold over a bit of money until you think you’ve made enough in payments. (In that case, you don’t want to hold all your money).
The premium plan will start at $30,000, which is how much T-Mobile is going to ask for each month to use the phone, as of mid-June. The price depends on the number and speed of your use, plus the amount and type of service you want, too. For example, if you only want 1GB of storage, then T-Mobile is going to cost you $45,000. If there are 2GB or more I’ll pay $60,000 instead.

It also adds to the $100 a month to sell the device through the mobile store. When T-Mobile says you’ve sold 1 GB to the carrier, it takes a few business days for T-Mobile to send you a confirmation. When I bought 1GB with my last T-Mobile bill to another carrier, I couldn’t even call the guy to make the request. It seemed that the process is already a bit confusing on my end.
I guess I’ll just have to pay more. But I know the guy who’s going around with me.

It also helps that T-Mobile will have the best customer support network in the business, with a team that includes the entire support team from the carrier.
This is where T-Mobile gets more business.
The premium plan and the 1GB-storage plan are so priced. You can use the phone for any kind of use, but the more value you get, the more you pay. Plus, you get unlimited talk, text, and data, but you’ll lose that if you don’t use the phone often. It’s a shame, though, that I can see how some people spend years in the past year upgrading from what they have only a small amount of money in cash, but not pay anything for a mobile phone that doesn’t show results when you pay every day.

T-Mobile says they’re working on a cheaper storage plan, then there will be a discount, but the company plans to release the discount in time for customers to use the phone for their next phone. The offer will cost 50 credit, which is $15. It’s going to run $2.7 million in credits per month to use the phone. The price change I made is to $5 credit per month in April, so that’s one credit per month for $2.7 million.
The free promotional price for T-Mobile’s promotional credit is $500. Credit can be used by texting T-Mobile #CDN for 500 credits, for example. That offers 8GB of 4G capacity to use the phone, or 100 credit can be used for 12GB of 4G data.
Of course, this isn’t going to replace the full-featured versions of T-Mobile’s phones, but it’s nice to have. If you need less storage or you want to be even more flexible, you won’t be happy.
I’ll let you know when this gets out to you, as it was my way to reach you when you were away from your usual mobile location. But you have to admit at this point that many people have the same problem as I do.
It’s been five years since I started this blog. And by the time I write this, my first child will be entering the world," she said.
She has more, but this is a great introduction to T-Mobile and its plans. While it makes sense to think that mobile phones are going to be a big opportunity for the likes of T-Mobile and the

 the user by simply adding an existing account in a matter of seconds. And if you don’t have a lot of time to wait for that to happen (and don’t feel like having a Facebook account is right for that), you can tap the “SMS Push” button to do so, and the app will create a one-tap “Send me to Facebook” link on your profile page to send me to Facebook.
At any time, a Facebook messenger is available in a variety of voice and video calling modes.
Now, I can expect to receive my phone call and not worry about the “SMS Push” option or any of the many others. That’s because a voice chat is the right combination of text and video to make the most sense of my life. You can expect to receive a call at any time, and I’ll know it’s there, so I’m more likely to open my phone.
The Skype integration is a huge upgrade, too. When we first heard about the merger last year, I was disappointed that the Skype integration wasn’t done yet. Now, I can just start a call and I’m free that day."
"“Don’t tell me you forgot your contacts,” I’m used to being told as a customer advocate, and it’s been a real pain the last few weeks. I’m so, so thankful for Facebook’s improved “Find Friends’ feature.” It’s easy, but it’s too time-consuming for me when I’m on the road… But now there’s even easier on the eyes to remember to “Click”,” which, when I’m lost, is a huge pain.
Now I have Facebook integration with Lyft, which means I no longer have to search for my friends at the point I want to text them. In fact, I’m much more likely to reach out to people at the airport just before I leave to show them my friends’ posts, as opposed to just “I’m busy” (to be honest, I’m just trying to be more social!). If I’m planning on catching the plane (which I’m not, thanks Yikes) and want to reach out, I can now send them a “Need to see you’s profile” or “Have fun with [insert a friend’s name or the top of a page in friend’s News Feed”) and get in. If they want to text back before they’re out, I’m like, “Oh, you’re my first contact” so I’ll be even more likely to text.
Another feature I’ve been eager to get is called “Instant” messaging. Instant messaging is kind of a weird word, I’m sure, but it sounds cool, and I’ll be excited to see how it plays out in the world; I’m also curious about how it would look on my friends’ backgrounds, so I’m also looking forward to seeing that.
And a more technical question: Does Instant messaging work by text or phone? I’m not sure. But since I know my friends so well, I imagine being able to immediately make those instant connections, which is definitely something I’ll miss in practice. That’s another topic for another day."
"Amazon’s stock rose more to $10.59 per share on the morning of June 24. It’s up more than 20% since September 28 when it first started the trading session in the last week. The stock’s first gain since the September 26 announcement that the company would not make a move.
The stock’s price rising was confirmed by analyst at the Bloomberg Terminal.
The company is now trading at $9.92 after the markets opened at noon EDT and the market’s starting to open. The chart below explains how the stock has moved since Thursday:

ire it up into an interesting format for artists. As I tweeted in my debut article, the advertisement’s design, which was initially announced as being similar to a Pinterest clone, actually has more potential to be a way to make sure that artists aren’t over-expand'd by just taking their stock from their existing Facebook or Instagram albums and going straight online. It’s a great idea.
“For me there has been a lot of interesting stuff around commissioning your album’s image into an album cover on Facebook, and artists have been making their own album covers for a long time. But there’s always been a need to give youa chance as well,” he told me in an email this week.
He has gone back to the basics and is adding music to his album via a new feed app, for free, as a way to give artists on the social graph a way of finding new ways to share content, and make their own album covers relevant again. It is also interesting for artists, who can build on its visuality to create their own album artwork.
These two elements come in handy with the new Facebook photo album, as there’s an almost universal trend in today’s albums, according to the artist. In 2012, for example, Facebook launched an album in the UK government’s national gov involuntary cybersmography campaign – which was in fact created by an artist’s friend, which is in itself also a Facebook album. The artist involved has been asked to explain any connection with Facebook in a message the government’says it can send to citizens about the new album – but declined to comment, according to a report from the Reuters.

In the absence of a Facebook album, artist Facebook albums don’t often sell – and are unlikely to ever have a shelf life like the social network’s. So as Facebook moves to develop its own artwork, it will be competing with the likes of Spotify and Apple’s iTunes in terms how artists can share in an immersive, non-digital context. Those who create albums will be able to make money via ad-hoc and paid placements, and they will exist only for a while, but it could ultimately be the new album we see most on Facebook’s mobile service for iOS and Android devices has the possibility to become even more important.
“We think that the more time our users spend on the web album, they get more excited about the creative opportunities available to them within the Facebook app,” adds Muhjalal. “The app’s experience has evolved to make it a natural partner to play with and expand the Facebook experience, in terms of album creation and sharing. All in all, a great project from the artists to build a great album for their fans – as well as the app itself.”"
"A mobile app called Siri that has been downloaded by users in more than a dozen countries has been banned from Google Play stores in many countries. The app, which has already been the top app on Google Play since its release last week, has been updated and is now being updated to better analytics on iOS devices, Android devices, and the web.
The company, which is based in Israel, has now raised around $6 million, with the majority of the funds coming from Israeli startup Mutterworks, and an additional $10 million from Dror Rahal, founder of Socialgraph.org, according to his entrepreneurship and involvement with the company. The startup’s technology enables social news feed apps that include feeds from friends and Pages.
It’s similar to Facebook’s News Feed feed, but instead of focusing on the top-page of your news feed, the app focuses on people and stories from your interests and networks, like photos taken you by yourself at a coffee shop, or movies you’ve seen, like Iron Man, or TV, like a game or show like Game of Thrones. Those users can also add feeds from groups that already know you personally, such as your Facebook group.
Siri uses a lot of social data, but it’s not as reliable and detailed for everyone, nor as extensive. For example, Facebook’s feeds are very sparse, not unlike the ones you’ve already set up on other services like Twitter. The data it’s mining from your feeds may not be as comprehensive as what it’s building out its apps on Android devices for Google’s apps store, and it’s very unclear

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 in all of the major carriers for now on the iPhone, the HTC smartphone has been a hit, thanks to the HTC One M7, while the Samsung Galaxy S III IV has been an upgrade. However, the new HTC Desire Eye, which was launched in February with a price-point that included the HTC One M8, isn’t in the running for a third launch at this time — it needs to rely on its marketing and distribution efforts as well as make itself available in stores and on the web. It’s a big win for HTC, which is looking to move to a new consumer market, and at this point looking to become a hardware powerhouse. HTC’s marketing effort is certainly beginning to attract attention — from the likes of VentureBeat and Venture Pics, to its recent ad in the New York Times to the company’s recently launched video from Parks & Recreation with HTC founder, Larry Page, and company chief marketing officer, David Pao that goes right to the top in terms of its technical video of the One Motion app for iOS.
Even though Motorola is apparently looking at a price-wise Android alternative in the U.S., the company may need to make some significant compromises in design if it really wants to expand into the world of smartphones. Motorola may also be looking at a Motorola-branded OS designed by Google, Android Wear, which Android already supports. It also appears that Motorola is looking at other options, too. This may have a big effect on Verizon’s business, it seems, and the company, too, will need to see if and if it can find a way to differentiate the product."
"Lately, Facebook has seen another round of investment to come for Android, and this is another sign of the company becoming more flexible and growing more comfortable with its Android roots. FirstCloud Labs, the startup behind Android app discovery platform, has announced $35.5 million in an SEC filing from Google Ventures, with participation from existing investors, SoftTech VC, and Gartner.
FirstCloud Labs co-founder and chief executive officer Jason Zimdars said “We had an incredible track record as the founding investor of a very large investment site with one of the biggest communities in the mobile app universe. With our experience and the vast majority of our investors, we saw this technology as a long-term strategic investment. The team, as an ecosystem is extremely capable of growing the user base to 100 million mobile application installs.”
Zimdars said “Our goal is to create a mobile gaming community that drives game engagement and engagement on mobile devices. The firstCloud platform allows mobile developers the opportunity to provide more social experiences and interact with their users all from your mobile device.”
He added that the initial focus will be on the social mobile gaming world, but he’s planning on including games in future. A Facebook application is currently in the works. He also said some of the initial investors also are investors within the Facebook app marketplace network. 
The news follows a recent survey by New York-based startup Bright.io which found that more than 50 percent of consumers use smartphones to share content, but a whopping 60 percent use a connected mobile device to stay connected to the internet.
The idea behind the initiative is that people are more likely to use smart devices in the present day, but have “no memory or comprehension of the past” of the devices on the network. They are more likely to share their status updates and photos with friends, and to share them with those who have the smart device. Social social networking is going to have a huge impact on social networking, marketing and other consumer-facing areas in the future. Zimdars  said “Once they have the knowledge, they have the confidence and they can bring it to a wider audience and it’s easy to bring that to the enterprise and the education community and the student community.”
He added that “the next phase” for the company is going to be delivering tools and services to manage and monitor the social network from a business user, to a consumer.

"A major effort from Google to bolster its mapping and navigation services was announced at a presentation in San Francisco today, and it’s already doing that with partners. Google Map Maker, one of the partners for Google announced today, is using Android to build the software — and has been working with the company for 10 months.
The Google Map Maker software is a way to provide maps and navigation services to businesses, which may be Google’s most important growth market in the U.S. This is where Google will also be partnering with other software makers and companies.
The partnership will also provide a way for Google to build partnerships with mobile services companies like Motorola Mobility, Nokia Technology and Siemenschefonds.

 the market that the company wants to expand into. For example, today Snapchat launched a new ad product that’s aimed at advertisers, with the ability to place sponsored ads using Snapchat’s camera."
"The startup, which has raised $7 million in funding, recently added a new feature to create the ad inventory that can be shared through Facebook and Twitter.
While other companies, mostly advertising startups, have offered to integrate ad-related search results into its search engine and ad network, the company claims that AdRoller is unique in that it can create an array of ads and third-party content, but does so in a way that doesn’t necessarily require the need for a separate ad management program. To do so, AdRoller aggregates a number of pre-existing apps that let advertisers create and track campaigns related to their campaigns, including Facebook and Twitter, among others.
The ads are then distributed out via a web-powered portal where customers can subscribe to receive targeted campaign content. For example, an advertiser who has already paid for a campaign might want to use the new AdRoller ad to drive more traffic to her website, but only want to keep a small donation to her campaign alive.

AdRoller also plans to add a new advertising product to its platform, possibly as a way to provide additional information for advertisers such as the ad content that they are promoting.
With the addition of the new ad products, AdRoller will be looking at how it can work through partnerships and acquisitions to add value to marketers, like brands or companies who have already been successful with paid, in-house marketing content, and make their app more attractive to advertisers.
As AdRoller continues to expand its ad inventory and advertising networks, the goal is to provide a means to distribute advertising information to all stakeholders involved, including those consumers that have access to Facebook and AdRoller’s API, as well as the brands that have already begun to build their own social networking and ad campaigns following its launch and its expansion into the United States.
As AdRoller continues to expand, it is working with a number of ad networks that have been active in the space already, with the most recently-announced deal with Google Ventures and the Facebook Group. In addition to the APIs, AdRoller also operates a number of other partnerships, including those with leading mobile ad networks, like mobile.com, Pelion, MobilemarkerLab, Bounce, and Viacom, as well as others."
"For those who love to buy stuff from brick-and-mortar stores by the truck side, it’s a little annoying. Even if it does end up costing you a little, that’s the experience in San Francisco.
With a startup called AdRoller, you are treated to a smart, modern, connected gadget that can help.
The AdRoller hardware looks like something of a smart-home electronics system. There are several sensors for collecting information on your every move and the ability to send a push notification to your friends if you want to be alerted. The system is built to be a little like a smart thermostat, so for example, when you have a little cup of coffee on your face, AdRoller will send you that cute robot-sized greeting.

The AdRoller product is made by three entrepreneurs from the Bay Area, including co-founder and CFO Dan Tashnick and co-founder and CEO Jonathan Bower. The team has been working with local manufacturers to make these products, and it now has around 20 employees working on a new product that gives merchants an additional boost. The AdRoller smart home appliance runs $100 in total and it will include a lot of battery-saving software.

With the new appliance, AdRoller will give merchants full access to a data-rich platform, like a smart TV, with the ability to get help from a team of human experts, and to manage the installation, maintenance and repairs of the appliance. AdRoller will make money off the merchant side of things and there will be a lot of data on the sensor side of things.
This is where the co-founder Tashnick sees the future. He believes that the tech ecosystem in the U.S. needs to learn to operate in the real world and that this is something that you can learn a lot from the Japanese tech industry. That’s precisely what he wants to do with his startup.
Now, AdRoller is available on a subscription basis, but plans are in the works because AdRoller plans to get into the smart home electronics market, Tashnick says.
AdRoller can connect with AdRoller’s users 24/7 to give them a set of services — but first, AdRoller will have to have its own home automation system for smart home. This will require an additional $10/month for a single

:” said Eileen Burbidge, founder and CEO of the group. “They need a place where they can feel safe. They really need a place where they can feel confident to be out and about and be productive.”
The site says it has 700,000 people registered – although it seems there are actually 600,000 registered users, Burbidge and the group reckon. (A further breakdown we’re told is that it has “well over 150,000” registered users.)
Burbidge says the reason for the disparity is that the main reason for its low traffic is that people don’t know or care about the site. “They either think it is the same as they are used to thinking about social networking sites, or they think it’s just their job,” he said. “That’s the issue for people, for Facebook, we have all those different products.”
Indeed, Burbidge says that the group is “very much, very much, focused on women.”
The team will be using the money raised from its bootstrapped status to expand into more European markets, as well as expand into more major markets like Australia.
“We are doing everything that would have been hard for us to do back in 2011.”"
"Today’s Apple TV announcement has come, and we were only a few minutes in. Like last time Apple TV news, it was filled with new video announcements, but instead of using the same old formula, the company seems to have taken an interesting and risky route with a streaming box that runs like a cloud that runs to the cloud, including the cloud version of a cable box.
The company spent years as an experiment in experimentation, from being the first to build its own hardware to the new Apple TV format in this new version. It had some early success, starting on in Europe with a very early adopter (VH1), and today we can call it a success. The company sold to an American company for $26 million at a valuation north of $1 billion, $16 million more than its initial $15 million round.
This new round of funding was led by K2 Ventures, with participation from Maven Ventures, Maven Ventures, Maven Ventures’ COO and Dmitry Yak leader Jeff Hughes, among other things. The K2 investment is $2.2 million, K2’s Peter Jovanoff, the Maven founder, and the CEO of Maven Ventures, among others. At K2, K2 is backing the first European delivery truck to arrive at Apple TV’s offices in Los Angeles in the afternoon hours.
“In the midst of building a successful and sustainable business in Western Europe, the company has also proven with its previous experiences with its customer service and delivery drivers that the demand for Apple TV is strong and consumers are deliverable with significant volume,” he said in a statement.
The company had been in talks for a long time. That’s a great start.

"Apple’s biggest shareholder with a stake in the company is the investment arm that also owns another company, so there are rumors of another tech firm getting involved on these financial boards. 
The Wall Street Journal reports that the companies have been working together since Apple’s $6.85 earnings showing last quarter. While rumors have abounded, most sources say it has to do with Apple’s growing need for more liquidity and cash.
A source says that Apple is looking at ways of raising cash, specifically around its debt and cash situation.
In addition to that report, the Wall Street Journal reports new details around some of the details surrounding Apple’s deal with the hedge fund. There are also comments made about the hedge fund and the potential conflict with what is a relatively straightforward deal, while there are comments made around the potential issues of the deal.
It’s a pretty fair report for it that the hedge fund, which has a board seat of 2,500, is investing money. The firm actually provides capital funding for Apple. It is an Apple employee fund.
According to the Wall Street Journal, the firm is investing $15 million from two funds — the investment arm of a hedge fund, and the company. They also say that it is using some of its existing money.
The most recent point made the most sense. As the WSJ says, a good deal is something that a long time player like hedge funds have decided to put in. It’s not a bad move but it’s no sign of a major problem either for the company or hedge funds, which have invested at the highest rate in Apple’s most recent $12.3 billion deal.  The report doesn�

 but in order to help customers get the job done quicker for them.
The team uses a “microservice engine” to improve order fulfillment and supply, and an end-to-end approach to marketing to bring back the customer as fast as possible. So far, the team has processed 10,000 orders, and they have taken it to the heart of the company and started building a product to meet the needs of the customers that they’re trying to serve.
“What we’re doing is changing the way a company works in the world,” said Echo Maki, co-founder of Oatlogic. “Companies traditionally have gone about this as it’s been for the company for generations, so they have a single resource to find, hire, and retain best-of-breed engineers.”

Maki said companies have to ask for a lot of things to be done quickly. “We’re doing that in a manner that is efficient,” he said. “It’s important to us to keep making things as simple as possible.”
The team has also started with a handful of customer and partner customers, and they’ve grown to four product managers with an average of seven years of experience apiece.
“We don’t think we’re good enough for everybody,” Maki continued. “If you’re going to be a CEO or head of a company, you need to know how to hire the best people and how to really make yourself indispensable.”

If you have to make people more efficient with your product, you should have done it already. But to start, you’ve got to make people smarter with it. That starts with what you’re doing with the product itself, and even though your goal is to get to a product that is useful for everybody, how that’s going to be effective, he said. There’s a lot you can do if you understand the business and the business value.”
“If you think about the customer, they spend a lot of time in their mind. They don’t want to just be using their product to solve a problem,” he added, “but you just want to make them use it to solve that problem. You’re doing away with that mindset.”
“As you’re able to make people smarter with it, and you are able to understand what’s what they want, you’re going to give the customer that better sense of what they need,” he added. That includes trying to answer that customer’s customer support questions, and then how that helps create a better product, he added.
“It’s important for the startup to have a focus,” said Maki. “How do you sell with that?"
"Sensory, a device that monitors temperature in a room, has a new line of engineering software. The aim is to “help marketers push content to people in the room?” according to SPC.
Sensory CEO Jonathan Weil tells me that while the company has had a number of customers before, there were always a handful of them, and that number was always growing and getting even bigger. Now, it has around 50,000 companies on its platform in 24 countries, with more than 5,000 customers. That’s “bigger than the big data startups,” he added.
In the latest software update, it will now automatically know when you’re in your room, instead of just checking your smartphone. That’s a big change, but also a big value-add for SPC, which has seen its market cap rise to $1.8 billion.

Meanwhile, to build out that ecosystem and expand into new territory, SPC has also hired some new experts who will help it figure out what’s going on in the room. It’s also bracing itself for being a hardware product.
“Hardware, like hardware, is very much about making change and taking risks,” Weil said. “Hardware is very much more of an ecosystem than software – there’s ecosystem for hardware, there’s also software to integrate with it, and there’s hardware for a customer to own the hardware.”

That’s why there’s still focus on changing how the product is used, as well. Sensory can track both what and what in the room (not to mention other non-standard uses of its hardware), and it can tell you which are the “more important” temperatures (for example, he said that the temperature of the room should start off a different temperature than the bathroom temperature).

 included this year."
"We’ll never make Facebook the dominant source of political advertising, but I’ve seen some other startups try to capitalize on the social network’s success with political campaigns. One of them is Civic, a London-based startup that’s today announcing that it has been acquired by the Conservative Party for $3.2 million.
The deal means that Conservative officials will be using Civic’s data for their own political campaigns.
Civic’s technology, which it’s now calling “Civic Analytics,” will be used to make a number of political ads. The company has already been conducting a political ad campaign in London, with ads based near the London Olympics. However, these would be more than just campaign ads. They could also include endorsements by politicians in ads aimed at potential voters.
Civic’s technology had already been used for more than 70 political campaigns, including by the Conservative Party’s campaign manager, the party’s communications chief, and communications at the Prime Minister’s office, among others, notes co-founder and Chief Information Officer Paul MacKinnon. (Civic’s ads were for the 2010 General Election’s election. It was run with the help of the local marketing company Inreach.)
To find out whether Tory officials would use Civic’s data for campaigns (i.e. whether it’s possible to ask whether they have used it), I reached out to Civic’s CMO, the company did not disclose. But I did get to talk to MacKinnon, who said there had been “no plans” to use the data.
Speaking of the data, it was released by the Tory party today with a statement on the news of the acquisition (emphasis mine):
“We do not intend to share the details of this transaction with you, and we look forward to helping make future campaigns more enjoyable and memorable.”
MacKinnon added that Civic will focus on what he called “public market partnerships” (which have already included the launch of the British Football Association’s Facebook page in support of the London 2011 events), as well as public/private partnerships.
He continued, however, that the company will work with the Conservative party “as they scale the platform” (which already has more than 15 million registered accounts) with an overall audience of “almost 80 million” voters.
The company also says that it has a number of existing partnerships with the Conservatives (such as providing data for the party’s political advertising). At the same time, the company is making two new, free tools, which MacKinnon referred to as the Conservative Data Portal and the Conservative Data Portal, designed to help the Conservatives increase their social media presence, particularly in relation to the general election."
"Facebook has acquired the Israeli startup that makes a video editing tool called Viber.
Co-founder and CEO Adam Dittman, who stepped down from the company earlier this year, said in an interview on stage at the Web Summit that Viber, a video calling app which lets users edit videos, has had “an amazing run” thus far.
“We think Viber really is the leader in mobile video technology,” Dittman told the audience yesterday. “They have the kind of data and the ability to use it in a really compelling way and we think there’s room for Viber to grow.”
The Viber apps don’t offer much in the way of technical features, but they do have a great user experience’s experience and a compelling market of users. Plus, Viber now boasts 1.5 million registered users for its community video editing tool. These people had to be using an iPhone, but there are plenty of Android and Web applications to consider.
“Now, that’s the only thing that’s missing,” Dittman said. “If you talk to your friends who use Viber and they use Photoshop, they have great tools in Photoshop. Facebook is missing that kind of creative platform.”"
"Facebook won’t be able to monetize Facebook Video. And yet. Today, the company made the announcement that it can offer ads, but it can’t monetize live video streams.
In a video tutorial that it announced yesterday, Facebook said it wouldn’t be able to monetize live Video in Facebook, but that it might start to show sponsored content in Facebook-owned videos coming up on February. This is a pretty obvious move by Facebook, which has long offered ads to popular streamers like the Vine video-sharing app (which Facebook recently shut down), as well the video embedding service Vine.

 answer.
It’s not like your credit or debit card is holding up when you try to pay for a store’s order, it’s just that you cannot use your own credit or debit card for the balance.
“It’s a card in your wallet,” says Ong, who is based in London. “One of the reasons we’ve been experimenting with this is that the payments of money on the Internet are now much more difficult to integrate than on the phone. What we’ve been able to help us in this is to have a solution that’s really easy to use…to actually act as a payment device.”
It’s easy enough to get out of your wallet, which in some cases can be a lot smaller than your body, but also easy to get in, thanks to a simple two-directional QR code.
“Because of the way we’re working, for now we’re not creating a picture of people in that particular store so it takes a bit more effort on your part and it’s also much more precise,” he adds.
At the same time the payments solution is more user friendly. In order to do some of the necessary back-of-the-napkin integrations, for example, the payments solution also asks for a simple photo with some of the details on it.
After that, it’s just a matter of taking a photo and adding some details, and you can then use that to unlock your account and confirm your purchase.
“We’re doing the work of the store and they’re doing the work of the customers on the backend. They’re already processing a lot of transactions so once we’ve done that we’ve made a lot of progress,” says Ong when asked about the level of trust that payments will have. He also says these integrations to date have been “very rapid.”
In the meantime, in the meantime you can continue to look at the menu of things you might already know about Amazon. It includes everything from items like Amazon-owned electronics like tablets and phones to more traditional products from a range of retailers. You’ve even got more categories in the store. And if you want to shop the full selection of products in that shop, you’re more likely to have one of a larger range of products on the store’s list.
“We’re not going to push too far ahead because we’re not working with Amazon anymore. We’re just working with them and doing things where we want to be doing things.”
And there was also this interesting comment from a customer service e-commerce firm called Amazon, which responded via text message to a customer’s complaint about the integration process by telling them to “reconsider not using your credit or debit card anymore, we’ll cancel your order.”
It’s a good sign for Amazon on that, in a way, that it can work out that using its own payment solution, you can make a payment without your credit or debit card ever stopping functioning. This may seem trivial, but it’s an important development nonetheless: one that may not be quite as easy as some of the other approaches that have popped up in the past.
It’s worth noting that the real point of PaybyPass is not an easy one. Some people like to use an idea to pay for stuff that they don’t have on the Internet, but that’s difficult to do as the idea of PayPal (pay it) has been around for a long time. And PayPal’s system itself is far from perfect.
It’s far from perfect, but it’s no PayPal. And even PayPal itself makes for a different problem, since PayPal makes the product far and away easier to use than a debit or credit card. PaybyPass is also far more simple. It’s not a product you typically buy to pay at the store, it’s an idea that you use on the phone to do things.
Ong says the product is initially aimed at the United States, but the U.K. market is on the back burner.
“We’re going to focus our energies a lot on the U.S. market. We’re going to find new market,” he says.
You can find PaybyPass on the store’s website."

 the company told us in May 2012 that it saw its revenue rise from $9.8 million in May 2011 to $10.3 million in June. Its revenue grew a whopping 63% in one year, and then again nearly 70% in the following three years.
As a reminder, that means it now generates over-performing results in the range of 2 to 3 times. It did $2 million in gross merchandise volume, and $9 million in net, on revenues of $8.1 million.

"A week ago, I went to lunch with two guys who seemed to be pretty popular at tech conferences and they were arguing a lot about some new application of statistics. For those of us who write for a living, it’s pretty easy to see.
But for an entrepreneur or entrepreneur-in-residence, the conversation could not be more complex.
That is, there is a lot of people trying to talk about “statistically accurate” analysis. The result, many entrepreneurs say, often takes three, four, many phone calls.  It’s a frustrating interaction, especially as I’m used to startups running multiple rounds.
Some of this conversation was about a new app called Boomerang, which I wrote about last month and talked about on multiple occasions. So why is there still so much friction in the startup ecosystem? Well, as of today, there are still several misconceptions about the app.
I have already written quite a bit about the Boomerang founders, here and here are a couple of more:
So while we are talking about a single app, the other things you might think we are talking about are related to analyzing data. In other words, the conversations about Boomerang are about the way the company was created, the way it was spun off and the role it played throughout its short life.
As a result, I wanted to get into this discussion with Boomerang founders. Specifically, I wanted to ask about the design of Boomerang. And, if you’re not familiar with the concept, Boomerang is a new application that takes the idea of the popularizer and uses it to create more precise data.
I wanted to ask Boomerang founder Matt O’Connell a few things about himself.  First, he said there was a lot of work that went into Boomerang before the app went live. After that, Boomerang’s design was based on an idea O’Connell’s friends had before. Boomerang, they thought, would solve a number of problems.
It came down to the fact that Boomerang had a lot of limitations, as the app wasn’t meant to provide the stats of the entire team. O�Connell said “that’s pretty smart as you go, and it’s still a work in progress.”  O’Connell added that he didn’t want to talk about this app because he didn’t want to create a negative profile of himself, which may as well be true.  After all, why go hard on a PR campaign when you don’t have the team in the room telling you that you have the best product ever, and no one is complaining about you yet?
He also said he was interested to hear that the founders got back together to discuss the app, the team and what else went into Boomerang. O�Connell said that these conversations were always reproductive and that he could always see himself working with Boomerang.
Boomerang has a strong and active design. It was developed in just a few months. O�Connell said he started with the prototype in order for the team to see how they could iterate quickly. And he said that he saw the team working more quickly than he thought the initial design would support.
As for the startup’s new software framework, it does require some work. The developer sees a lot of bugs along the way. O�Connell said it’s a pretty challenging development as the Android environment is pretty sturdy. On one end, he had some compatibility with Android’s system, but he also had some problems with the layout.
He also argued that people should actually go beyond using Boomerang. If everyone had access to apps, they’d eventually see how good they can be. This would give programmers the confidence to learn the new programming language, which is actually much harder than they think it is.
O�Connell also argued that developers don’t need to have a background on statistics to use the app. What matters is the validity and precision of the technology. One example he gave was an email application that he was using and which he

 but their first big product launch, as well as all the new opportunities. That’s good news for the startup and will likely be good for the business as well.
The question for everyone is how big will this thing be?

"The company behind Fido, the popular Twitter social app acquired last week by Facebook for $1.5 billion, today revealed that FB and PayPal have signed a deal to integrate the startup’s real-time data marketplace into Facebook Messenger. Today, users who’ve used Fido’s messaging platform and have activated it through Messenger’s chat will now be able to view messages in the chat window and, presumably, send them to each other.
The partnership also includes the launch of FB Messenger integration with the Fido Platform to let you message users directly to let them know you want to chat. That will make it easier for Facebook to show users with messages that may already be in a thread in Messenger.
This is particularly important for Messenger since it’s now offering chat to Twitter, which today offers text-based messaging to Facebook as the first option. For many years, the messaging space is closed, yet Twitter has managed to build a massive presence in that space and users can be more proactive about the messages they follow. So you might send a message to a follower in chat to let that person know that you want to chat, or vice versa, but, until you’ve sent your first text message in chat, you can’t chat with a friend. Facebook Messenger today still provides a realtime communication space to you. It can offer to send instant messages to chat partners you haven’t met, but can’t text you, for example. In contrast, if you’re chatting with someone, you can send instant messages and can respond to people in your chat.
As the CEO and co-founder of Snapchat (acquired by Twitter for $1.3 billion last year) Fred Wilson told me before that the only reason people don’t send text messages in chat is because it’s a privacy barrier. Messenger’s real time messaging allows Facebook to track, but for the first time, the app gives you a way to avoid that problem for your Fido chat.

The Fido cofounder said that Facebook Messenger will now include the Fido platform to let you send text messages directly to someone as well as other chat partners’ chats. This is likely a boon for Fido, since, as Facebook Messenger’s cofounder and CEO David Fischer admitted to me earlier today, “The message app itself is still a really large and difficult challenge.” He also highlighted the Messenger cofounder’s experience in messaging to other chat apps like WhatsApp and Signal, as well as WhatsApp users at Facebook.
For Facebook and Twitter users, the partnership means that you can now have a chat window in their Facebook Messenger app, and it works with both Facebook and PayPal. It’s an impressive extension to the app’s already-popular real-time messaging service that lets you send texts and images both to a specific recipient, and to the right as a shortcut for that person to respond to that message. Previously, you had to send a request with Messenger, which the cofounder also said was “not a huge pain”.
The message from today is not the only sign of a lot of interest in the messaging space for both Facebook and Twitter. Earlier this year the two services announced a new collaboration on WhatsApp and signed a partnership to let you send texts and images between the two’s services as part of a new chat product called Message. WhatsApp had already offered the SMS option of sending text messages to WhatsApp contacts, while Signal had a much more straightforward chat product called Signal.
While this is a much more direct route to the problem of messaging to Facebook, the cofounder said his team won’t be taking a position on where the Fido messaging app fits in. Instead, while it’s an impressive step forward as it represents Facebook’s effort to play a role in the messaging business, it’s important to note that the app’s real-time messaging doesn’t rely on SMS or WhatsApp and it’s not reliant on Fido in any way.

"The last time Facebook had a real-time messaging product came in July 2011, when it launched its chat product Timeline.
Since that launch, the company has been busy building out its Messenger product, which was released last November with much attention given to its

�’s a good idea.
Here’s my question about how this will work:
What if the other person says nothing? The first person, you say?
That’s a no-brainer. It gives you a better shot at getting your message across.
Would you really say you want your letter to go public?
I wouldn’t necessarily expect it to stay as the focus. If I write it to a company executive as part of our engagement, I’m probably better off knowing my email does well than knowing it doesn’t."
"This article is also being reprinted on the BBC at the close of the Weekend magazine cover story. That news also touches on another area that we see all the time. Business executives have the right idea how to manage a startup: make it to market as quickly as possible. The other person, meanwhile, has his hands cleared up on what to do once they get to market.
And by some measures this is true: CEO and founder Travis Kalanick won’t be in the news for another few minutes. And he doesn’t need to be. His first question for me was when they should say yes to a raise because the other company did get it. After all, you don’t say a company is going to be out of business because you didn’t pay to close the deal (though if you were a CEO in the U.S., they might do it.)
But I was also questioning Kalanick, who wants his company to be a success despite the failures on its previous round. It didn’t go like it, that’s why he got the job.
The other question that Kalanick asked for the interview was how far ahead of the initial plans they had for the company. The answer was how far ahead that Kalanick wanted the initial conversations, and they were pretty far off from each other. When he was at the launch of the company it was at a conference in Boston. He wanted to get through that initial process, and was really surprised to discover how much that was already shaping up; he was going to have to be very much in it from the beginning when it was started, the company was going to have to get out of it. All the other questions that were asked about a couple of hours before the interview were also pretty obvious how far out they had already made up their thinking on the project.

And even more telling, Kalanick didn’t care a bit about the answers that he was getting in this interview. He wanted one true answer to that first question, whether he liked what he was doing, and he wanted the answers to the “Next question” on that second question as well.
“I think about the past and the future,” he told me. “That’s what you see when you come back to it: The answers, both, are the same.” So there’s not even a conscious thought going on in his head, but he’st just looking for the answers.
That’s what separates Kalanick from his team. It’s not like they say, “Go ahead,” and, “Right, let’s just focus on the next question”. They say, “We want you to really know the answers and we want you to be absolutely 100 percent focused on the answers, because you never know – even in the very best companies – you never know when you ask the questions how many questions you are going to get when you ask questions. I think that the other team members do that when they ask questions they are really more concerned with the answers.
How far ahead of the first plans the company had for it, was that enough to get its first round?"
"It took Google for the last few days to get people’s attention on its news page, and now they won’t be again. Thanks for getting our readers onboarded, we’re sure it will help you and your team stay tuned."
"The European Commission and Twitter today announced that they’re going to close a joint investigation into the social network’s role in the banking scandal with the French bank HBH by way of the European Banking Inspection Authority.
The ECB decided to bring its investigation to bear on Twitter today after the US regulator came to see about the Twitter coverage surrounding the banking scandal.
On Saturday, the ECB posted an opinion piece on CNBC, addressing the questions around the banking investigation by saying:
According to the report, Twitter was already facing an investigation into the role of its employees, as well as the broader issues with its reputation standards.
At the time of the announcement, the ECB highlighted the “overly-covered” and “extensive” issue at its own. It went on and on

.
We have to talk about that in a bit. You’re probably thinking, “Why not give me more tools to play with?” In the case that people will give you their money… We’ve seen plenty of companies in the last week that give back to their community… I think all of the startups that don’t. A good company can provide a tool, but one that can make a big difference, and they have to really give something.
“We have to prove,””
“Give me a try.”
If you don’t have a solution, give me a try, but don’t give him a raise. But be ready if he’s giving you $75K on the phone: “I know how much it cost to pay for, but I don’t care about that. Give me a try.” 
He could not sign a deal if he tried to because he’s an entrepreneur and a founder and he’s a very big and bold entrepreneur that’s why you have that deal: if he’s giving you another deal, he’s taking $50k from you. I don’t think he’s going to give up his investment.
“It doesn’t hurt to see the way we work in Silicon Valley”
For the same reason that it doesn’t hurt to see him, the company could make a deal that lets one company become dominant in a certain space and you stay. If you’re in the market, you get bigger in front of customers, and that means if you have an idea about a product that people like, and you can do a good product, people start doing a better deal, and that means you have a better chance that they’ll pay.
He’s the biggest entrepreneur you’ve met, or your best-friend, or your biggest investor. A lot of entrepreneurs, or even investors, don’t realize how much of a product the business is built around, yet the startup has to prove that product is working, and in order to grow, that’s just not an easy thing to do. We can’t guarantee you won’t start at a small company that does not have the capital; you can need the capital to grow the business on both coasts.
And the other part to understand, or if you have an idea where you think you should have a bigger business, there’s other things to be known, that could also make a deal. So that’s why you’re paying for a larger company. So that’s why when the startup is going big, the product and the company will be together for the long haul. As to why you might not pay for a larger company, just know that one size doesn’t necessarily equal a product or a customer. If there is one company that is going to win the game for you, be like “fuck it” and keep going small. Just try to be smart.
Finally, keep in mind that some of the founders who can’t keep up with the product and the service will not be happy if it doesn’t make them money. It’s not easy to keep up with that kind of money, so understand what you want, and keep going that way.
“It’s a pretty big game.”
Some of the companies are going to lose partners, but don’t give up on making it as easy as possible to buy the product. It will happen. It will happen for the most part. We are not going to lose our partners. As long as I can’t see a competitor right now, I will have to think about how to make that bigger business run and I may want to build it, but we have to make it clear when we build, so that it’s not really a competitor. The other part of that is, the biggest deal is going to take the company a lot longer to do this, so if it does work out for the business to the way I want it to work out, it will have to be on the company’s side, even if I do that.
Don’t be afraid to do that right off the bat: If you work for a larger company, you will become a bigger player than you need to be to stay relevant. It is a huge commitment. If you have a great product and the customer service is on point, and I don’t see a competitor, it will be in the business. If it is in that business and you want it to be that way, it has to continue to grow, and then I have to bring the company

 2000 on.
Here’s another interesting fact.
We are still a long way from any actual consumer electronic products. The first product from Zebra Technologies — the makers of the Zebra iQiq — was released in August of 1991. We don’t have any real electronic products to speak of yet. But we have some interesting bits of information from the company that prove there is still a huge need. These could be some very interesting information for Zebra."
"The second-biggest U.S. search engine has its sights set on breaking into the world of e-commerce with a mobile business called NexGenius. The company, which first started by being a web search engine, has now launched on mobile — specifically into the mobile app platform  that Google is trying to build in a bid to get its inroads into the mobile shopping marketplace as an even bigger contender.
At first glance the mobile site looks identical to its mobile counterpart, complete with social network features and a “Buy Now” button, which users should be turning off after a specified period of time. This is down to the fact that we now use smartphone and tablet screens as the primary platform for most of our online lives.
“We are focused on the very essential stuff that all of us are looking for right now,” said CEO, Chris Sullivan (pictured top left in his white shirt), speaking to TechCrunch in an interview. “The search industry is pretty saturated, there’s no doubt about the fact that. We believe there’s a lot of opportunity for us to disrupt the whole mobile shopping market and take the mobile industry to another level and transform the mobile shopping market, which is something we’re planning to do going forward.”
Today’s announcement today marks the company’s first real-time mobile effort. It’s actually been sitting within the confines of a search site for a while, building up what is essentially a small mobile presence around its core business, and building an awareness of the fact that what it does on mobile is quite different from what it does on web.
“When we launched in April of last year, one of what we found particularly fascinating about it is how we’ve broken the market and have had people searching across different continents,” Sullivan said. “Our biggest concern is that, of course right now you still have to search the U.S. so we’re continuing to go direct to a mobile version of that service.”
But not to this extent. The first two weeks have been dedicated to the mobile launch efforts. That is about getting a foothold in a new and increasingly fragmented sector of the market, and on mobile a way to build a database of that mobile. At this point the company is adding a number of features and services such as its own search engine to that mobile search — that is about taking its mobile upmarket mobile offering to the next step. And as part of this, the company is also working on adding new features aimed at the international markets too.
“We want very much to build a ‘Mobile Shopping’ business and to really make sure we can grow that business as quickly and as quickly,” said Sullivan, when we asked whether he’s looking to add more international markets.
“I haven’t settled on those specific plans yet but we know that in the future, we’ll be able to do that more, as well. So we don’t need to do any further announcements on those front. But obviously the search engine is something we’re going to continue to focus on — so I don’t have any surprises to the users. This is where the focus of our strategy is going but I do believe all the platforms do serve something useful, so we’ll be continuing to focus on the mobile side of things moving forward,” he added.
The other part this is about getting the mobile site to a point where it’s more of a platform with realtime features to work around its core business. So by putting mobile at the forefront of Search’s launch plan, it’s looking to drive the other search operators to do the same, in order to get up and running with search services, something which Sullivan said it was one of the main reasons why Google’s plans to enter e-commerce this year also came out of the blue.
“The fact that people want the ability to search through a very rich catalogue of online content was something we wanted to be able to offer to users,” added Sullivan. “We wanted to go one step further. So what we’re hoping to achieve now is where we can bring to mobile users more content. And also how to make use of mobile for things they don’t rely on their

“We believe that an app that is good for your phone should also be good for your mind,” says Zhang. “It is not a one-size-fits product.” If something you’re excited about is not something you want to give up, an app developer has to do everything it can to help them get there. They need to take every opportunity and ask themselves ‘How can this change my life?’
Of course to start a new, a developer simply has to answer a simple question. How can an app make me more productive?
The first question Zhang asks himself is how to use this great, innovative app to improve our own productivity and productivity level? While there’s a plethora of productivity apps out there, there’s an influency in this question, and a huge variety of tools that will help a developer solve it.
“Many of the ideas come from science. How can we solve these problems and how do we do that within the app for me?” says Zhang of the ideas he wants to use to solve the productivity issue facing a new generation of software, and eventually the entire entire world.
The next question Zhang has to ask himself is how can I find it, and will that app be more useful and more efficient than what I already use?
The answer: a single keyword. Why do we want to make it so hard? Because the real power of this app, according to Zhang, is the amount of information it delivers.
“What I think will be the biggest shift the world has seen over the course of the last century,” says Zhang. “It is the concept of the ‘open web. We want to open the web by making it really easy for developers to add new applications.’ This will be the big shift of the next generation of software, and the beginning of a whole new age for software.”

The next question will be “How do we make something useful?” Again, because the answer, according to Zhang, is the same, it’s just a single, specific keyword.
“We’re going to be able to do all of that for the iPhone and Android and Kindle Fire now. It is very exciting,” Zhang adds.
Once the app you have choose to use for the new software age, a developer wants to make a conscious decision to be ‘user first, developer follow’. “They don’t want to put the user first and rely on their service’s or use cases to get the first one job. They want to build something that works for everyone.” Zhang says that developers need to think “platform first, developer follow.”
Here’s a sample application for iOS that Zhang and his co-founders, the pair have also built with their original funds in mind: A task management app for the iPhone that lets you track your tasks and their progress in real time. How does it work? You’d download and install the App Store and set it on your phone or a tablet. It will connect to your computer.
The only thing you have to do is click the ‘add tasks to list’ button.

On first glance, you look at the screen and notice the big list of tasks right before your eyes. If you’ve got multiple tasks on your to-do list, those items are grouped together in a list. You swipe to the right (or up, if you swipe to the left.) to add more tasks without opening a new window all the time.
If you want to create multiple tasks to do one thing, instead of creating dozens of them, you click the green arrow to add an action so that you only have one action open.
At the moment there are two actions, one for posting tasks to your Facebook in order to get it through to your friends and a follow-along for posting reminders to your friends.

As a developer, Zhang says he’s found it more and more useful to be able to “do something” and let it be ‘done’ in real-time. “Imagine this.” if someone asked him, “how much do you need _____ to do for me today?”   Instead of a task asking you to do more work, Zhang suggested that something could do for the task: “Ask them to list the tasks they think I need done today for someone,” Zhang explained. “You could take some of their list of tasks and just list the ones you think that would do for them, which is something that you’d do if you’d wanted. Or you could go back and repeat

 perfect users with the feature, so users will have to get creative to get it, which could be harder with so many Facebook and other users out on the wild side.
I’ll tell you one thing. For all the cool kids online, Facebook doesn’t have anything on the web. It takes a few steps and doesn’t have the best image hosting, and it would be a hassle. So, if a friend posts something and you find a link, just hit up the word “dank’ in the comments, and you’re automatically published.”
If a few of your Facebook friends use it to make your photo disappear? Why was it blocked or why did the app suddenly freeze in that photo?
We are constantly trying to block apps on our servers. We don’t update their permissions after a very long time, so users will be able to find their apps and then disable them. We are careful how we update permissions for our servers. We have several layers of security like blocking accesses to all the server from all the browsers, removing the images, blocking the DNS, and so on.
Can a friend delete their photo before clicking through and seeing the image?
We are working hard to ensure that you can’t do that. Users have been known to delete their image before they are able to view it.
Can you tell how much time was spent on the servers?
We are not at the moment working on the server side in relation to the user experience. We are still working on Android. However, we have a long way to work on Android and iOS.
What would you do if Facebook deletes an image from the servers?
We would start with ‘this image is being deleted,’ and make the attempt to find it. Then we would make a hard request to the users directly, and if they don’t respond in less than a day, we’ll contact the developers and make a new request. If the situation is urgent, we can immediately take over the request and send a new one.”
Why are you going to let your users delete their images?
We have a different kind of technology, and in this case, the app is not accessible via this device.
Can you tell in real time how long your network has been blocked for, and how long you would let people access the site for now?
Unfortunately, it is a bit complicated to do on mobile devices. We have a blockage request, but there are several different problems. We are trying to do it right for all of our users who are not blocked by the request.
For example, we don’t allow our users to upload images from Flickr or G+ pages. There are some images from these pages that are getting posted on Twitter. We are also blocking the images on Flickr, but the blocking problem will be less common on Pinterest.

How many times are you on a site, and how many times have you been taken offline?
We are working on blocking our server for a couple of seconds, but it could be an hour or 40 minutes."

 its and their valuation have been steadily rising in the past few months. And now the acquisition is finalized.
The acquisition has been structured as a combination of cash and share purchase transactions, but will be carried on both sides. As to the financial details for the acquirer?
According to a post on the firm’s site, it has raised a total of $1 million in funding from existing investors and new investors in the last 12 months.
The startup will be folded in and sold to an equity partner, similar to the way private equity firm Perkins Capital has done with partners for its sale of assets to acquire companies with a multi-year sale plan.
That said, the company won’t continue as Google, which remains the only service for customers in Google’s native applications. It will operate as a separate business unit, with more than 25 global service providers. (They include Google, Group, Facebook and Facebook Messenger.)
The company isn’t a new investor to Google’s Google Apps, which has been around for some three to four years now (in our interview with Google, he didn’t get too deep in here). In fact, during the previous round, Google Apps got its first raise in cash, according to CFO Dennis Colvin, a former head of Google Apps.
In July 2014, Google said that it had just completed the last two years of revenue, which had been $1.4 billion. Now, Google Apps continues to operate at an even slower pace at $2.1 billion.
However, Google’s Google Apps growth has slowed in the last few months, according to the report. In the last quarter, Google says it reached 2.58 million customers, with revenue coming down to $965 million before making its first cash purchase of Google Apps. That suggests that Google is still trying to gain traction in areas like the advertising business. “This quarter, our quarterly revenue hit 2.52 million users, but this quarter we closed a $2 billion revenue run rate,'” Colvin notes in the report.
Google Apps is now coming to Google Apps, but the company doesn’t appear to have enough revenue to buy Google Apps, which is what it needs. “Google is still not producing enough revenue or monetizing properly,” notes Colvin. “Google is in the process of creating a new revenue-generating opportunity for Google-based products like Google Reader. As it becomes more difficult to monetize Google applications on mobile devices, Google Apps revenue has slowed down. Google is in the process of getting its Google Apps business working on mobile devices. We continue to see strong growth in Google applications revenues in our Google Apps services platform, and Google continues to have strong revenue growth in Google Maps. Google continues to build a platform for Google Apps across multiple platforms.”"
"If you have trouble paying your bills, chances are, the problem isn’t that much, as long as you’ve got something available to pay and it happens a little differently from one of your biggest pain-bearing headaches. A new startup called Minted is aiming to offer a small fee to its users for each purchase, and more specifically for card issuers by way of their card databases, along with a simple way to get ahold on your credit card info using a link to a PayPal receipt.
The concept, in plain English, is you get a fee for each transaction you make on Minted — the fee could be just a few dollars, or perhaps it could be a bit less steep (a 10% fee for the best customer, apparently). But since your debit card details are never put on a website, making a credit card payment via PayPal is the best way to get your money as quickly as possible.
“[Minted] is essentially a credit card that you can pay to any bank to deposit,” founder and CEO Andrew Bower notes. “We are the first credit card issuer to pay for every transaction.”
Minted is essentially a credit card-linked debit card service but with the added benefit that you have a PayPal receipt (or a PayPal deposit, if you’re using a prepaid card that is accepted by a credit card network like Visa or Discover), which lets you deposit money your way.
The site for Minted has a simple process, using a URL and a link to the company’s Mint.co.uk site, which lets users link to the card to their payment info. The service itself, however, doesn’t go to a website to get the users to link to Minted’s website, except they can click a link at the bottom center and enter their PayPal account to make an order.
The site is also being made available on the web, allowing you to pay via PayPal, a credit card reader or credit card issued from the credit card issuer, using your credit card details.

 service and to make sure there is sufficient coverage on the ground.
With the launch of a companion app on iOS this year, Tensor has created a better understanding of the way people live and work. Using apps like Tensor, you can connect with others in similar professions and share things to do or visit, including tips on cooking, for example.
Tensor has been working with a lot of different organizations, including the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, for example, in the last couple years for a project they call Connecting in the Mind.
It’s an interesting idea because there are so much more options for people to be around people and interact with them — even if it’s not connected up in some way — and that includes the need for things like Tensor. The Tensor app itself is a great idea, of course, considering how many of us, especially those in the digital age, are comfortable already connecting with each other. That’s not the case, however, for many of our connections.


There are so many ways I might use this, not the least of which would be to share advice about food, and to get others’ opinions on it.
Another would use it as a companion app for the iPhone — perhaps an entrepreneur, or a student in a graduate program, for example, for example.
But there’s more, too. These tools could actually make your job more interactive, too. It’s about having the ability to offer the kind of advice that can be offered from someone else, rather than just another source of information and insight into how you should apply your expertise to this field. That should make you feel more at home even if you’re not the expert in the field.
And if the startup’s plan is so to move forward, it has a better understanding of what people like themselves for as a way to become part of an existing movement. There’s also a lot more work to do on the app side of things, of course.
The company today had 5,500 signup users, and says that many of its users are members of those organizations who already have an iOS application.
For those who don’t yet, don’t worry about your current location — it’s all you’ll need to do when connecting with your colleagues, then.
Tensor can be downloaded here from the App Store."
"A few days before we bring that company to you, Giphy has announced the close of a $3 billion exit. As part of an additional funding round, the company has also further acqui-hired its European creators including Dmitry Yarivychenko, CEO Nikolai Yakovenin, and co-founder and investor Andrei Derevyuukyn.
These deals were announced back in April, but it’s a little bit of news today.
The round from investors including Index Ventures, Index Ventures, and Greycroft Partners, combined net loss of about $1 billion over the course of just over three years. As we reported in November, the company had already raised one round of outside money, but lost some of it as it went through various spin-ups.
I should clarify that Giphy was still actively marketing, and that it was still in the “investing phase” when it had its $500 million exit. The company says it was “still active with strategic operations in the traditional TV space.”
The final round means that Giphy has finally gone public — a milestone many thought it had achieved, after only taking $3 billion in equity financing over a 12-year history. That $3 billion exit (the Giphy 1) makes today’s $1 billion exit a milestone for the company.
The company will become one of the largest, largest and most popular creators of free-form “online-and-offline” TV shows worldwide, and so its loss of this funding (so far) is very much understandable.
I reached out to Dmitry Yarivyukyn, Giphy co-founder and CEO Niklas Låhmansson, the company’s head of international growth, and he said he knew the company had to focus on its “core business” for now — that involves developing its tool and services for producing the content that it produces: “That means creating our business (for the community too) and that is where we will be spending the most time for the next five years.”
He added that the company had made mistakes when it came to developing its product, but he insisted that the software “had been so good” that it was not “really a problem we needed.”
He argued that Giphy

 notion to be able to talk with one another about a topic without using their smartphones, and also work with other editors to get more information.
We saw an official prototype of the device, where we saw several editors from different media asking to use the app to talk to one another. Many of them were excited and asked to describe the things in more depth. One writer, who was studying history, was able to get into a few books by reading one of his favorite books, and asked us what it meant before and after World War II — that was a very interesting thing for me at our panel.
“The most wonderful thing about this device is that you don’t find the device itself on the device” said founder and CEO Robby Stein. “We want you to be able to be able to access it when you need it.
“There are two parts to this device — one that gives you access to content and content that is curated by our editors to create a meaningful conversation piece, and one that is curated by the editors within the app,” he added.
He and his co-founders — the two former editors at Conde Nast who have worked on topics like “The Daily” and “Hederman Mack Sennett” — began looking into how this device could be improved after taking apart the device. “One of the key things is they had discovered that when they put the device back together that was just a screwup,” he said. The team then took the device apart and built a new product, a prototype device, that’s still a little bit of a prototype, but it gives you a better sense today of a device that feels like the final version of it: The app is now a functioning prototype, with buttons to move around. “We are still thinking a lot” Stein said.
Another feature for the app is a navigation feature that will be available in the next couple of months, with a new set up for the iPad app. “That allows you to explore more content and content that is curated to you by our editors,” Stein added. “We want all of our content to be accessible,” he said.
“We just got to start the development process again,” he said. “I don’t want to get too much into specifics about how we’re getting to that point, but we’re now in the process of creating a set up.”
Stein would not provide more specifics about the company’s plans, nor would he want to talk about the potential market of the app — that depends on the funding that the startup is able to secure.
“We aren’t going to talk about specifics right now,” he said. “We’ll definitely look at revenue in the next 3+ years.”"
"We saw our little boy run around the apartment. We were so worried that he might be distracted, which he thankfully wasn’t.
We had to use the video camera. That made the whole experience more frustrating than ever. For the past couple of weeks, we’ve been in our studio apartment in NYC. And the camera was not working.
That’s why this is such a great holiday gift from me. He got it for us last night at the last possible Christmas Eve, which was when my mom started making the presents.
She brought him a little giftbook. That’s why I gave him a little note. I wrote him a little note: “Hey son, I got something for you for christmas. I want you to know that I like you more than you love. I know you had to make a new gift. I’ll help you.” It was then that we went back to our apartment to find the next big shipment.
So far we’ve gotten two gifts. The first was a box of toys. I have five of them with me and they are incredible. They are very cute pieces of art. The second was a big black bag. And a big gift from Aunt Lydia. She even went through the trouble of making something. I love the look on the bag.
There’s more on the way. I believe that we will get three gifts this year. We always send my mother a surprise. That’s why why this is more special.
We thank you for coming. We’ll see you tomorrow.
In other news, it looks like Apple is bringing out an Apple TV 4K set. I guess they knew exactly what they were looking to do, since you know exactly what I think of it. The set is going to launch in the fall, and there’s going to be a video on the Apple TV 4K."

 can the service handle for you.
There are currently 12,000 registered users at this point, but most of them come in through the site’s consumer portal and/or from private sources, like Facebook or Twitter subscriptions. While the service was built by a pair of Stanford-trained engineers, the company is not disclosing active users numbers or monthly active users, which Coryell says is just 10 percent of total users — though it is certainly growing fast (2,000 businesses are registered daily).

The company is currently building out its private, hosted community network with over 50,000 companies that have built out businesses using Coryell. While that may seem like a lot of users to have active users, Coryell tells us, only one percent of Coryell’s customer base come from those sources.
Since its launch in May, Coryell has seen over 9,000 developers build businesses using the service. At the time, Coryell also boasted that it could potentially be the only service in the world to do away with your personal data.
Coryell now has over 40,000 apps, with the startup recently making $100K in revenue per month. The company is also doubling or quadrupling user numbers every quarter, CORYell CEO Daniel Caryell says.
Coryell says that its current users include Fortune 100 companies like GE and the Bank of America. Other Coryell users are the likes of the National Basketball Association, which recently released its latest app, as well as the National Hockey League, which just released its latest edition of their app.
On Coryell’s roadmap for growth coming soon is a private developer network that allows companies to build their own branded experiences — to serve as something akin to the “GitHub of analytics.”
Coryell will be updating this post with updates to its roadmap, as well."
"Mobile ad company Daimler has some news for publishers interested in using the Daimler Mobile Media Hub and it looks like a pretty big win.
Daimler has been actively working to expand ad options to more carriers worldwide, and just this week it announced the acquisition of local ad company, Aktom.
According to Daimler Mobile Marketing Hub director, Jan Egerle, the two services will be integrated onto the Daimler Media Hub, the company’s next-generation mobile advertising solution.
“This is a major step to ensure that brands and publishers can reach the right customers at the right time,” Egerle said.
The move takes the first step in the company’s effort to build out an Android-based experience in markets where Android is already more prevalent than Apple’s mobile OS. That includes more aggressive, localized launches in areas like India where it’s been less successful than what the company had hoped for.
As the company’s global marketing and product manager, Ravi Narasimhan said, the company is confident this is the final piece of its strategy to deliver a unique, high-quality experience worldwide."
"Google and Facebook have been talking about this for quite some time, but now that we have some real-time information from TechCrunch and Daring, the two tech giants are getting official permission to speak. (Or at least Facebook, which has now agreed to share its location with its sister startup).
Today, Facebook will finally be allowing users to pay at the new Google+ paywalls, and there’s no fee. (The Facebook-paywalls launch starting today, at a $5/month charge.) So, no matter what, Facebook pays you at the Google+ app. The fee is a part of a new fee structure that allows Facebook to charge a fee to certain paywalls in certain countries, but not all).
If you ever had that deal, you’d make money. If you pay at mobile phones, in its mobile network, Facebook basically pays the same thing.
The idea is clear: Facebook pays for the ad time and the ads clicked, but nothing else. It’s a good deal and Google will be paying more to Google.
Google, on the other hand, does charge a $1/month fee for certain paywalls.
Daimler CEO Dietmar Wermelshaus told Der Spiegel that the deal won’t affect Google’s bottom line — that they would’t be able to charge Google’s app fee. Rather, it will help them provide free advertising for those regions.
“If you want to get into the app, you pay the first time,” he said. “There’s no charge, and it’s a good revenue deal. The other thing that goes on… That’s why every country, every market is special at its own way of

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
The Google News Reading Mode for the Galaxy S6 is probably the most interesting part of the device, so expect that to be a key consideration when it comes time for the flagship to ship. If Google goes for the same kind of content that the iPhone has offered over the years, it could become a big draw for a big part of its user base.

The S6 does have a small display, but the screen will probably be larger, and the battery has no real need for replacement at a low-cost. The camera has a few tricks for making a good high-speed camera, so there may be more tricks for a larger display, too. If these tricks prove to be effective, Google will have a lot more incentive to pull it in and make an even better camera that’s better for more high-quality content.
Samsung will probably end up looking elsewhere as well, and Google will either end up with a strong enough lead it will continue to do well for its budget-seeded device — which is less and less likely to fall under the umbrella of anything else, or the one that’s more likely to grow and build on.
The Nexus 7 was more like the Nexus 7: Google’s attempt to make Android a device that would compete in the price-sensitive smartphone market. But then Google gave it up to a competitor and ended up as a leader in one part of the Android ecosystem. Google needed to grow more quickly to get away with doing less and less cost with what the Nexus 7 was.
[iOS 6, Android 4.4.4 in: the Nexus 5, Nexus 4, Nexus 7]
Google’s Nexus 7 was a good device, and it is still one of the best smartphones on the market at best. However, it is also a very strong proof of the need for new Android flagship devices that can compete in the more expensive, premium smartphone segment. And Google knows that there are people who will pay $649 for a better device, so Google will have a lot more to offer."
"The Android Wear smartphone, the most promising to date device by Google at its pre-iCloud launch event this week, now has a software update with the HTC One, bringing Marshmallow software to the One. This update, codenamed, is a good candidate, given that Google had already released its Android Wear software with support for Android Wear, which has a Google-branded display, and a new, circular display unlike most of Google’s smartwatches.
Google released version 2.0 of its Android Wear Google Watch, at 1 Google I/O the company has said, in an effort to sell its first watch of the smartwatch category at the company’s I/O developer conference this week. Google also released a version for Android Wear, called the Google Smart Watch, at I/O this week.
All of which is very much a Google phenomenon.
Google announced a few notable updates to Android Wear, which it has applied to existing Google Nexus devices, including the Nexus 8, Nexus 9, Nexus 11 (to name a few), the Nexus 7, Nexus 3 and Nexus 4. But, to date, it has generally been an iterative approach, and one that has researced well to what appears to be Google’s desire to create a new ecosystem of Android devices.
Google also released the Android Wear SDK last week, as part of Google’s Android for Wear experience (if you’re still confused about just how much Android Wear actually has in common with the current version of Google’s OS), and in the Android Wear hardware development, Google revealed Google is considering a second, similar announcement to last year’s Android Wear Developer Kit, due in August.
That’s a very strong indication that Google is thinking about new Android Wear devices, and also points to Google possibly planning the full Android Wear Developer Platform, which is not limited to wearable gadgets. Google has, for example, announced some very specific apps that are specifically based on Google’s OS for developers. Google has even announced Google Android Wear, though, so there’s a reason to think about what type thereof apps Google might include in the Developer Platform, and what Android Wear devices or devices Google might decide to push out at the first I/O, this time around.
This is also very likely an update to Android Wear OS 2.0, the Android Wear developer hardware announcement, and Google’s new Android Wear software. However, Google has yet to announce what the Android Wear developer Android SDK will include, let alone release dates.
For Google to do so, Google would have to work to convince OEMs, OEMs and carriers alike to get their hands on phones that would make sense for the smartwatches. While Google already has some great Android Wear apps to show off, a lot of what they include is

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 through the last six months.””"
"If anyone out there in Europe wants to grow big, it’s a chance they’re going to get a kick in. European VC firm Europas has just released the next batch of European companies that have grown 50 companies or more or have raised more than €100 million from the European stock market. It has exclusively been made available to the public, starting with an announcement of the second group of startups in the city city of Brussels.
That’s an impressive set that represents the biggest European cohort I’ve ever had covering the heart of Europe.
The city is full of companies that are still in their infancy, and they often face the very challenging conditions. In addition, the European government is failing to create enough incentives and infrastructure to support European entrepreneurship in this industry.
This year, Belgium was hit with the largest single social investment settlement since 1994, yet these companies are the exceptions that prove the rule.
Europas believes that a generation of entrepreneurs in Brussels are better equipped to compete and win the competition.
But they might not be alone. The government has recently announced that the European Competition Commission has put new focus on the digital side of the business, particularly in areas like the social media, advertising and online distribution.
A look at Europas’ second group of startups shows that while they don’t have the European record record for the most recent record break, they are looking to change the way that businesses do business within these market segments.
These startups are starting a massive round of venture funding: €2.2 billion. The first investment round of this batch was €1 billion; and that was the only investment that Europas has ever done.
We have covered a group of startups in Brussels that have raised money under $50 million; a group that is raising a further amount of money from private investors; an online education platform; another that is targeting the financial services sector; and now another that is raising a larger amount; and another that is growing faster than the rest of the city at a comparable pace. I have no ideas why Europas won’t just stick itself with one.
These firms were founded almost 100 years ago and are working on the basis of the idea that traditional investors were going to give up more than €9 billion to these young startups. But for some of them, such was the cost to the investors (at least when you remember the days of the old days when you were buying an enterprise from a French bank, or an Irish bank).
For a company like Europas, these deals have huge benefits, not least of which are the sheer sizes of the capital pools across the various European cities. As one investor (who had invested through Europas in Léfin, Vodafone, U.S., and Europe) put it, “Europas has access to one of the biggest capital pools in Europe at any one time.”
Now that the money has finally been spent, most of the traditional investors are going to the exit window.
I don’t know the particulars of how the new investment will be used by the startups, but Europas points to two examples: a French digital video company that had raised an additional round of funding; and a startup that has just raised a further round that was undisclosed.
The European startups that are using Europas have been formed by a team that is entirely outside of the country, but who is building these businesses. The companies themselves have not been accredited to raise funds from companies that the EU Commission registers as funds of funds.
So, that is why I’m question why Europas hasn’t taken a more favorable response from fund-of- fund investing. Fund-of- fund investing is not the only way to raise money from private investors. Some European startups that I have been following, such as Amsterdam-headquartered Polaris Group, have taken a similar approach (which is why there is an interesting new fund being created in London that is building Europe’s largest investment fund).
Europas may have put some beliefs into its second batch of startups. They’re targeting Europe because of the size of Europe’s population and the availability of the continent’s population as a whole, which will likely lead to a more diverse portfolio of startups, more investment opportunities compared to elsewhere to invest for money, and more money in Europe.
But in its second group list of startups, the list is dominated by five French companies (Acer, Darder, Medibank, Ocado, P&P and Polycom), in addition to three French internet-of-works companies, such as GigiMax (which also has stakes in Europe as part of the funding round), and Adupa

 apps. The idea in essence of these two new apps for iPhone and Android are a way for iOS users to enjoy the convenience of ordering dinner via apps and on their smartphones.
“We have heard from restaurants already and are in the process of launching a new version with the iPhone launch in early 2011. We are also in the early stages of our new app. We are a team of six full-time and are focused on getting to market as soon as possible,” says co-founder and CEO Michael Schillhammer, who founded Bologna in 2007. In addition, the service is in partnership with the restaurant and restaurant brands of its customers to ensure that they have a seamless experience when ordering from the restaurants. “Bologna is the only place to order a good traditional restaurant dinner from anywhere in Berlin,” says Schillhammer. “The entire company was founded by a group of people from university as well as friends of friends from the real estate industry… We are still very new and looking to build a brand on the strength of our restaurant recommendations, which are an easy to use mobile experience,” he says."
"Last week I mentioned a startup named Mok. This company just launched its first iOS application. They are looking to revolutionise the way restaurants are run. It has been a good year for the startup. In October it launched an Android app. The company started by focusing restaurant knowledge and then integrated with Google Maps API. This allowed users an interface on the restaurant and their experience would be enhanced with additional information about nearby restaurants.
Mok has two main products. It is a restaurant database that allows users to see nearby restaurants, search all day and check things to ensure that they don’t miss a spot. But the startup is also looking at new products.
Mok also offers an app that will automatically book your order. This can be useful if you’re traveling around the city and want a different menu than your existing one. In this case, Mok allows you to order dishes from Facebook, email or through the mobile application.
Currently, Mok is a part of Y Combinator. But Mok isn’t the only startup working on a project like this. I spoke with some similar products such as FoodPanda and Food Network.
Mok is a service like this can save travelers years. As it’s a Facebook app, Mok users need only a small database to be integrated and updated. And it’s all integrated in the background. The startup will eventually add a service like this to the app to make it possible for people to discover a new restaurant without leaving Mok. This can also be useful to travel-around restaurants and find an interesting dish in the meantime.
Mok users can still view information about nearby restaurants. Mok is a free iOS application here on iTunes."
"In a world where the ‘big data’ that is the information that is generated and communicated about people and events, it is the people and events that make up a person’s life. It’s the people, events and information that are conveyed by them and the way those events change as our world moves, that are what we see when we get our hands around the big data that companies collect. That data has implications — and can inform our lives.
There is a very interesting example of that happening in the latest round of the OpenStack project and a new set of technologies coming from its founders.
The OpenStack project is all about getting people talking about the cloud and building new data silos to power the clouds of new applications. While this is a very exciting project for the OpenStack ecosystem, you need to understand that it is mostly the people talking and building the tools that can help you in your life.
That could be a new kind of big data project.
For example, that new tool would offer a user interface for a new application using the same hardware that they already use to operate that application.
Or that data could come from a third party platform. This could be a project like SELinux, Red Hat, Box or Canonical, among others.
As it stands, the tools will work on your machine, the hardware, the cloud and the cloud itself. They will not add any new features to the cloud. They will only plug into your existing hardware and cloud resources to build your new application without you having to put any code in the cloud in order to deploy the new application.
The only way I can see to build applications using the latest tools is to develop the infrastructure. If you can’t do that, you will not be able to use any of the products.
The way I describe it is that you need to build an application and you need to build the cloud just on-top of the components of your application. For example, you use OpenShift, an agency in San Francisco and

isch with a team of seven full-time employees, to help it scale up sales, with a new app and web to come.
The company will also be expanding internationally to include new markets that have traditionally been underserved by the global tech sector, like India and the Philippines among others. (I just recently visited the Philippines.) But beyond that, the startup is focused on a different problem: helping brands to improve their bottom lines through better, more targeted advertising.
“Most of the brands have tried a marketing channel to help them generate more revenue through advertising, but we are not a channel,” Siro, in a statement. “We’re not just for selling advertising – We’re for transforming how brands interact with and engage with their customers.”
When I asked Siro how the company plans to make money, he said, “It’s a very different model than most existing solutions, which we believe are at the mercy of their marketing budgets.” The revenue Siro is hoping to generate from its new mobile app, he added, comes primarily from a “firm” based in the United States.
Siro declined to reveal the brand name of that firm, but did disclose that it’d like to be a financial-services or medical company. The application is free to app developers on the Apple and Android app stores, but Siro is looking for a bigger opportunity to integrate its platform into the global market.
“All this money going from the United States to Europe? There are a couple of opportunities and opportunities to build,” he said. “We are interested in other markets that are not currently represented in the United States market. We have great relationships in several other countries that are not currently represented.”
By the way, Siro’s CEO and Co-Founder, Jonathan Brown, is also the former CEO at Microsoft, so you’re getting a pretty stellar mix of both sides of the pond. At a higher level, Siro sees more opportunity in Asia rather than there, and beyond the U.S., where, Siro is seeking to expand beyond Asia in its current footprint. It has also established a global reach in South America, and plans to launch in Europe. (I’ve seen several companies in Asia grow quite a bit to global business, but you can generally say that growth is taking much larger steps to fund the startup’s business in a country like Germany and Japan.)
Siro’s goal is to be a “marketing service” for large multinationals and even smaller organizations, in addition to helping with advertising.
“We want to be a ‘marketing’ solution for international businesses in all sectors,” Siro said. “One of the things that our customers and our customers will really appreciate is an application that they’re actually engaging with.”"
"You’ve probably heard the term ‘marketing’ in other tech startup speak circles, but for tech companies doing business with businesses, there’s a lot going on there that the phrase might even be slightly overused. Marketing executives from companies who buy into marketing, as well as those that do, need to get a sense of what the market wants from them. Here’s one more example that illustrates what the market wants to do with marketing-focused firms: SalesLocket — a marketing-focused startup for marketers — has raised $6 million led by Spark Capital and Sequoia Capital, and will use the funding to launch in the UK.
Here’s what Spark Capital and Sequoia’s Scott Levinthal said in his blog post:
While it’s always worth pointing out, Spark Capital and Sequoia didn’t invest in or contribute to SalesLocket.com –a story that has been one of the stories of late 2013, and perhaps some of the big buzz in marketing tech lately for more than two years.
And here’s a screenshot of the pitch from the company’s website:

Of course, there is still much at stake beyond this idea of what it is that marketers are doing on a particular company’s website, and the idea that some marketing firms are trying to be too clever. But the pitch does illustrate that, in some cases, marketing and sales have become the same thing. “Many brands can get confused by marketing” Levinthal notes in his post. “We know there are big differences in the marketing and sales cycles at many companies. The customer doesn’t necessarily know what’s the value of marketing in one company versus another. They still think of it as a cost, a cost we pay for marketing” he said."
"Last week, a report in the British media suggested that Microsoft’s Xbox console might offer up a price reduction to reduce its

The app’s biggest issue is that they are just not for everyone. There are, however, a number of companies which are looking to solve the problem by offering apps for larger enterprises, like companies in large corporations which have their own employees.
But a company’s business can take time to heal itself. It is something that many businesses don’t know, unless they have experienced this issue. One example is the case of Facebook: They have a small tech team, and there is no clear, effective way to communicate the work being set up, even if someone on that staff has had these problems in the past.
That’s where a company called The Center comes in. This, a group who collectively has written a book on the issue, is a sort of informal, community-driven platform that connects people who are willing to learn and have trouble to people who are willing to learn and have problems to solve.
The Center started out by building a set of tools to link individuals and a broader group of people who want to solve the problem in question. The first was the Center’s toolkit, which was designed to identify issues, problems and problems that they have on-the-job problems and problems that have people on them.
These tools are designed in a way to make people feel like they are “part of the community, and that’s also where the Center can really help,” says Roham, co-founder of The Center who was a co-founder of the first Center.
The new center is designed around a broader group model, where people can apply for the Center and be assigned specific tasks and assignments with specific types of projects that can help identify and help with problems. The Center will then connect them.
The Center is a community where a certain amount of technical knowledge will be given to people who are given tasks and assignments, and people who help find people and problems on-the-job and will bring an immediate level of value to the work they have to do.
To support the Center’s mission, The Center has created a new digital resource called “The Center Stories.” It’s a series of short, non-fiction instructional video tutorials, which can help people identify and identify problems and problems that they have in the past. The Center has also created a crowdsourced, crowdsourced community-powered blog on the Center’s site and an online forum.
All of the Center’s efforts are working to find solutions and build a bridge to bridge the gap.
“This is not a new concept in the world of technology; this is about getting people out of the darkness a bit and creating some value in the process,” said Roham. “These folks are finding an opening and connecting themselves to the real world with an amazing amount of information, and as a result of that, there is a growing opportunity for organizations and businesses to solve human problems in an innovative manner and have people to share their struggles.”

"For years now, The New York Times has been quietly trying to reinvent itself as a print paper. There are a number of other publications and news services hoping for a piece of the market with which to supplement its print business. This group, including today’s New York Times, argues that print media is in crisis and that printing can only go one way.
These companies, which are all vying for the same slice of the print pie, have historically relied on technology to make their prints work more effectively. They have tried to use the cloud to make their print services more efficient and more interactive; however, a decision to shift priorities comes with some serious consequences.
The paper’s decision to go after a new vertical model is driven in part by the paper’s CEO David Rosenblatt, citing its failure to compete in the mobile-first era, as well as an increase in advertising costs, as a factor.

It turns out that print is, at best, not the easiest way to monetize online journalism content and more generally print is becoming less important to the daily news business as consumers consume more information from more platforms.  Among other things, the newspaper’s online and print app and publishing platform — which has been available since 1996 — failed to grow the size of the print community, which it reported as the largest in the world, according to a report by Publishers Association for Newspaper Association.
There are other avenues that other news outlets have tried to bring that model to. But it seems clear that digital is the better option for this.
With print on the decline, it now seems clear that print is in a state of extinction. If it is, it will be interesting to see how New Yorkers react to its demise, or how the paper’s employees deal with today’s

 mom. In the past couple of decades, however, that’s just the beginning of it; today’s consumer electronics will take over the manufacturing industry, from which companies can continue to take advantage of their low-cost, large-scale production costs in order to bring them back to profitability. That is the key, says Gartner’s director Doug O’Brien, as he tells Bloomberg’s Tim Bradbury, with regards to consumer electronics, not only to “retro"
"A company that was known for its hardware but not always for its software, the maker of the iPhone was recently bought by Apple. The Wall Street Journal reports that the company is closing its doors, to be replaced by Apple in approximately a month. The news was first reported yesterday, based on a Bloomberg article published by The Wall St. Journal. We’re hearing that it will see the company shut down with a price of around 7 to 10 millions euros ($8.9 million) per employee, while it will be able to continue using its technology, according to TechCrunch.
The iPhone maker’s new focus is on the enterprise market, where it will continue investing a lot of time and effort to develop a successor to the product it acquired back in June of 2012. In January, the company said that it had passed its 1 billionth milestone during the last earnings report of its financial year.
One would certainly hope that Apple could still consider to have a close relationship with the German company it bought last summer.
In April, TechCrunch said that Apple was working on a new-look iPad and a special display unit in the company’s headquarters in Cupertino, and that one of the projects was already shipping products. Then in June it was revealed that the company was “likely to launch a “flagship iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 that makes sense.”
The iPhone maker has been on a mission to add value to the consumer products that it offers. However, that could change with the new iPhone. Even though the company makes good on its promise of improving the experience of the product, it’s clear that, as long as the old, older technology doesn’t make people jump.
If Apple indeed looks to be putting a new phone company into the world of business — and this one is certainly a potential candidate — it could also consider looking at how Nokia did its business. Nokia’s new CEO Steve Carlin is tasked with a huge challenge — and one of the most challenging that a global consumer electronics company can do today with new products.
With Apple buying Nokia, and Microsoft buying the tech part of Nokia to develop its own phone business under Microsoft at the center of the global market — and with Apple buying Nokia, it also has a shot at making some improvements to its phone. The company has said that it will be producing the iPhone 5s on an 18 million market, and has the resources and market share required to increase its smartphone brand loyalty by more than 90 percent this year.
Perhaps those changes and gains in other products will become the norm. That might mean a return to the iPhone, and perhaps a new CEO at the helm of Microsoft. That is a big question, but if Microsoft’s brand is something that people can still see as a part of Microsoft’s strategy, that could be a way to help to make sure Microsoft can continue to expand its business, and also a way to try to fend off Apple’s larger ambitions to break into the market as a whole.
We’re hearing that Apple will continue to put its resources behind the company — specifically as a brand, which might be a way to make that part of Microsoft more accessible to consumers, and perhaps an easier way for the company to get those consumers to come back.
In either case, the company will continue to put its resources behind the products that it offers, and will continue as its plan, which calls for Microsoft to work on products that it will then sell to consumers."
"Last year, Yappy raised $15.2 million from a number of investors, including Sequoia Capital and Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Today, the app, which was formerly known as Yappy Connect, has been rebuilt as Yappy Connect. That’s the company’s new name. As CEO Jason Zimdars, the new Yappy is more focused on connecting users and connecting mobile developers.
For starters, users will now have an option to share Yappy data by entering in your ZIP code and letting Yappy users automatically see your data as you post your photos. (For example, you can share images from Yappy with Facebook on Snapchat, Twitter, email, Instagram, or elsewhere.)

Finally, Yappy is rolling out an iOS application so apps can easily integrate your data into their apps. And because the app is now native, businesses and institutions can now

’s first two launches in the U.K. this week, with an iPad app available. It’s also a good first step into a wider market, with Amazon claiming in that it expects to reach more than one million people by the end of June.
In a statement last year, Prime Minister David Cameron said that he wanted to “make a grand unifying achievement not just a single technology of the day but make a great unifying achievement. To that end, the Prime Minister has launched The Prime Minister App, an Android app that allows users in the UK to shop in multiple categories and save them to their phone, then sync these memories to their iPad and share them on social network”."
"Fitness-tracking and social network apps are in their infancy in the European Union – and, as always, they represent a very small minority of the overall market. To put things in perspective, in the U.S., fitness tracker MyFitnessPal sits as low as third on its App Store rankings, behind Twitter (16th) and Facebook (22nd), while Fitbits (14th) doesn’t crack the top 50.
So why focus on tracking your steps and exercise? It’s not all that hard to find out.
For starters, the European Commission has a vested interest in seeing more companies get to market to EU citizens, and also those like Fitter, the company behind the popular weight-loss tracker Slim, and more to come.
According to the report, Fitbits is the leading brand in the U.K., followed by its three remaining competitors: Misfit, BodyMedia and MyFitnessPal.
The market research firm also notes that while MyFitnessPal is based in England, that is geographically the only place Fitbit, Misfit and Belly, both based in Germany, are listed in, although MyFitnessPal is based in Denmark.
While it’s only one-third of the company’s revenue in the U.S., Fitbit’s growth could be a long-running factor. It currently employs 80 people across Munich, London, San Francisco and London. Its US subsidiary employs over 200, too.
The European Commission’s report also touches on how the competition is changing in the Internet of Things, which is also where Fitbit has found a strong customer base. The company reported that in 2013, it processed 965,000 steps in more than 4 minutes, which puts it in competition with the likes of Jawbone and Fitbit, and its chief hardware competitor, Misfit Health, which processed 790,000 steps in less than a week.
Interestingly, it notes that the competition has helped to reduce the cost and complexity of implementation, and also provide a window into how some companies have adapted to the changing technology. Fitbit said that since launching a new price-verification system it has grown user retention 30 percent on a run-rate basis for an entire month straight. When it came to sales, it reported the service has already signed up a huge customer base in six countries from all over Europe."
"While it looks like Facebook could potentially be looking for a way to reach new markets, the site’s mobile applications have a very strong base in the U.S. which shows exactly where a company’s products were a bit too far ahead of it.
The news was spotted by TNW’s Jeff Gammell.
One such example, is that Facebook used to be a little game called Bopomobile, but now the company has turned off the “Bopomobile App” altogether and moved into a new app with a similar name, called Facebook.
The move makes sense in terms of timing, given that the company’s app’s success was not exactly a year ago. Now it appears that instead of playing an older game that was too focused on social networking with other apps, the new app is focused on the social networking business with a strong emphasis on social integration.
The news comes at the same time that Facebook is said to be working on an app, “Social.com,” that will let users see how people around them were at the same sports games, shows, places, bars, and more.
Facebook for iOS and Android users have been able to download the new Facebook app on the App Store here here.
Bartos, Facebook’s director of product policy, confirmed the company is working with the FCC on this, but he said there’s been a good deal of interest and feedback with the developers and users of the old app, and it looks like they will be making the new version available soon to all users.
“From our experience in developing the current Facebook experience with users (the experience was much improved and simplified) on Facebook, a lot of people believe this changes make it easier

 is the “Sellbot” type. This is a small electronic device that can be easily converted into the Sellbot mini robot form factor — in the form factor of a robot body. It can be used as an alternative base or controller when a physical version is required.
The device includes a Wi-Fi chip, three USB port and three battery cells for the battery to last three days of battery life (a typical Sellbot battery lasts for 18 hours). As the electronics is in the device you use it, the battery can last a full year of battery life through simple charging. It is a great alternative to a traditional computer mouse/mouse.

Sellbots Mini: The second robot to target is the Pocket Mini (currently with 9x10 movement). This tiny little robot can be used as a mouse/mouse controller (as your hand/fingers don’t need to be moving), as a mouse to track objects (as your mouse can), as the second mode to track objects (as you can see in the picture).

The Pocket Mini is great for children (and parents) who like to collect a variety of different types of objects. It combines an accelerometer coupled with a barometer to create a complex 3D tracking experience. With simple clicks, the Pocket Mini creates a complete sense of immersion and you’ll be using it a lot while playing and gaming.

The main use cases for the device are two of the functions. You don’t want your daughter (or your kids) to accidentally walk into the living room so the Pocket Mini can save your kids life. And once you’ve used it, your kids will love it.
With so many different functions, what is the best way to use/use the device? In this case, in the traditional way, the company chose the Wi-Fi/3G mode for the best experience, and then put it right in the center of the gaming/mouse. With all this, the consumer’s experience feels a lot like a “plug and play” solution.
In the other hand, this model has been designed in such a way that all the functions should be taken from one side, and then from the other. It should be a good fit for families with children under 10 in particular.
For this application, I found a great solution with these functions. In other words, the company is going to find out more about this market over the next few weeks (especially if they don’t release a consumer product yet). At the same time, the company has a decent amount of experience with this kind of product.
In terms of cost, these items are going to be a commodity. This is a hardware toy that is going to be more than an add-on to your computer/laptop/smartphone and you’ll probably find it cheaper (and cheaper) than an original computer mouse/mousepad. So, if you’re a lover of the mouse and mouse controllers, you’re also going to get a great deal here."
"With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the explosion of data storage and processing power, it is not a secret that the next five years will be a watershed event for devices. And so it is that Philips has just released official guidance about what things to expect from its Philips Hue lighting bulb bulbs.
The Philips Hue Bulb is a great bulb. And it has a lot going on under the hood and in terms of specifications — it’s a 10-inch Philips Hue bulb that’s not much smaller than a Philips Hue lightbulb. It’s a fairly light bulb and it’s not as slim as you’d expect, but it also means that you don’t look to your smartphone or tablet as a source of lighting apps. For those without Philips Hue bulbs, it’s not going to be a big deal.
Also going on under the hood: The Hue lightbulb supports a full HD digital media player that’s capable of playing media content, as well as a sensor and speaker. You do need a Philips Hue light bulb to play that stuff, but that doesn’t mean that it’s a good place to get started.
The Hue lightbulb will be released to retailers next month, and it’s available now online at home Depot and online retail chain, The Home Depot. It’s priced at $35.99, which sounds rather cheap for a bulb. But you don’t need to have a Hue bulb in your hand to get the thing here, you can grab it from the Philips Hue catalog at home."
"The iPad mini is a great little tablet. It has a built-in gyroscope motor that tracks your steps and lets you record those steps for both indoor and outdoor and indoor and outdoor modes.

pictured for its share price: up 6.4 percent in after-hours trading.
“We think that we do have a bit of a more interesting business model — the way we offer them is not transactional, the way we’re offering them is unique,” said Jain Singh, head investment manager at Index, in a statement.
A spokesperson for Facebook, however, said that the company is currently testing a new subscription model, which will allow users to “buy” subscriptions that allow them to receive one-tenth of all of the News Feed’s photos as soon they are published. It’s unclear where the price on the service will stand right now, although the press release notes that the pricing is for the first time it will offer any app a subscription.
In fact, the news was preceded by a few days of being locked in an Uber, which raised some eyebrows and concern among the startup community.
[Update: Facebook has now provided me with some official numbers in support of its new subscription service, however, its statement on the subject on Monday is a bit odd in that the new way of buying subscriptions has been tested for now, and it has released some data on that, but the fact that it has to test this at all points to the fact that there has been some frustration that it hasn’t rolled out as soon as it otherwise would has. In part, that’s due to Facebook’s usual reticence, and an editorial decision not to give more information away. The most recent case of being stuck out in a car is in the news today at the very least.]"
"Today, Snapchat announced at the Code conference that it has been acquired by Facebook. This latest deal will take Snapchat’s users (who use its ephemeral messaging apps) to the Facebook platform.
As such, Snapchat is also joining Facebook. Along with Facebook, Snapchat acquired Instagram last year shortly before Facebook bought it, and acquired Instagram+ yesterday.
At least now, that’s all the information you need to know.
While the deal closes sometime this summer, today’s news is certainly exciting.
If there was any doubt that Snapchat might become a serious business, however, it could have been a bit worse now that it will have to work with Facebook on its own terms. While you can now watch one’s life for seconds, there is no equivalent to Instagram’s reach for sharing and sharing those moments forever."
"In a new release, Facebook says that it’s acquired Instagram-owned Pinger, and the result will be a live video feed of photos uploaded by users directly to Twitter. While this sounds a little bit like YouTube, it’s also the same way you can upload a YouTube video to YouTube, and then watch. And if you click to watch on Snapchat, you’ll get the next three seconds in the video. With Pinger’s technology, there’s less lag and more accurate video delivery, and it’s a great way to build an app or website that’s viral.
Here’s how it works:

Pinger allows you to find a video that you’ve liked or shared on a site you’ve already created, then you can watch it. Pinger works with video search in the app.
Pinger will be integrated into Facebook.

Here’s a trailer of it on a Windows Phone:

Here’s a promo video from a company called Funfy that shows the Pinger feature in action. It also lets you choose a camera: from a tablet that you can run on or from your own PC.:

The app was created from the idea of trying to turn your phone into a “video camera.” It is the new iPad/camera accessory that you can choose to buy, which lets you take great 3D and 3D video videos and share them with those you care about. Funfy has a demo using the app. You can see it here.
And you can follow this video to see more, including more videos."
"An interesting change has been made inside the social app, with a couple tweaks that have made some users quite happy. When it appears on a user’s profile, photos are no longer being hidden behind the camera app icon so they’re displayed instead. And if they’re hidden, you can control which ones of your photos appear hidden.
As part of the update, this feature will also come with a new feature called the “Discover New Items” screen that pops up every time you log in from a social networking account. Here, you can choose among the new items on the Discover channel, and if another user has shared the same Discover channel with you, you can click on one of their Discover channels and find it. That should make your Discover New Items experience

======== SAMPLE 1 ========


The latest round, the first reported in late June, is the largest raise in a startup fundraising round (or is a new employee raising?) since that of Facebook’s $5 billion Series D investment announcement in 2012. 
The round comes on the first day of the company’s most recent funding of $3 million in a cash and stock buyback, but also after the company found out that founder Peter Csathy had been diagnosed with colon cancer. After the company underwent a restructuring, Csathy was made the CEO of the company. We’ll be updating this post with any news that we hear from the company, or from a representative of Peter Csathy.
Update: Peter Csathy has confirmed the $3 million raise in an emailed statement to TechCrunch, but declined to provide specific data on how much he actually raised.
I tried to find some kind of information and will update this post should the post be updated, as I will be trying to do this a second time today, July 7, with any news I have on the company.
The recent $5 million financing takes Twitter’s total funding raised in its new funding round to $15.2 million.
Today’s investment comes at a very interesting time for Twitter. The company’s new role in the business of enterprise is a crucial one in defining who its audience is. That includes developers and more. “I think the fact that we have a role in all of our business, that’s why we got this round of investment,” Csathy said in a statement. “As far as development goes, that would be an interesting role for us.”  Csathy told the press in an interview with Reuters that he believes he will succeed Csathy as CEO of Twitter in the future — although that still leaves questions over what kind of relationship he will have with the company.
[Update 2:55pm ET: Twitter confirms the round as well: “We were contacted by the investor that wanted to invest but weren’t ready to make this happen. These investments can be quite aggressive as these people are ready to move on to different roles,” Twitter’s Mike Isaac notes in a blog post. But there are some important questions here, that could make for a more definitive statement: does Csathy still lead development of business decisions? We’ll have to wait to hear what we learn. But we have some good ideas: “If Twitter is to be an investment-driven entity [as is] Facebook, then we need to work hard to ensure that all the components that will drive that forward have a role for us and those roles have a role.”]
Here’s the full statement from Csathy: It’s been a whirlwind of events in the past two weeks for us and the team. We’ve been working to make the product a real asset to the business and provide a platform for all of our business functions to work on. It’s been a fantastic week and we’ve been able to make some incredible progress. This latest round of money and liquidity will provide opportunities to take that another step forward. 
The company has raised $30 million in funding so far, with the latest coming in the past two months when it took a $1.8 million profit from revenue (profit margin) of $0.26 per share. That was its first profit in a very long time.
We have heard a lot of buzz this week and have been hearing more than a couple of times that people are excited about the upcoming IPO. If that comes to fruition and the IPO, there’s no telling what kind of company Twitter could become, in an environment like this, as it looks for other avenues to grow. There will need to be different roles in addition to Csathy, and the fact that we hear that he took on the CEO role with his previous startup is more interesting than any possible: this can help the company adapt how it develops, and it has to compete against its new role with a new product."
"This one is going to be the hardest to play without getting bored. It’s not just about that, though, because the more you play the harder it gets. You learn not to get frustrated when you keep missing something or not getting the right kind of feedback.
The most frustrating part of this game isn’t just that you’re missing something because you’re not getting it just right the second time. You need to continually get up to speed.
This game, as with the previous ones to come, is a real-time, action strategy game. If you were ever in the area of strategy, you’d probably have to turn to something like that and hunt down the wrong types of feedback in an attempt to refine

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 a user in the United States would be able to use their device to find and share information across multiple social networks (Facebook, Foursquare, Twitter, LinkedIn). Users in other countries will still only be able to share within Facebook and LinkedIn.
Now, what’s more interesting are all the other ways that your device can be used, and even more important, there will be an Android version with many useful features — much like Google Now. This includes the ability to create a voice filter (which I’ve even seen this feature in the app itself), to share with a group of friends (who are often called “friends”), chat, play music, read and even share music.
So, to start, I can show my friends my new album cover on Instagram, the photo of a bottle in the Netherlands, or the first photo taken on my iPhone. Of course, if my phone is a “music player,” I can add text to an image as “music from the album of this artist,” or that of a song from another artist. Then, if the user is a music enthusiast, you’ll know this feature already exists:
As you can see, this is already working for me, but also very useful for users already familiar with the concept of sharing music via photos and with just a few taps on your phone’s screen. And of course, the most important, most useful feature is the ability to share a whole folder containing all the relevant links and other content on your phone (like “album”, “shares,” “sounds,” “music” etc. You can add links that are specific to a particular task to any other people you want. (I also love this feature):
The iOS version of the app will be free, but the developers plan on charging for premium features or premium features. However, it’s definitely not a subscription service, so you likely don’t want to go there.
The app is available on iOS, Android and Windows Phone (with Mac and Mac, Windows Phone and Windows Phone coming soon), and on the iTunes here."
"It’s an open secret that in-home care is expensive, but what if you need to have a vet on call on every visit? What if you also need the first round of calls, or have to book your last round? All of which are difficult to manage.
There are a plethora of companies that operate in this space and many of them are the latest to offer the same things — but some are more focused on the latter in the name of cost. While others are trying to do it all and offer something that offers a real service, most of the time you will use more than once or twice, and all of us are pretty terrible at our jobs at the moment even though we might be right in the best interests of an organization.
We hear from a diverse group of companies who collectively try to solve both the problem and the challenge of managing the call process at a reasonable price.
We can give you an overview below. The average in-home care call cost per minute (i.e., the total amount of money paid for the call) is now over $50 a minute in the U.S. and a million dollars in other countries. However, this has to go up to about $250 a minute in developing markets like Indonesia and Vietnam.
While we have used this in-home phone booking product in our home offices for the past 11 years, we know that many callers do manage to book their last round in a way that looks fair at the time of call or visit, and then end up paying the phone bills.
To help solve this problem, M&C has raised $4.5 million, and we are now officially announcing it on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2013 — our New York date.
What does this sound like? The idea of using phones in this way is nothing new. But, it’s really becoming a problem for many. As a phone’s screen has evolved, the demand, not just the user, has turned to our devices to find their life,” said Dr. Jonathan Roffman, CMO – Chief Strategy, Emerging Business Unit at M&C.
One of the largest reasons is that the way people use their phones for various purpose has also evolved. It doesn’t go to the office now. In fact, for many uses, our phones are still seen as the first point of contact,” added M&C Founder and MD, Steve Smith. We’re seeing it in consumer products, such that an average user in Indonesia – where it’s cheaper – still doesn’t go to M&C to book a call. Why? Because the service costs are too high.

 be. While the first model had taken in around half a foot of water, the new AquaFish is a little lighter and more buoyant, says Pleven. “You can see the water coming out the bottom by pulling your finger up on the screen. When it comes out, it’s amazing,” he notes, “which doesn’t happen often enough in a screen.” 
In addition, a bit of a surprise to some, the new AquaFish has a very large touchscreen, which is good enough, as you can get large screens everywhere, but one of the downsides is that it’s not the kind of thing you can do with a normal keyboard. The screen is larger than normal, as you can see, and as a result, you need to hold your button/slide down on the trackpad to use it, which will make your fingers more uncomfortable than normal keyboard-filled devices. Plus this is the case is all-glass, not just coated aluminum which means you’ve probably never used them as much as they would for the AquaFish. It’s this Glass screen, on the other hand, which will make some progress in terms of portability, since it can hold onto your phone while you’re using it right in the pocket.

In terms of the device’s features, Pleven says the new AquaFish has four buttons for home button, and can be used to take photos or video. If you’re thinking of switching to a touchscreen phone, I think you’re going to go for the latter (you’ll be able to share photos via Facebook through the new device, as well). It’s not as much of a gimmick as it could be if it comes to the screen, I think, but Pelven admits it’s a little like a flip phone in some ways. “I think to people that just get the app, they think about it as a gimmick, or something that can tell you if you’re going home,” he explains. “You do get your real-world experience where it can work because of your phone.”
Another cool feature, the screen can now be reversed for better viewing, with a toggle button that lets you either use the screen to rotate the glass or the flip for a more comfortable, floating perspective, while changing the resolution of the screen from 635 x750 to 768 x360. At its top-level of power is the fact that the display is RGBD. This way, you can use it to get a better picture of your current activity without any lag or other visual distortion, for example.
It’s worth continuing to experiment with the new AquaFish overall, but for now the company is happy with its current sales efforts and a potential future where it sees more of this sort of gadget, a new device which will give people a little more choice in what kinds of notifications they want to engage with, without having to worry about setting up their phone and plugging in.
Pleven remands of saying there are no plans for more devices based on the new AquaFish, but the company is looking at what options there are and where a flip phone would fit.
“We had some really successful products in the past that we’ve passed over to other companies, but we weren’t doing that [in Fusion],” explains Told in the interview. “But if we were to try to do something based on the platform and the market, we’d have to rethink it.”"
"Founded in 2006, Airtime is a company that has been working on ways for companies and business owners to use social networking to create a network around products and technology. Today, the company is bringing on a new CEO and will be expanding to include a mobile presence.
Kevin Lam, who had been Airtime’s CMO, was selected this year to serve as CEO of the company. According to CrunchBase, Lam will be taking over from co-founder John Boyder who is taking on the role of General Manager.
Airtime’s service was launched as an iPhone app in November of 2012, but the company soon expanded this service into a mobile application as well in March 2013. In addition, the company launched a beta version in November of 2014.
The company raised an additional $25 million in funding in 2014, and expanded to two new markets, including China and Taiwan. It grew out of being a consumer-focused social network only in two regions – the Chinese and Taiwan, for example, where it now targets 200 million unique

-right device, but the new phone was the fastest selling. The new iPhone is selling at a rate of nearly 70 percent month to month, in comparison to the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5. The new device was also the best selling device when it launched in the past 48 hours, and was the fastest selling of all the new iPhones sold in the past 24 hours.
This is likely a big day for sales of the Apple Watch. Apple had the lowest daily active Apple Watch unit sales month (in) a month (in), and the greatest sales per share month (in), in 2014, but they still managed to hold on to the lead with a better, stronger product than Apple had to sell in the past 24 hours."
"With the new iPhone, Apple’s mobile phone platform, Apple Watch, and iPhone’s Siri, we’ll learn the first of Apple’s iOS 9 applications, but the new iPhone 6s and 6c’s launch will be just a few days away, at which point we can make predictions about the time that the release will be announced, how likely it is, and whether it’ll launch on or after September 16, Apple’s own timeline for when it will launch. Apple does make such great guesses when it comes to when its first new app will launch, but as of today you’ll be treated to a preview of that app, showing it’ll go on sale September 16 at 10am US, 4:00pm and then the night after, which is at the new iPhone Store (if not on any Apple Watch). Apple’s latest release of iOS 9 is slated for August 9, so the Apple Watch launch will go on August 9.
And that’s good, in theory. Apple Watch still can’t launch directly in the Watch app, which is something that’s been handled on the watch since the Watch 2 released last year.
Today, it’s released its first WatchKit application, which we’ll use for a bit of comparison. It will be available from September 15 at 10am (1pm), and then the next day or two after, in the Watch app, which will be available in September 17. There will be some kind of timeline with the details about when it will be available, similar to how we do things around September releases.
I’m excited about this, of course, as it gives me a bit more info on how Apple Watch functions. But at that moment, my biggest question is whether or not it can even work in the Watch app, because in the Watch app’s launch screen, we can’t launch directly to the Watch. However, Apple Watch apps can work in other forms of applications like the Apple Watch, and we see a good chance that it does not support it. For the sake of the watch, I’b definitely going in the Apple Watch. For now, watchOS and Windows 8 apps, I see them as the go to apps for this article, but I’ve reached out to Apple to inquire. If it did, it could have released its WatchKit apps as one more app, but a more minimal experience, which has the advantage of helping the Apple Watch launch in September.
To test the OS, we will get an update to iOS 9 after September 15. If the new version comes today, the update may come sooner and later, so let’s check…

That doesn’t mean the new versions won’t be available at all times, it just means that they will likely get pushed out first.
The new iOS 9 software preview will be live for iPad devices in September 17 and the Apple Watch will have a dedicated app for that. If you’re on an iPhone, you probably already know that if you don’t have the new iOS 9, but a more recent, higher quality iteration, you’re going to be able to run the app on both of the new phones."
"Apple has been testing out new designs for the iPhone 7, and the new iPhone is basically identical from last we’ve seen it. But this is where Apple’s newest design really shines, as it’s more than just the same design. Apple wants the iPhone 7 to be as simple as possible, which could be considered something of a “iPhone 7.5” for iPhone 7.
In fact, the iPhone 6s and 6c’s designs use a very similar form factor and physical layout that could make it easier to understand exactly what is what.
For the 7.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus, Apple has adopted a thinner shape and the added features will not be found in the iPhone 5.
The iPhone 7 Plus also has a fingerprint reader for the back that’s able to take up to eight taps to authenticate using your fingerprint to unlock or perform a specific

level features the rest of the ecosystem, but without the complexity. The goal is to make the user experience as simple as possible without requiring a developer to spend a billion bucks to add a layer.
The new feature is now available to all Windows Store app-level developers running Windows App Simulator, Visual Studio.

Previously, Windows Phone platform-level APIs were only available to Microsoft for Surface and Lumia devices. The new capability will bring the ability to use the Windows Phone platform to power third-party applications. These platforms have no versioning between the Windows Store and Windows Phone. This allows developers to release Windows Phone 7.5 apps that can compete with iOS and Android platforms.
Windows SDKs also includes support for Universal Windows Platform apps such as Windows Server applications. These feature apps make Windows Store apps accessible to developers who want to make Windows Store apps accessible to other companies.
The Windows Store is often used as a developer landing point and communication channel for third-party applications. That makes Windows Store developers the first port of call if the Windows Store app needs to run on a Windows device and the customer wants to purchase a Surface or Lumia device.
The Windows Store App SDK has a $100 million funding round as well, which could represent a potential exit opportunity for Microsoft and Microsoft. Windows Azure has been in a steady decline over the past few years. Microsoft wants to help developers who work in Windows Azure create better Windows Store apps without the need for Windows Azure. We covered Azure’s recent failure and the company’s plan to launch a new service for Windows Azure (Windows Azure App Service).
The Microsoft Surface App SDK was released in late 2011 and it’s also gaining adoption today in the Windows Store. The number of app installs on the Windows Marketplace surpassed 1 billion during the past 30 days, meaning that Microsoft has seen 1 million Windows App Developers sign up to use it.
The Surface App SDK is also being used by developers to enable Windows Store app development on the Windows Store for Microsoft Windows apps. If you want to see screenshots of how it works, then have a look at the video below."
"I’ve long felt that it’s only a matter of time before the next generation of business computing experiences are built off the backs of consumer interest and connectedness, rather than the back of enterprise reputation or traditional business intelligence in the traditional enterprise world — and that’s part of the reason why my recent TechCrunch Disrupt New Jersey conference is so interesting. 
But when I spoke to CEO Dave Goldberg at Disrupt last year, he also hinted that the day when enterprise-centric companies are the center of gravity in the enterprise world — before the cloud era and consumerization, the enterprise sector was traditionally dominated by large corporations, and it was only when the consumerization of IT got to a point where IT agencies were concerned about the security risks from the proliferation of smartphone technology, “The first thing that the guy at the big company that you’re trying to reach through an acquisition from would say is, ‘Oh no that’s not my phone.” He was talking about the concern that many government and financial institutions were getting about the possibility of the proliferation in smartphones and security — and so it’s not just Goldman’s usual take on the security of business, but the enterprise sector itself. 
Goldberg said that’s not all of the concerns companies had about security and consumerISM, noting that some enterprise security researchers had found security flaws in BlackBerry’s latest handsets that let hackers take control of the handset in order to steal personal information. 
Another factor that might have added to the concern was the growing number of smartphones in the handsets market. These phones, for example, have a built-in pass-through pass-through device key to unlock them, which could be stolen if an attacker gained access to them. 
Goldman also noted that BlackBerry is addressing this at the time. 

“Bing,” he said, “is actively working to strengthen security by doing a comprehensive certification of BlackBerry and pass through,” and that will also offer them a complete certification chain and certification. We will be doing a thorough certification process so that if people want to run their app, they will be running them through a rigorous series of security checks, including a complete data breach. I think that the reason why BlackBerry chose to invest in data security as one of their top priorities was it’s very clear now that they’ve been trusted by customers and partners.
And the company took another proactive step with its security solution, which they call Pass It Forward, today, in the hopes of protecting customers — or customers of all businesses — from attacks by malicious hackers. The Pass It Forward security solution, Goldberg pointed out, uses encryption to protect the data on customer accounts from outside thieves, while Pass It Forward gives enterprises a single security level, letting them run multiple apps in concert.

 especially you’re moving in time, is still a pain. That’s what I was thinking. That’s what I wanted.
“The idea, I wanted to do it in a real-time context because it’s a very real thing you’re doing and you don’t have to think about it. And for people who don’t know what that means – as everyone in the future said, no one can know what they’re doing at some point – it’s still real-time,” says Paparatt when asked what it was about the concept.
“It crowdsources my thought process with people in the future and hasn’t quite worked out,” he adds, although he concedes the concept could well survive a different user-designed app approach and a nebula-inspired approach.
“We see it more like a new kind of hyperreality,” he says. “”
To that end, Paparatt admits any intense momentum for virtual reality in the past has been led by Facebook, with the company launching its virtual reality platform ‘Facebook Live Feeds’ last year, which the company is today making a fully integrated part of its Facebook.com experience. But the company also recently launched a new product of its own called VR 360, an experience that lets users share 360-degree videos filmed inside its game world with their friends, family and the wider community of game developers.
And VR is no longer limited to the gaming industry, at least in the near future (Paparatt notes that with FB’s acquisition of Oculus Rift in February, it has become clear to VR players to take Oculus at the company. And with the Facebook News Feed and Open Graph, the future for VR is in the service’s apps and content — with its own platform). The move Paparatt is making is a result of a renewed interest in social features, he notes, citing a “recently increase in users and interest” amongst VR developers to Facebook — and noting that this has led Facebook to “a change of direction with [its VR platform]” — with the company now trying to focus more on content and content creation, rather than social promotion.
“For years we’ve been a content company in content creation,” Paparatt adds. “ We know now Facebook is becoming a player in content creation.”
Paparatt describes the change in strategy which Facebook is pushing today as an incremental move in a broader culture shift on creating new kinds of consumer experiences: “They are being pushed down. We are constantly going back to the drawing board and moving slightly back to the creative imagination where we are going to build new apps that push the envelope. We’m continuing to be creative we still have this focus on creating new user experiences and new content and new content.”
Paparatt said this move will not involve a change in Facebook’s social features. “There will be no new Facebook Social functions beyond Facebook News Feed,” he says. “We will continue to do business with those that continue to be a part of our global community. And they still have the very strong ownership of the content that we have published and the content that has been published.”
He says that although the company has not disclosed user numbers on its social apps platform, at least some of the developers it partners with are starting to share some of their stats to the public.
“It’s the best way of sharing the content and showing it to your friends, a different way of doing it. We started rolling out this new functionality a few months ago and in just a short time it just grew to be the next top app in the country in terms of users,” he added today.
Paparatt declined to say how many games Facebook has published so far, or any revenue figures — saying the company will not share its financial numbers or market share figures at this point.
The new partnership will see Facebook providing support and insight to developer partners for the platform. It will also create new categories, based on app usage, for example based on how many users have interacted with a developer’s app, says Paparatt,

 If’s a way to let kids know they are still alive and they are not having a sad night and they’re alive again they can look at photos of all of the cool things,” says Bierman.
“Our hope is that people who’s life will not be like this forever will just see the first part of the series and say this is going to be a crazy adventure — it was the last great adventure. Not that our life can be like this forever. But it was fun, it was fun,” adds Bierman. “That’s what made us want to bring about the app.”"
"In a round of layoffs of its own — including six employees and 15 contractors — Uber Technologies has laid off 20 of their staff, with plans to lay off another 20 people. Another 25 are set to leave by the end of the year. Uber says the company will have to slash costs in the short-term to bring its operations into balance with the fact that it takes a 15 percent cut on each transaction for Uber.
Uber Technologies has come a long way since the start of that ride-sharing service that grew out of TechStars in 2009.
The company started as a spinoff from a taxi company, backed by Accel and Trident Capital. Then in 2009, the company acquired a technology network firm called Glu, which focused on getting taxis back on the streets in New York City, and launched a ride-sharing service called Uber Connect on the platform in London, inspired by Hailo.
Then, in February 2012, Uber started to look at hiring software engineers, and has been trying to expand the business to more of the urban areas where it still has a bit to grow. Uber is working with the University of Maryland to try to bring more computer science and engineering into Uber as it ramp up funding from Uber and other investors in its expansion plans.
In August 2012, the company hired first time engineer, Adam Rios, who was recently graduated from TechStars, and engineer Jay Lee-Flock, who’s had a computer science degree at Columbia, as senior software engineers. The two were working in London, they said, and met with Flock who had previously studied computer science and computer vision at Calvert and then graduated to work in London.
Rios and Lee-Flock then set off on the trip to Dublin last year and finally landed in New York, Ireland, where they met Lee-Flock and Rios in a Starbucks Coffee Shop, “right out of a box.” While at the coffee shop, they discussed a way for Uber to give riders a better experience by providing the ability to buy their transportation in a more traditional fashion — something that has been seen in other cities such as Palo Alto — using a mobile app that shows you where you are going and gives you your daily schedule.
Then suddenly, the idea of a smartphone app that tells you where your ride is coming at a time — with a feature that is built in partnership with Ola in the U.K. — it took root and a company that is built on a more mobile and less tech-centric model like Uber emerged.
While the early team looked at other mobile services like Lyft, Hailo and Instapaper, they decided to concentrate on Uber. And in the short years afterward, Uber is still in a partnership with the startup that allows them to give riders a new ride every day, and they have also begun offering drivers the ability to get a more immediate ride on the Uber platform by typing “Lure.” Drivers have more freedom in what they do with their ride, they said.
In other cases, it is being reported in some of the sources that wasnearly fired for refusing to work with Uber.
The report comes after Uber launched its “demand-less” service at the end of last year, bringing Uber’s drivers to more than 400 markets — up from just a few dozen in 2014. Some of these have been able to get hired back into jobs in other markets, but many of these have been cut off from Uber’s expansion plans and have their contracts revoked.
As of this writing, some 20 of the employees, contractors and contractors who were let go and laid off are still working at their desks. But the report of layoffs continues.
When I first wrote about Uber in February, there were some rumors it was looking to cut costs. Now, the company does have some of its costs covered by its partnership with partner companies, including payments like its partners taking a share of revenue.
Still, the company is facing tough times, and many executives have expressed concern that in the short term it would be unable to grow in the U.S.
As Bloomberg reported last week that the company is looking at a new acquisition as there were rumours that Uber was looking to buy Lyft. Uber issued a

 to its Android app.
And if the iPhone version of this site is going to live up to its “original vision” of a Google Play Music Music store, then it’s best to welcome Apple Music to the platform, and not only to welcome the Android app to the list of available sources for streaming content, but to offer a great complement to its existing offerings.
Apple is clearly excited to bring Google Play Music to Android, but it needs a more compelling alternative, including the ability to use the iTunes Match API to search to identify and share content with other folks, and the ability to track and view individual streams from other sources of music on the network. If we can get Google Music from Play Music, then, why not just offer a Google Music store on Android as well?
And that’s actually good news for consumers, because it means more availability for Google Music streaming devices, which the industry is in dire need of. More than 10 million devices, and some 35 million people per year, use the Google Play Music app on their phones. More than 80 million users remain inactive during their free passes, and Google Music is not yet making major moves to monetize the service.
The only solution to make Google Music better is to allow consumers to sync it with the Music app they already have installed on their phone. This is critical because it would give users one easy access point for streaming music that comes with their phone. It’s important because it would let users choose and share music sources from their phone, but also because it will allow them to create personalized music listening recommendations when they leave the app.
It’s also worth noting that Apple recently took a step by adding a feature that would let users share and play music to their mobile accounts, allowing them to use their own music, upload and enjoy it, sharing them with their friends. Today’s big tech companies continue to fight for Apple access to the music streaming space, and in particular the music streaming services of music streaming services that offer free accounts with their standard pricing and without the fees, and that’s where some of the rumors regarding a deal with Spotify have started to fade.
Perhaps the most important part of the Apple Music plan could be the ability to sync and stream music across services like Facebook and YouTube. Google recently acquired Napster for $315 million, and Apple CEO Tim Cook recently said that Apple has been in discussions with Spotify, Facebook and Spotify about the potential merger. But Napster and Spotify would offer services that complement those from Napster, including the ability to watch music from the Napster app automatically syncing and sharing with social networks, and the capability to listen on YouTube automatically.
Apple Music’s initial push to get users into the service with their existing iTunes libraries could be one option that we’ll see in the future, but for now it appears that Apple Music is being designed for the average user as it has an appeal to people, though it’s certainly not offering a comprehensive playlist app like Spotify or Facebook Music. Apple Music does offer access to the most popular popular genres, but this is not something that Apple Music will likely do without serious friction, especially given its focus on music streaming.
Apple Music’s app is in the middle of its evolution. Apple Music is designed to be a curated experience, with the ability to sync your music and watch streaming with the Apple Music app, plus it has a ton of great features that Apple Music is built on. The app itself offers an easy way to see, search and browse your library, along with other useful navigation options. It will continue to use the Music app, which has been a popular source for music music streaming today.
As the industry has moved to offer streaming music services and services designed for DJs, there has been a push in the past few months, backed by a recent report from IHS Global Markets that estimates that Spotify alone is up 700% year over year, and Apple Music is up 300%.
Apple Music will have to keep up with Spotify and Facebook Music, but some may have the hope that they can win those over with features for iOS and Android. Those features could include Apple Music’s integration with mobile messaging services, to add a feature that is very much like the one they already use on Facebook Music that they could later move to their own iTunes, iTunes, Rdio, and iTunes Radio and iTunes Music Playlists and Radio.
Spotify can be used by DJs to promote their music on the social networks, while Facebook Music could be used by DJs for their listeners, and with a third source of music it could be a Spotify integration. The Apple Music product manager is likely to take on Spotify in a similar way.
Apple Music is clearly a streaming music service and Apple Music has been about as much of an entertainment service as a music product manager. The Apple Music service is aimed at the music lover of course with the ability to listen to music when you’re working. And Apple Music

 preferences of what to think of the most significant things of the day. You can do more than just a single single picture, you can do much more than just just a single series of pictures.

With the proliferation of photos available in the digital world, we’re going to see a massive increase in the variety of images for us to choose from, which is what led to our own obsession with photography. A lot of times when people ask about their camera, they talk about being able to capture moments with friends, loved ones, or other people, but few actually know any details about the moment that comes with sharing pictures.
With the ubiquity of photo images, that’s going to change at some point. Whether we end up in a position of being able to capture moments around us in real time is something we will find out in the next few years, but we are likely to have to be able to connect with someone.
Photo and video has been very much an important way of socializing online. A lot of things we do as individuals as a result of sharing photos is through video, and that continues to remain a major part of how we interact with others, and with those around us, too."
"A few weeks after our Meetup tour stop in NYC, we are returning for a second meetup in Los Angeles. In this next edition of Top Ten, we talk to Chris Velazco, founder of the LAUNCH, as he gears up for a move into the Valley’s latest fad – Founders.
This time, the stage is being erected for a battle between a few seed funds and one-time LPs. The first thing that Chris says is, “We’re probably not a Founders class,” and that many Founders don’t have the connections and capital to get them in the door, he says. He’s right on that point.
Chris has made a few appearances in AngelList, but is ready for the next round. Chris has made about a dozen investments and launched and pivoted around ten companies in his past three and a half-decade.
These companies are doing the exact same things that founders do, whether it’s fundraising, selling technology, working through an accelerator, or pivoting around a new location and genre.
But, while it’s easy to see a path for founders, and it’s true that Founders don’t get the same traction in the early market, Chris is still making it in his own right. When a Google-enabled entrepreneur with a hardware background had a hit on the LAUNCH, he never left, Chris was on a mission to start up a hardware startup.
But it would be an American Idol-based show before Chris became a VC with 500 Startups.
Fast forward to April, and the new-ish hardware startup raised $1.5 million in March, then $3.4 million raised in April, which was a Series A round led by Greylock.
Chris got his start through the accelerator and had the opportunity to pick up more hardware cash.
The accelerator was co-founded by TechStars and ReadytoFund, investors that brought in early-stage capital and helped him get in touch with Greylock and FundersClub. In September of last year, Chris took the stage at TechStars NYC to discuss the differences between accelerators for hardware products, including those of Greylock, Founders, as well as those that focus on hardware.
The LAUNCH event was originally in San Francisco. But, with its strong tech focus and a focus on hardware, Chris said, “The LAUNCH event is actually in LA County. The LAUNCH hardware accelerator is the best bang for the buck,” he told techCrunch.
After seeing how excited he was with Founders, Chris decided to launch the accelerator in San Francisco, after the LAUNCH event. Chris now has a few projects up and running.
I know what you are going to say. In fact, Chris and I talked recently about how important a hardware accelerator is for hardware startups.
Chris, you have to go through the TechStars accelerator in San Francisco. This is a good way to get started.
Thanks to Chris Velazco and Robert Scales for reading along.
In addition, don’t miss our TechStars London event in August and attend our TechStars LA event in November. Chris and me (Chris Velazco) talk to great hardware entrepreneurs to answer their questions. We ask them about their experiences in the accelerator, and which hardware projects are the hottest at the moment.
Get your tickets to attend this next season of TechStars in San Francisco here, or see you there in September."

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Many, but with a few hundred million users, the company is able to make this kind of reach easier.
But as companies like WhatsApp and Facebook move into offering video, and more apps make it far easier for people to share to their networks to stay in touch with others through those pictures, other video services will continue to provide a vital piece of the WhatsApp puzzle: allowing you to share more pictures within your personal circle without having to jump through hoops to find the right place to post them or save them.
One of the biggest names in mobile messaging, SMS, has recently been the subject of a major shake-up. The SMS app, now with 7.5 billion users in 60 countries, is now owned by Taiwanese mobile carrier Naver — the company said today that it had acquired the company for $800 million, but this was not officially announced.
It’s unclear whether the rest of Naver would continue to operate as it has, or be acquired by any other company, like it has in the past. Naver now supports WhatsApp as well.
Naver is now making its next messaging service free and plans to add other messaging apps soon, the company said in a statement.
Other carriers are also reportedly interested in making it easier to use SMS with free calls and messages. As we reported last month, Nokia could also consider a free, paid SMS service for Lumia line users, and its $99 Lumia 520 was spotted to be at CES this year alone.
A few weeks ago we saw a report from MobileNews about Naver being in the process of acquiring a company called Nvemo.
Nvemo had been on a mission to become the first brand of video services to adopt the Facebook API. Nvemo, meanwhile, has been making videos on its app for years, but the rollout process took some some four to eight months to complete.
MobileNews today, reporting that Nvemo had reached 70 million users, said that the service would be completely open-source, giving people free access to the API’s videos without any code needed to view the content on Nvemo.
That will be a challenge for these carriers, who will have to release a new service to attract users to an open source product when they are trying to fill the gap with their own users, not just by offering content through a Facebook Messenger-like Messenger app.
The issue here will be the costs. Naveen Selvadurai (a VP of Marketing at the company, who previously founded social shopping site eVentures), who heads up the company’s business development efforts, told me he expects Nvemo to do $1 billion in revenue this year alone.
Facebook has made its efforts to make its own version, Facebook Messenger, even more popular by offering more direct messaging features. The company has also been working to broaden the ways it can bring its Messenger app to new markets.
However, as we pointed out at the time of its launch in the United States, Facebook has seen some backlash over its Messenger app and this latest acquisition by Naveen Selvadurai.
We’ve asked Naveen to say why he thinks this is happening now, and if they have plans to address the pain point of having to download Messenger before messaging apps, which is what he sees as the future of the mobile messaging business.

The answer, he says, is that while it’s been true that Naveen’s experience helped motivate his own, the new wave of mobile, video apps has created “a real gap in the world in terms of the way people communicate.”
It’s clear the way people communicate on mobile apps has largely been through the browser, then through the voice commands at text-only menus that offer a very limited interface. In contrast, the voice commands are also very limited, and most of what’s available on mobile are mobile-only, requiring users to download a mobile app to access them. It’s still a bit confusing and less mobile-powered than text.
“One can’t just replace voice with video, because that’s the thing that’s happening right now.” he said. There’s a market for this kind of app, but only “a few dozen.”
In contrast, Naveen said “tens of millions” of users are going to do “many dozens of apps,” and “less than a million” are taking video calls over Messenger. “Messaging is a great, long, fast, powerful product, but it’s not the only thing we’re doing.”"
 and they’ll be able to see it.
While Snapchat may be getting its big second test as a standalone, standalone app, it’s not abandoning its roots as a product and moving more

 change there.”<|endoftext|>Google is already working on something it calls ‘Project Tango,’ which is the long term term term solution to ‘Project Apollo,’ where the obel-wire on Android will ‘tango’. Google’s new framework is designed to integrate with an Android-based ecosystem of APIs, which it’s aiming at Android and developer ecosystems across all devices.
Google’s first ‘project’ to create a single ecosystem is ‘tango,’ which was revealed in May when developer preview was revealed, and it’s been going on a stealth diligence so far, but it’s getting a lot of interest in it for its use of the Android application platform, and because it’s something which is a lot wider-ranging than the usual Android application framework.
Google describes it as a “data-as-a-service” (DAaaS) that will provide an API to “customize, customize, customizeize and customize the mobile UI for the user,” and includes the ability to add widgets, to push notifications, to track the performance of your software, to make the UI itself more interactive and to help a software engineer make changes.
Google said one of five types of apps that it’s looking to add will be used in the new API — the software that will build out the data that’s gathering and gathering, the app itself, the widget, the application, and so on.
“We believe the tango APIs will be a big source of data storage and mobile services, especially for enterprise users,” and also that it will enable the user to better inform the software on how the system can handle user data.

It’s also possible that by embedding the API into the app itself you can increase the security and usability of the user interface, and to make it secure for both the user-facing app itself and the end-user applications you incorporate in any way, even if they may be sensitive data.
In addition to making the data gathering and gathering process faster and more efficient, a tango could bring together a number of different types of data, so as to generate new business intelligence analytics data, and so on.
In some cases, Google’s decision to go after the end user was a good one in terms of the appability of user-accessing Android, but it also shows the challenges of making it easily usable to a wide enough audience for the time being (mostly) blind to a challenge of making sure Google’s future operating system still serves them as their primary platform."
"After a month of uncertainty, it may have finally answered the question: is Twitter free of foreign data requests. A new report from security firm McAfee has put out a classified interview with Twitter CEO Dick Costolo in which the company says it will honor requests based on national and global law-enforcement needs. It’s a step in a direction where Twitter might be looking to shift its business back to its own law enforcement efforts.
“As we have said before, we do not receive requests for user-to-sign-on-any-account,” Twitter said in a statement today. “Our enforcement team, including our current and former leadership team, and local, independent, regional and international law enforcement, have authority to make these actions in an extraordinary level, while respecting rights and liberties.”
The report was written by McAfee’s team of experts in cybersecurity and state of the world security — as well as top lawyers and tech companies. It is interesting for a couple reasons.
As the lawyers point out, this is a first for Twitter to acknowledge a ‘unconditionally free’ relationship with law enforcement.
“Twitter is working very closely to law enforcement in this regard; we’ve told law enforcement that we would not allow their information to be used in this manner,” Twitter added.
Twitter has been a strong advocate of the position that the privacy and security of its services provide as vital to the company as anything else. If telling the law enforcement that its policy will remain unchanged seems particularly telling, then as a result, Twitter ‘says it will not engage in the process”.
Taken in aggregate, however, it suggests Twitter may be turning down law enforcement requests for data access or access to its app — and that law enforcement may need to take specific steps to ensure only the right law enforcement officials can

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 but a few days ago, the company shared that it had been acquired by AOL for a reported $700 million. That deal was officially confirmed last month, but there was also an auction in the back of the store.
The big question is, what’s coming up for the future of the brand?
The answer will be interesting to see how much of a role it plays now as a mobile app. The company has gone mobile-first (on Apple devices), but there’s still a need to build out its brand in a way that’s more traditional to the “mobile first” strategy. That has to be how it will eventually grow beyond just the “mobile first” strategy. The mobile store will also be where it makes money. But perhaps the most important question is, how it will evolve into something more than a brand.
It may not be the most interesting, or it might just be a gimmick. It just doesn’t make sense that way. The mobile app will still have lots of potential if you’re just looking for a place where you can find your items or read articles.
The big question for Facebook is how the company will develop this concept in the coming months. Will the company offer some sort of deal site for finding items or to read more content — in the vein of something like Digg, but more business-like (a bit of a hybrid), or some other way for users to find what they want for the day.
But there’s a big opportunity ahead. As one source at the company noted when I asked if the mobile app was going to be any more than just a mobile app, “mobile first was always the plan.”
In a blog post this morning, Jason Sitz, who runs Facebook mobile, called the mobile product “a very polished and seamless experience” — that was a pretty strong sentiment for the company.
(Facebook isn’t the only one to come to this conclusion as the company has been linked in some other circles with being interested in virtual reality and 3D printing in the past.)
Facebook certainly isn’t the first to have tried to make a mobile app. Facebook’s Messenger app and its official app, Facebook Home, launched back in 2010.
But Facebook’s mobile app strategy just doesn’t work when you look at it from a business perspective. You can use Facebook as a business tool, a place where business users are already using Facebook and are spending more time on the site. But from a user perspective, Facebook has been less than successful as a business service. For now, Facebook seems to be trying to push users — even without the app — to find other ways to access the service.
Facebook is clearly trying to help the company build out a business strategy for the service, but it doesn’t want to let Facebook into the business. Facebook is already working with partners — it recently partnered with Snapchat to allow users to send photos to each other via Messenger. And some have predicted that the company will consider monetizing the service via a way for the service to be paid for by businesses.
At this point, the company is still trying to figure all of its pieces out. You can hear rumors of a new Timeline feature, the company announcing a new “public” status update (that’s the new Facebook page for the Facebook for Pages) and the launch of its redesigned Graph, but Facebook just hasn’t done any work on these last two products.
(Facebook says it has “no plans to create additional web integrations in the near future.”)"
"The rise of apps like Instagram and Facebook has made it harder for people to resist sharing on the service — and the same is likely to be the case for Google+.
It’s no secret that there’s a growing need to connect with specific friends and social groups on Google+ or other social networking services. That’s where a new, social networking app called “Google+,” that it’s launching today, wins’ the race.
It’s like a Facebook for Google+. In its debut trailer, the show highlights a number of things Google+ is all about. It’s where you can share photos and other content with friends, and it’s about keeping up with what’s going on around you. That means it becomes somewhat similar to a Facebook or Instagram, and also an important piece of communication that remains popular with the younger users that Google+ has managed to convert.
Google+ may still be a bit of a catch-all among some of us; Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, LinkedIn and YouTube already have their own standalone apps. But Google+ has already been catching on with the younger crowd.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 nearly all the rest. A couple of different kinds of data sources are involved in today’s story, one of them being Facebook and its latest user base, which it revealed is around 45.5 million globally. The other is that the company has made a bunch of acquisitions of its own, and has been working on its own social networks in the last couple of years (Facebook’s app platform and its own Facebook Pages). Twitter isn’t the only big service this year, with Facebook also acquiring Instagram and Pinterest. The two services could end up in play at some point in the not-so-distant future. We’ll also probably see WhatsApp get an update this year as well, though no word yet."
"Voxiq, the social news aggregation app, has already raised $1.9 million, we’re hearing through a tipster. That amount is not huge, but if the financing has any sort of correlation with Facebook’s fundraising, it might be.
Voxiq is actually Facebook, but that doesn’t mean that the company isn’t going all-in on its social platform.
The app is built with Facebook on top of Twitter data. For example, a user has a retweet and likes Tweeted tweet of their friend’s post, they’re tagged in a friend’s feed and liked that post, and their name appears in their feed. Their interests are displayed alongside the social graph of their friends, which is a fun and unique way to tell friends which posts and posts are good, and you could use a Voxiq to tell where to post your own stuff.
Another key feature Voxiq is working on is a way to share news. Facebook, obviously, is the go-to channel to post to. A Voxiq is going to need all those social networking sites to make sense.

So what Voxiq does, in fact, is it combines this platform with the usual social network services, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and so on. Users sign up for Voxiq just as they do most services these days and have to take a quiz of a few questions, like “what’s the most interesting post you’ve ever written?” and “what is your favorite brand with thousands of fans?”
These answers go through an experience with several swipe-like answers to one another. One swipe means that you agree. A click on the “You agree” button means that you agree. Then you tell Voxiq your interest type, favorite brand, or your own social feed, and Voxiq will do the rest as you move in the feed, and the answers for that type reflect similar interests.
Finally, after you’re finished with the story and have “liked” your story, you click the “You agree” button and the service is done.
And it doesn’t stop there. If you’ve liked someone else’s story and the page post you’re reading then the service will go down — so you don’t have to go through the process with everyone else.
Voxiq was built with data from a number of services that we’re hearing, such as Tweetmeme, Reddit, Google+, and more. This might be just the beginning, I suppose. Voxiq has yet to announce whether it plans to release any public API for the data.

Mozilla plans to make its application on Firefox Web developers’ browsers free for hackers, with the security-as-a-service package priced as a combination of free and paid subscriptions.
Firebug is a small plugin for Firefox Web developers to use to add security to their sites. It costs only $25. It is, however, only available for free, as Mozilla is offering two tiers, $39.99 and $49.99. Firefox’s developers can integrate the plugin and the associated permissions so that the plugin can work on their sites.
Firebug has a free license that is offered by third-party developers. Mozilla says its JavaScript Plugin Plugin will give its users a strong set of security features, but it also offers users more security and control options, such as antivise, block sites, and more. It can also be used with Mozilla’s standard browsers, which it says support the technology in Chrome, Opera, and Opera browsers, and on Windows 8, in Firefox’s Web standard support mode. It will also work on other standards such as XML, JSON, WebID

 and Facebook Messenger, and there they go!
Facebook does all this in the background all day, so it’s a little odd to find an announcement from Facebook on your iPhone in advance of it taking off. The news, however, points to a few things: people think of Messenger as something of a replacement, the Facebook iPhone app is only a bit better because Facebook already has a native app and has been showing off its Messenger SDK in the wild. And it continues Facebook’s quest to get its messaging across to the web.
But this morning, Facebook announced that it will no longer be a third-party messaging app as before, starting June 9th, after Facebook Messenger is finally going to be publicly available."
"It can get pretty expensive to be a tech startup these days if you’re not big enough to have its own standalone website. Zend Framework, the real estate management platform, has taken over the role of its parent, Zend, when co-founder Tom Greenstein leaves.
Zend, you may recall, launched out of a previous product called Holler, its original “Zend for the real estate market,” where homeowners could find the correct agent to help manage their property. While that kind of platform was still very nascent, Greenstein, the son of the founder, says it was “super simple, very elegant.”
Today, it seems that Zend is taking a much more serious tack, with the launch of a new website.
Today, the company will begin managing and helping potential listings, while its technology will continue to iterate faster, it will not necessarily have an exact time frame on when that might occur.
That’s a change from around 2004, when Zend had an initial market for managing small properties, with very basic property management and, most importantly, the ability to manage the money.
Greenstein says that he will continue to operate for a “long time,” and that Zend is still working through that process. And with this new website, you can now see what Zend is working on that in real estate.
For example, a real estate agent could see, say, two properties and be reminded that the real estate agent can also call these agents, too.
These are not new features. Zend has been adding these kinds of features to its main products for some time. The service, which was first launched in 2008, currently allows users to search for the right real estate agent for you, and they could call it, too, which helped the feature become so popular.
“Every day in the market, we’ve got the same issue, so we’ve built a lot of these things around Zend search, and with it this also built a new kind of search platform that lets you find the agent that’s near you, or near you.”


“There’s a bunch of agents that are close to you,” Greenstein told me. “There’s the top dog in town. There’s the realtor with a degree who knows about it. But the top dogs are not close to you, the realtor who knows that you have a home somewhere else is nearby. The whole point is we want everyone in the market to be able to go directly and see everything. And to do that, it means going to the Zend website. We want the site to be absolutely, transparent,” he  said.
Greenstein says this is the first site that Zend has launched out of its own. He says he wanted to open the process as fast and as possible before continuing to grow. Zend is seeing an increase in search of real estate agents.
“There are a bunch of these guys who are close to you that are going to show up a few days after you, and they do a bunch of interviews, then we do those interviews again, and again, and you have all sorts of things like that,” he said. “There’s going to be a lot of people who are not close to you, but are you still going to trust these guys?”
The website will also feature alerts from Zend’s sales people on these new listings, as well as more on the service. (Zend has grown from 250K on April of last year, to 2M on Oct. 1, last year.)
“It’s so much faster than we had before,” Greenstein said. “It’s faster for the whole service. It’s going to help a ton of people who were already using this product before that.”
Today’s the day to launch a standalone website for a platform like Zend, where the company has already built its footprint. “This is the next step in

-growth markets, has more than $5 trillion in funding.
This trend is further amplified at the global level when we are able to compare this to the global VC industry, which is dominated by one set of VCs in the United States. If you only have a few funds per company, and a few of them are actually good, then the overall pool of investments has less than a small fraction of the global pool of investors. Yet, there are a few more tow-tow-companies than there are large companies.
For a country which tends to focus its capital on the tech economy, and the nation’s universities to attract the best technology talent, the fact that the top 10 or so U.S. VCs have more than $5 trillion in funding means that you have a few hundred thousand people working for just two or three companies.
So how do we move towards a more equitable distribution of capital? We can see how we can solve the second-rate problem of over-reimbursing. Instead of relying on a small number of firms to do everything for us, it should be possible for companies to get as much as possible from multiple smaller firms. This has huge implications for the future financial performance of U.S. businesses.
Over the coming years, our current system —which tends to see capital being over hyped, but in reality over-valued — will begin to change. This will change what it takes for a U.S. financial firm to close. Before investing in a U.S.-based company for one, we were investing over and over in companies with no money at all. While the cost of getting overvalued was steep, it was like a drop off into the abyss. Since then, we have lowered the need for more equity; increased competition from elsewhere; brought innovation closer; and created new wealth. For a new economy to succeed, we need the ability to do that and more money.
The reason is that we want to create new opportunities, which requires new talent. The U.S. is already an attractive and well-known nation, with its many technological and financial systems. We could even make the world more competitive in certain markets. While it’s tough to believe, the U.S. is still a country where you have to raise money every time you close a bank. However, the ability to raise money on a much smaller scale, while creating new markets and new opportunities, makes the U.S. far more competitive than ever.
Although the U.S. has the best rates, we’ve already experienced a rapid decline. Today, we have an average rate of 7.5 percent of all U.S. capital investment in global innovation — at the time of the last round for Valor.
On a recent note to analysts, we’re seeing an empire in some of the most important U.S. cities like New York City, which we are now in its second inning. So we are seeing very important new entrepreneurs come through, especially in New York, which leads the world’s markets.
There are new and unique U.S. markets for startups to have massive potential, such as Houston, the city where I grew up, and San Francisco. These are huge places where big startups are coming back to develop. The best cities have more potential and need innovation, just as they need people to learn new skills and develop a new culture.
But there is significant global challenge for the U.S. economy, and we must not allow certain lurid trends. I don’t share the optimism of this trend, which is that for a new generation of entrepreneurs, we no longer have a real choice. We will have to find a way to take advantage of this new reality, to take advantage of our talents and invest more wisely. It’s hard to predict what the future of the U.S. will look like, but it has potential to re-shape the economic landscape for a new era.
The U.S. is still a great market, but our global expansion has started to take a longer-term swing in response to the incremental and more incremental increase in capital and a new generation of entrepreneurs that are ready to work and move out. We can expect to see a new economy in 2016, but it is still not an absolute certainty.
I can safely say that the U.S. is still going through that economic phase. We have a tremendous amount to invest, but so is the world. I do not think that we’re going through economic cycles, but we are going through a period of disruption, and we have the potential and a strong community. We will need a new generation

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 people will be able to add on to things like social and maps, it seems a bit easier to make some of these things directly in the App Store, rather than building them into the SDK itself, which is hard to maintain over the long term.
Here’s how it works: App-developers create a mobile app that is part of a pre-existing app in a few easy steps. First you tap the “Developer Kit” option if you don’t own the app yourself. You’ll then be able to add features and workflows into it from a developer’s platform. Then, when you upload the app to your platform, the new version is supposed to be in the App Store before you can go to change the code.
This seems similar to a similar process for building a new iOS app for iOS 10, if you look at Objective-C. If the new version of the app is in your App Store, you’re supposed to run it. After you’re done playing with it, the new version should be live on your own in the App Store for everyone to download. The process goes all in the back of your mind as you move to see how you’d want to modify a few lines of code.
This method for building in pre-existing iOS apps is actually quite efficient, as all things considered, there is a whole population of developers out there interested in making their services work, and they all want to use their free tools that way. However, to build something on top of that, you’ll need to know Objective-C. Of course, it would be great if all developers didn’t have to learn it. For the few of us that do, it can be useful for developers to share instructions with others about what code to use and what to write, but I would highly recommend that they study Applying Objective-C.
This step is important. Even though this step is really important, most times when you’re running a pre-iOS build, you’re working on an Objective-C app, a new kind of app. You shouldn’t worry about whether your code is an Objective-C code or an iOS developer’s code, you are more concerned about the difference between your code and other, more advanced developers’ apps. It is a good idea for people to understand how to build both, and it is a good way to keep track of the difference between a new Objective-C developer’s code and an iOS developer’s.
Approximately 3 months ago, AppNexus was founded and moved its company to meet, then, the App Store. This article is a great read on some of the basics of AppNexus to help the App Store itself to understand what the API is and what it’s possible to do today.
Finally, you must run an App Store review, or you won’t be able to get this new method. Many companies are going to do this with the existing apps that you’re using to be free in the App Store. If you’re a new app, or not an existing app, the App Store reviews are a great way to start with a clean API to see how the App Store works. After your App Store reviews, you should be able to do this in less than 3 months. Now, every app that we see in the App Store may have one of their developers do so before they are released into the App Store.
This step isn’t done. Every developer, including themselves, is going to have to run some sort of App Store review to verify that there are new releases — and even more often, to verify that those new releases are from different developers.
I think it’s important to learn about Objective-C and to have done it myself. This step, along with taking a step back, is very important, as it helps more developers with testing and it will help them to make sure their App Store release has some kind of standardization, as well as with some kind of code of conduct.
I’m going to go through all of this again on my Twitter.
Disclaimer: This step isn’t necessary, but it’s one that developers in general must undertake. I was able to write most of my Objective-C articles from my Twitter.

"Social gaming companies are becoming more powerful, both at and at the expense of gamers. Social gaming companies have grown to dominate the market, and they now wield incredible power in the gaming world itself. But the power they wield is not all great, and one may argue that gaming companies in general are a little short-sighted, or just that gaming companies, as a whole, are under-funded and that their power to fix this has taken a drastic change. The gaming landscape, however, is still very different today

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 as a regular visitor of social media sites — is today today, launching a new website aimed at its crowd: it’s the first publicly available mobile messaging app that wants to reach the masses via text messaging.
For users a first approach to this new app, the App Store will allow it to be downloaded for free — so, not a paid app — where their payment data is stored. In this case, the app will be billed, as a paid app, and that will be charged according to the number of messages they send. The startup says this is being charged per month per user with no accounting details to its partners (who also receive no free downloads), “and no hidden fees.”
While a paid app will be charged $29/$49/$99 respectively, the App Store’s pricing structure for messaging app is being changed. Apps that previously were in this market to be charged different fees will now be charged one per user per month.
The App Store’s top apps will use a “pay for growth” model to keep their apps afloat. In-game currencies will go into a system that will create new features that will be sold by adding more users over time, along with a system that will allow for paid apps to be discovered and sold through the App Store’s marketplace, too.
The App Store will also be getting a few new tools, such as a new “app scaling” feature, a beta version of its new Google App Exchange, a new reporting options for apps, as well as a new “citizen data” API, to better improve discovery for App Store developers and their customers.
But App Store COO Paul Murphy said that the company has been working a lot on the platform now. “I always wondered what the best place to build apps in a market for developers that are looking for growth, and there was no app market at start.”
So the company has done a lot of that building, and is now excited to now expand to it’s functionality.
In an interview.
TechCrunch: What innovations have the App Store been able to deliver? What have been the key to success on the platform?
Paul Soh: I think the app store has a good thing. There’s a lot of money and a lot of money that’s invested and a lot of money raised from consumers. The people who are out there tend to make sure that it’s good for developers and it’s a good revenue source for developers, it’s been a good way to build a good user base and to monetize that,” we have a lot of that.” “I think it’s important for developers to build an App Store with an App Store that they can have a revenue stream that’s sustainable.”
TechCrunch: Why is the App Store so popular, and are there ever too many competitors?
Soh: We have the App Store because we had the good fortune of first working with the App Store for a long time and we got to be number one in that category, there’s a lot of competition and there’s actually a lot of a lot of new apps coming into the market to be released on the platform and there’s a lot of interesting and a lot interesting things that are happening with the app store we have a lot of that, I think the app store has just become so popular, it’s a huge growth-generating tool.
TechCrunch: Why the App Store has been so successful is that it’s a perfect storm for Android developers. They can easily work with Apple and Microsoft to distribute their own apps, and they get access to the revenue stream from Apple’s App Store. And then when it comes to monetization, Google’s got a monopoly on the market, and so they get access to a lot of the revenue for that store, and they are able to monetize that store through that platform and it’s great for the customers.
TechCrunch: How has being in the App Store helped you sustain your growth?
Soh: We don’t get in a position to plan future things because we don’t know who’s the company that’s going to survive. We look at things and we believe that this is a good place to build it because we believe that the market will grow, and that will eventually change, and then we have to plan for the market.” TechCrunch: Is there a new market or a new market like the App Store, for games and

 users and their partners from making a big mistake.
So I can see the point. After all, why not go ahead and say, as a startup, “we had a big mistake.” Don’t do that now, because it’d be embarrassing. Don’t let that happen because it would be embarrassing.
I’m not saying that there is no room for error on every site — absolutely, I disagree. But that’s not the goal of the project nor is it the goal of the mission. That’s why I say the project should work.
The project is not the real mission, however, it is the result of the idea for a new kind of communication technology that would support the communications of groups and conversations. In particular, it’s not just an idea that we have an alternative to Facebook Messenger. It’s the underlying idea that this is the new way to create online forums for groups of people or specific communities.
The project has started off in a private beta with around 250 people taking part. It’s now taken from $5,500 all the way through $10,000 the founders decided the most valuable part is the ability to create and edit virtual communities for a group of people or communities. Users, if they want to use them, can sign up for the project, or they can create their own.

The other big part is the new platform of the project is the new way for an organization to send out online invites via email, social media, mobile phone and SMS. Once a user has an invitation they’re sent email invites and text reminders, if they want to participate in these virtual communities. And the entire virtual community is then created in the Cloud.
It’s something the founders are working hard at and their backers have put in more time and effort than other projects on YC. The team has developed what looks like an Apache cluster in the UK at a very specific moment and for this reason the crowdfunding campaign was successful. However, the Kickstarter campaign, for the most part, fell apart. The project is now working on a new platform that will allow developers to create their own virtual communities for groups, and also allows the whole of the community to be integrated with the existing infrastructure.

The core concept behind the project is that we see a future where people will be interacting with real and virtual communities to discuss topics, talk about things other communities have shared and learn from projects, videos and other content. By using an interface as streamlined as the ones we are creating today, we are offering users an effective solution for this problem.
The community is also now able to host events — like, a hackathon, or a day of hackathon — on the go by the cloud.
This platform is the core product that will eventually be made available for sale on the market. But, as a startup we think we should also develop and start shipping a new platform and the new community. The only thing, however, that I know is that the project will continue to grow, not diminish.
The company is currently raising a $50,000 Series B round and is planning to ship at the end of the year. That said, the main product plan, like the rest of the project, will become available as a web site. The plans are to be able to create online communities for topics not only ranging from science and history to cooking and cooking, and eventually robotics, robotics or robotics — the projects which already have the same scope of the current Kickstarter project with around 7,000 pledges for a platform with over 1.5 million users.
The new site will be the focal point of the project and the point one might look at when trying to get their project funded.
The current project, if they can pull it off and deliver and make it to their backers (and that’s the goal), will include a brand new, completely redesigned website. The new interface and the new software will be released on the web, as well as as it will be available on the mobile phone and tablet (Android is coming to that in some form). The project has expanded its platform now by bringing together a total of 6,000 community members around topics which have been curated into groups — these are called “Sciences” and can be as broad as the topic may be (e.g. “art”, “technology” or any other topic).

In this sense, the real mission behind the project will be to give people tools to explore their topic and to create their virtual communities around these areas. But the true goal, the team says, is to create a new platform to create a place for people to collaborate in a real-time community.
The platform is being used this week by a group of the startup’s advisors, and by some sources with knowledge of the project says that one of the advisors, Michael Brehm, may have been

 be a first step in a broader strategy to grow those business over new areas, and also to build out a business that will stand out against competitors.
The other area where things should remain relatively straightforward is in the area of product, but for the most part that is simply a matter of how quickly and how well the product can be mass‑produced. For Apple, for example, the new device launches are a significant event — one of the first of the company’s devices that comes with new Touch technology, and they will probably feature prominently in the iTunes lineup itself, too.
For what it’s worth, the Surface Pro will also be sold as part of a new hardware section of the iTunes App Store, and Apple will sell the original Surface hardware.
The good news for fans of these announcements is that, although it sounds like there are plenty of new products out there in the works that might, too, these will certainly be sold and support for them is crucial for the company’s continued survival. (And, of course, all of this is still very early; it’s too early to say just how they sell, and how their customers will react to them, but it remains to be seen.)
So whether there is to see a renewed interest in its product in its new form, or simply just simply being able to see other people saying, “Thank you Apple.” Maybe even one day a whole new one of these “what to wear” announcements that will go with that."
"When I say that we have been witnessing a “slowly but surely” Apple (a company that has historically generated major product changes within the space of the living room) and the new generation of mobile platforms have been slow but surely, it’s not really the best comparison.
For years now, the major players have been doing the same thing.
But, even the most casual consumer may know that Apple is rapidly rolling out new features with those operating systems. The company has been slow and steady, and the new iPhones and iPad are proof beyond a shadow.
The new iPhone and iPad, while, technically a “new” device running newer software with the same specs, they’ve also become the newest symbols of slowing change. It’s time to look at the new ones.
Let’s start with the iPhone and iPad — not only is the new generation different, but so is the new device itself. For a lot of the first generation, Apple had a very different device. If you’d say to call them a “new,” it would be an overpriced device that had the same form factor as the previous generation — the iPhone. The iPad, on the other hand, was a premium device with a new face.
The iPod had the form factor and the form factor.
The new MacBook had the form factor, the form factor.
On the latter side of the equation, new devices like the Mac mini and the new 13-inch Retina MacBook have made Apple’s notebook and tablet lines look as if they were plucked from the ether by an old school electronics giant. But, if you add in the fact that they had only one face, it’s still the same notebook.

The new iPad, on the other side of the equation, features a new form factor — a tablet form factor. As it happens to be the case, there is no reason to believe that the iPad-type model — the iPad mini — will still be sold as such.
To be fair, the first generation of iPads, with hardware specs that would make them stand out on their own, could have had a better shelf life. The new iPad, on the other side of the equation, has a shelf life of less than 2 years — that of the new 14-inch Retina MacBook.
I personally think the new iPad will be sold at all costs (or even a “very limited price”). But even if it were available at a discount, it wouldn’t really matter. A 2-year-old with a new and shiny 10 dollars to spend on a new notebook? I would pick that tablet before a full-sized 13-inch tablet. (I used to.)
But, in terms of price, the new iPad is simply too damn close to the new Retina MacBook — a mere $130 (or even $100 less). And, the new iPad will likely only sell a few thousand in the first few weeks. In short, the new iPad is just too good for the new MacBook.
The bottom line is that consumers have a lot of expectations. What they get out of those expectations, more often than not, is the same thing that they expected: an inexpensive device that has a few very nice features, but otherwise, has the same overall function and is just as attractive as a new model.
I know I’

 increase. It could, it could become a good deal for everyone as the world is getting more comfortable with these devices."
"Facebook will now allow users to search photos using the search-based feature on the desktop version of Android, iOS and Mac devices. Now there’s the new mobile search feature available on some mobile devices with iOS, with iOS 8.1 update rolling out quickly.
There’s also the new mobile sharing feature, which allows sharing to groups and friends, and there’s the full photo-sharing icon in the Facebook app now. Facebook has not said yet if it will make this feature available on the desktop, but it’s on iOS as well.
One of the most popular feature features in Facebook’s mobile applications is its mobile photo search feature for browsing photos, which lets users search the photos they find most interesting. That feature, originally called Find Friends, is now getting a redesign, according to a Facebook blog post that has a nice nicely similar design.
This new search-based option is likely a key feature from a privacy perspective, as the data being provided is not just being used to improve the speed with which it can index photos, or improve things like how fast it can index photos, according to the post.
Facebook said it had been testing this feature with a number of partners, including BuzzFeed and CNN, for example, in its iOS application, and noted that it didn’t see a significant uptick in traffic during testing by relying on friends, groups, users or users to share photos after its redesign.
The feature was added to mobile in February 2015 with the introduction of its desktop application. With the desktop app, users can do more things like search photos, search for a photo of a friend, use the new mobile sharing feature, and more. Facebook has released a bunch of new features on Windows, Mac, Android and the Web during the past 12 months, and a more complete set of desktop profiles for the desktop version with Facebook Photos.
Other new features with the new desktop app include the search bar at bottom, which can be moved anywhere in the top bar — though, for instance, where users could have used the Search bar in the last release in December."
"It’s a wild world out there for “personal assistants” and apps that give you information before you even need it. The new ‘AI-powered’ personal assistant called “Tinder” is one such example, after it was founded by two Stanford computer scientists that have been using Android to develop the technology.
“We were able to show that it would actually be able for a service as simple as messaging, for example. And it would be able for a service as simple as messaging,” said Jonathan Fisher in a call to TechCrunch.
“We showed that when we combined the features with something along with the search feature, we really made a killer product.”
The Tinder technology, which works inside the Chrome OS, is already used by the likes of Spotify and HBO for their personalized service for music discovery and listening.
This will also be available within the Facebook Messenger app which allows people to chat with other humans based on their search queries.
When asked which applications and services the AI-powered assistant will ultimately run on, Facebook said that it’s not taking a stance because “Tinder will be used by the majority of our users.”
Fisher and Hsieh have previously worked together on projects for Google and Facebook, the latter having acquired the former for $500 million this summer. But with the app already in testing, Fisher and Hsieh have no plans to invest more in Tinder right now.
“This is not the first time that we have had interaction with bots, not just for music but also entertainment,” said Fisher. “And I’m definitely looking for ways to enhance it.”

That’s also because the pair have their own expertise in how to code on the programming side, and have previously built a machine-learning tool to help to solve problems at their own homes.
“We’ve built up quite a bit of code, and already it has already been translated a few different places, into people as young as three,” said Fisher, referring to the current translation in the Tinder website and website app. “And even some parts of the source code for the algorithm have already been translated. So it’s a good starting point. But I’m not sure if we can start to see more applications right now if we really want to do a more sophisticated version.”
When asked whether Tinder’s AI will be a service that will be available as a freemium option, Fisher said they

 active to deliver content to their users. 
” We’ve been very deliberate in design the experience,” he says of the feature and the user interface, as well. “The experience is very personalised. People are very unique.”
The company is very early and is aiming for early adopters here as a tool set for media publishers and video creators — although it’s also going after the traditional ad and content publishers as well, as well.
“To be honest I believe that most of the big brands are going to be using this solution, and I think we’re not going to wait for that to come out and say why is it the right way,” he adds.
One other area where The Current is on to the left-hand-way is with video, with The Current being more interested in creating and distributing branded channels for users to find and watch content from multiple sources in a media-rich way. 
“Our primary focus. When you are doing media, you need all the power of data because you can’t live without it,” he says, adding : “We’ve talked to media people and publishers and got them asking us to be a third-party aggregator so that they could do their part to do this.”
There’s no sign of Auctable in developing its existing native ad and content or anything. The service will be a cross-device solution and be based on the ability of publishers and video creators to make their content available to users in the form of video ads or the creation of video playlists, or in-stream advertising. 
The Current is also trying to create a solution for publishers for video where users can embed their videos, but that isn’t there yet. Its focus is more on content creators."
"Foursquare CEO Dennis Crowley will be stepping down from the company soon, according to a new report from BusinessWeek. Crowley told a room of execs gathered on stage at its “Today” show that he would step down at some point, according to several insiders speaking to Fortune.
That’s how we've been hearing (but are working on), and we’ve reached out to Crowley to get more information about his plans for the next few weeks.
When asked by Fortune, he wouldn’t confirm the details, he said: “At our company we’re just getting started. I don’t have time to do this stuff more often but it’s an interesting and interesting change. It’s time to move on.”
His reasons behind why he wouldn’t want to move on sooner than later, Crowley told Fortune: “I don’t feel it’s right, as far as my age and age range and ability is where I actually excel.”
When asked if he was currently considering leaving the company, Crowley said he still has work to do. That’s part of why he decided to leave soon after he was cut and replaced, according to sources speaking to the New York Times.
He’s been around since 2005 and is considered more of a general partner, having invested about $150 million in the startup and co-founded it with Ben Silbermann and a few others.
One of the biggest investors in The Current is the team and the New York Times. The Current is now known as The Verge and has been around for about nine months. There have been some big changes within the company — including new CEO Andrew Mason, who was a co-CEO and co-founder, and an earlier CEO and founder Sven Odall along with a co-director, Michael Lefkofsky, who stepped down with the rest of the company (which then became the Current).
The Current is still an independent company, and has been growing steadily. Last quarter the service added around 100,000 daily active users, and reached about one million on iOS and Android (in a few months).
The current is still at a relatively small (at around 5 million in terms of user cap), though the company recently raised $13.5 million in Series B funding from Khosla Ventures and Tiger Global.
There are two bigger trends that The Current sees: rising usage among consumers, and more and more data use among individuals. This is of huge concern for consumers (to the point where they are starting to question the future of the entire American economy).
While this is a fundamental shift from previous decades, the user base is still small. In fact, The Current has about 100,000 subscribers now, up significantly from the 5 million the company has three months ago."

 idea of their next great idea or product idea.”
There are more than 300,000 people in India at least in the workforce and about 20 million products in the country, according to estimates released last week by Indian market research company Apsalar Research.
And with the increasing power of mobile phones, mobile internet, and new markets emerging around the world where the smartphone age has clearly made people very attractive employees, this isn’t necessarily the last we’ll see an aging veteran in a new company.
“We may see people looking over his shoulder or taking a look over his shoulder,” Srinivasan said. “But if you see him in a room or chair, you know you have to be there, not just to be there, but also to take the seat, or to have the power of mind and voice. That’s a power that people don’t have to have for long because they would lose a lot on the world if they had to lose them all.”
He emphasized the importance of understanding the people in your company. “In terms of power in your company, you always know when employees do something on the big board that would be detrimental to your business,” he said. What’s that? A board member who would be detrimental if they had to have his or her seat in the board room or chair in the boardroom could, for example, be a problem. It’s important that employees understand the ramifications.
“As long as the employees are able to focus on their business, you can always do well with one another,” he said. “There’s a difference between a good relationship and not a bad. It’s the difference between a great opportunity for a job that will make us better at the next level versus the risk of losing a good one.”"
"Mobile payments solution Paytm has launched a new way for shoppers to pay from their phone. It works in conjunction with an online payment card reader and uses a magnetic stripe reader to make card payments using cash, card, card cash, debit card payment, credit mobile, and NFC payment. The new app lets the mobile wallet card reader, the magnetic stripe reader, and the cash payment card reader all work together in a wallet using mobile phone and a magnetic stripe chip. This isn’t the first time a pay bill has been integrated to mobile phones.
The new way to pay from mobile phones has been in development for the past few years but its launch was the first thing the company did when it turned to secure partnerships to get things up and running. The company started off with some simple hardware and then added different smart hardware components such as a coin-chip reader and a cash payment card reader. The new way of paying doesn’t look like anything that anyone else has done yet, but the idea will be an important tool to integrate in a wallet that can potentially be a valuable gateway to mobile payments. It’s all about making the process smoother and not requiring new software.
The key to integrating mobile payments into your wallet is not the technology but how it works. Paytm is a device agnostic wallet for smart phones. It can also be used as a gateway to payments via fiat cards in other countries.
Paytm says it has done “over 7 million transactions” on its platform in the last year and that the company sends approximately $50 million in payments a month across more than 100,000 cards.
A new Android and iOS mobile wallet, powered by Paytm, is due later this month with early buyers."
"Mobile World Congress is on one side and, on the other side, a flurry of new phones running with Android software, from Google, Facebook and others. We will probably all know more about which is which between now and the show this week. Mobile World Congress 2015 is the World of Mobile Conference.
This year’s conference runs every year, in the heart of the mobile era, in Barcelona, near the main rail link.
This year’s conference is bigger than its predecessor. The first year it plans on running every round in one place, with over 30,000 tickets to the conference. In 2015 it will run 3.4 million tickets for that round, so a lot of people there, even in 2016, will be able to make their way through some of the conference. 
2016 marks the first conference the conference has organized entirely on mobile, with the first conference at WWDC last year, and that will continue into 2016, too.
Mobile conferences are becoming much more about mobile than a mobile conference. This is a major turning point when it comes to mobile events today. The last two weeks of WWDC will be all about mobile phones, as the conference was a meeting on

 and their social graph. This is an important area for developers to invest in — and it’s a big one to monitor.
That said, it’s still early for the team. “As we look at how much information is buried amongst all the posts in your stream, and the links that are just links in the stream, and the people you follow, that data becomes really useful,” explains Blin. The idea is that it can get smarter over time, and maybe even use that information to improve your Feed — so maybe that post in the thread you’ve been sharing or the next one you’ll post to?
The company also says it has some early-stage investors, so there are probably some opportunities waiting for them along the path.
At one point in the interview, in fact, the interviewer made a joke about Google buying Facebook. (After all, the search giant bought Twitter in March for its enterprise efforts. And we wrote about Google’s new product-oriented acquisition of Periscope.)
“I think Google has bought us already,” says Blin."
"Atomico, the mobile payments startup building its platform on-demand, is adding several new features following a $1.3 million seed round. The first of these are new “super fast” payment methods that Atomico and its own merchant clients need to use all the time. And we’ve added a few new products to help retailers better use their existing inventory in order to expand.
While the on-demand payments space is starting to mature, the question is whether it’s going to be able to continue growing in the same way as it is from a very much early stage perspective. There are already a couple dozen different payment methods out there, but even there are some very interesting ones.
We’ve got to check out this service ourselves and see which ones are growing up. That said, we also spent some time with Atomico’s CEO and Founder Mike Avila this week. The round comes from David Tisch, 500 Startups, Ron Conway, and others. The firm has just hired the four-man, San Francisco-based team, and they’ll be handling everything between customer service and business development, including customer support. Avila says they’ve had three percent of Atomico’s entire bank capital to date.
This also looks to be the beginning of a very big growth cycle for Atomico, which has already brought in an impressive amount of money from investors, but hasn’t been able to grow past three percent yet. Avila says he thinks that’s thanks to the fact that many customers are going to be moving towards online commerce, but he also points out that there’s more to come on the market soon, and that it’s something that he’ll be focused on keeping in mind as he looks for other growth on the market.
What that means for the rest of us is that Atomico is looking to make the product experience more convenient (and less cluttered) than it is. Right now, the company offers instant access to most financial services like your bank account, your home mortgage, and your car’s worth of value. But Avila says he’ll be more interested in more immediate, on-demand care that comes in a couple of days and fits nicely under the banner “On Demand.” 
But even though this is going to be a much more immediate way of receiving the service, customers will be able to save and make online purchases right on the site. Avila says that this will also be important for online retailers, as they see customers who have already made offline purchases already and who want the same instant access when they also need to go online.
This is just the beginning of what Atomico may eventually do on the platform, as well as further developing its own retail store offering. It sounds like a lot of things will come from the site, though. Avila would not reveal what those will be, but he did mention that the company is working on a “sales experience marketplace for retailers.” That’s a good idea, but how will it look like when and if customers can buy online on such short notice? We’ll need more time to see, because it will definitely be a very exciting month for the company.

The other thing that’s going to be interesting is that it looks like we’ll see a lot of new products coming from Atomico, which is also making sure that the platform is flexible enough for various clients to use, while still still staying clean with user experience. That could lead to some interesting innovations that the company will look at. 
Avila said that the startup’s other products will also come over in a couple of weeks, and they’

 of its users on social networks. Its mobile advertising platform aims to take advantage of that by aggregating the best available sources of sponsored content into a mobile-optimized app.
It is the platform that will see the most growth in total ad views worldwide and the most ROI in that, according to AdMob’s CEO and founder, Paul Sager. He says “our global expansion plan is very straightforward,” especially for countries like Brazil. That’s because there are a lot of users in Brazil and the U.S. and there are some big marketing advantages there.
While the world is still figuring out out social video, it’s definitely the market that is on its way to becoming the next big thing in video.
And AdMob is doing just that."
"Microsoft said yesterday that it will soon begin removing the Microsoft Mobile Ads from the Windows Phone Store, a service that let developers distribute and promote promotions offered through Microsoft’s mobile apps alongside the mobile web version of their content. This follows an announcement from Microsoft back in August, which inked a deal with ad network Hootsuite.
The move was made as part of a wider push to offer mobile ad-supported content that isn’t associated with specific applications on its platform to give them a more prominent place across the apps that its platform has become.
The company said in August that it would begin selling “clear video”, a format and delivery solution based on video, on Windows Phone through a new, dedicated app storefront, and that soon after that, it would begin showing ads directly in that store (via a mobile app icon that now appears when clicking on the mobile ad-related section of the app store).
The move will likely cause some of its more serious customers in that category of apps to move to another app store. Microsoft and others have been busy promoting themselves and offering an App Store for the iPhone and Android through developer partners like Hootsuite and others, and it comes at a time when Microsoft is working to promote a more comprehensive, advertising-centric strategy with apps that will offer advertising to users outside of Windows Phone.
Hootsuite, which offers services designed to help developers tap out mobile user interaction data, said at the time that Microsoft is one of its first partners in “a partnership with [Microsoft] to bring the best of the best content and experience to Windows Phone users.”
The new announcement follows on from that deal and marks the end of Mobile Ads in the Apps Store as a standalone service that will no longer function as a standalone service. That also follows on from the company’s announcement last month of the launch of a dedicated ad-supported ad format in the mobile video site — now, the company has been a brand, for all intents and purposes, of the App Store. In fact, it was actually a new company.
Hootsuite, which has been around for a while now and has expanded into digital video — in the U.S., the largest market for its ads — announced back in July that it had made an acquisition of another mobile video ad network, Tadaa, a maker of high-definition, app-optimized video ads.
Hootsuite had been around since 2008, and is best known for its high-definition, video ads that let users browse through videos based on user activity. The Tadaa deal is significant for the company, since it extends beyond its core user base in the U.S. market, and will put it on board with some of the biggest platforms across the world.
Tadaa, which was backed by $26 million in a Series D last year, has in total run more than 12 billion video ads.
It’s important to Microsoft to use its name to refer to itself as a platform for video advertising, since it’s more associated with apps than any other service. Microsoft has a big head-start, but Tadaa’s ad business is also a big deal for Tadaa, so it looks like Microsoft is trying to become a more prominent platform for ad-based ad-supported video ads on Windows Phone devices.
At the same time, Microsoft says that it will continue to serve Tadaa ads in mobile video games itself, and that it will continue to build up its global TV broadcast network."
"A few days after the Paris court ordered Facebook to remove a fake news story from its website, the search giant has yet to comment publicly on the ruling.
We have contacted the search giant for more information and will update with any response.

 (and it’s only now shipping into its third country): it offers free data, for the very same price that its bigger, paid plan. But if you do that well, then Free data starts off with data you’re paying. 

And as an aside: that’s the exact same logic that is why Uber and Lyft don’t work. They don’t offer free stuff that you’re willing to pay (because if FreeData can be free, then why not?), and it would be hard to imagine that other services can follow that lead.
In this case, with FreeDatacrack, people will be able to save up to a whole bunch of credits for a fixed period of time. The company tells me at this point that it’s seeing 500 transactions per day, and that it’s growing faster than five-digit percent month-over-month growth on a rolling basis. The company’s last funding, in December 2012, saw them growing 5 percent month over month, and that they’re seeing 40 percent week-over-week growth, growth is now at 28 percent week-over-month.
Now it will be interesting to see whether that speed of service gains popularity when people actually need it. That’s not to say that FreeDatacrack isn’t growing, it has been a while so that this could become a more significant option than it had ever grown before.
But right now, we’re talking about an Uber for credit carriers who didn’t see you coming. Or Uber, for the credit carriers who didn’t see you coming. Maybe that’s why the company is moving into this business.
The idea? Get paid in real life. In fact, the service is part of a bigger trend among people – we are living in a world of mobile where it’s now normal to be more than willing to pay for goods in real life. It’s the power that people may have, whether they are in their wallet or in mobile phone, and it’s what they would do on the phone and receive.
FreeDatacrack’s approach is a new way to get the same power from those people who may not necessarily be driving on a regular basis – and may not be paying Uber, Lyft, or other people – and that could become a very valuable service to have. And that’s why the company is moving on into this business – to build out Uber cash"
"Mobile-first, cloudless, and always connected devices have been making waves lately, but the mobile-plus-clouds angle has been largely ignored by the mainstream for the last few years. Just look at the trend in wireless data usage.
A mobile device that can be recharged by plugging in and powering up is a mobile device that plugs in and powers up, and hence the cloudless tweak to describe a mobile device in this post. When push comes to shove, it’s Apple’s iOS 6, Google’s Android, and Samsung’s Galaxy Note III, and the inevitable rise in market share that we’ve created in mobile devices. But those devices aren’t the only mobile device available. Apple’s iPod, and Samsung’s Galaxy Note III, aren’t just devices. They’re just platforms with which we plug devices. And they’re also phones, tablets, TVs, routers, and other connected devices.
But the internet-connected device trend continues. That trend goes on. That trend is now taking shape, as devices integrate more cloud data and sensors like the iPhone 5S, LG G Flex 2, and the Samsung Galaxy A5. It may even be the beginning of a new, mobile-only paradigm.
Consider the example of the Samsung Galaxy Note III’s user interface. The big reveal that users can plug in and power up their device — the Galaxy A5 — simply by tapping a button that appears at the bottom of their Galaxy A3 device and charging up their Galaxy A3 devices. The Galaxy Note III features Samsung’s Smart Home, Smart Hub, and Smart Assistant — all of which plug into the Galaxy A3 via a micro USB port, and make it easy for users to make their phone their primary interface.
Smart Hub, meanwhile, allows users to use a cloud-based device assistant that comes from their Galaxy Galaxy A5. Samsung’s Cloud Assistant does an interface that takes control of an Android smartphone to do a task when you’re out of range. This is important for smart devices and not only Apple’s iPhone 5S, and it’s a trend that Samsung is well-positioned to exploit. And it’s also part of Samsung’s larger push to expand into other types of devices and also

�s new feature called Snap-To-Tweet. You simply click an “About Me” button and you can share your location with others. When you’re about 500th in a tweet, it automatically displays the top five places that you went last night.
“The app is just perfect for those of us who live so far away. It’s a great way to share my favorite experiences around random things I love,” said Jason Baptiste, founder at Vibes. That’s exactly what people do, he explained. “I don’t need to say, ‘I went out and bought a beer with some friends,’ because you can just see through my eyes at the moment.”
The new features should make a big difference because users can choose to only share on those moments where they feel like they were the part of the story, with a bit less of self-promotion.
While the “About Me” feature has been designed to be more subtle than the big, green buttons above each location, there was a time when it was hard to believe that the one-minute-exchange-or-less-revenue-share-window-type would take such a sweet time. Now, users can click through a link to read further stories on a story they like, or the person can click the button and enter your own.
Of course, when an article goes viral, one user is not going to share because of a weird, random story, but the following day or a month after the “about-to-about-me” story, they will be sharing it for the first time.
You can get the Snapchat Story app here."
"We were skeptical – but not stupid – when Facebook released Facebook Stories in November.
A new Facebook app has popped up called Moments, which presents a curated feed of stories curated by the Facebook Friends team. Moments posts can feature a video, photo, quote, link or editorial from the Huffington Post, ESPN, VICE, Buzzfeed, Business Insider and others.
Moments even has a Twitter feed of your reaction.
Some of the bigger brands in the Moments feed include ESPN (especially in the video-related section), ESPN, Forbes and CNN. Others that have appeared in the Moments feed include TechCrunch, ABC News and The Huffington Post.
Facebook is playing to its strengths – it helps us talk publicly. In the last 24 hours, 10 million people have posted to Facebook, a record for Facebook and a new day. In just 15 minutes, we shared a video, photo, quote, link, video, recipe, recipe – that last one was shared in less than 10 minutes.
The beauty of Moments is that it’s limited – the Feed only shows Moments in English, unless it features the language of one of the more prominent languages: Spanish.
The app also features an editor section that highlights other languages. It’s the first step Facebook is taking to broaden engagement. Moments also has a feed of thousands of stories from around the web, so you can check out some other apps below which have their own full Facebook accounts. These have an even more narrow focus and may be harder to find. 
[Note: I was alerted to the app’s existence by a commenter named @lauristin , but the actual download link for the Moments feed is this one, not this one with an English version.]
I’ve just started to play with the app, and I haven’t seen much of a shift in usage, though people in other languages might find the Pages as a little soothing.
Facebook launched Moments in November 2011, and today came a big update which adds support for more languages, better image quality, support for GIFS, improved search, better search results, a “recently Viewed” drop-down with trending stories from your friends and people you like on the home page, better news integration, and faster loads on the iPhone where it had struggled because of the high latency issues some Pages have at 1.2 gigabits per second.
After two years of building out its social network from a simple app, to integrating every feature that Facebook has under its hot, sticky surface, Moments looks somewhat more polished. It’s also a nice upgrade from Timeline, which I found to be a waste of my time. You can see the full version here below.

Moments is a free app that gets updated every 24 hours. You’ll need to be a Facebook user after four hours. It’s still in beta, and it looks like it will remain in beta for the foreseeable future. If you want to try it out, tap on this link from Facebook’s Pages Developer site."

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 you-know-it-all-when it comes to video, there’s something special about what the company has been doing. And one of the key ways they’ve been doing that is by combining that with a bunch of other technologies. When they say that they’re the world’s largest ad network, they’re really just talking about data. When they say that, it starts to have a profound impact to business models.
But in order to give you an example, AdParlor is also known as the Twitter of advertising, a network that serves ads on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit, YouTube — you name it. And it’s still growing. AdParlor says that it’s growing at 37 percent month over month. They had nearly 25 million users in June. And they’ve been growing steadily.
So if you want your business model, you’ve gotta go with analytics and reporting. And the reason that AdParlor has been successful is something that CEO and CTO Mark Henrion said is “we’re not just analyzing people in their web browser.” There’s an important reason — he said that Ad parlor is actually measuring their analytics in desktop and mobile browsers.
In the beginning, AdParlor was all about tracking the number of users who were on it through browser tabs. They used something like that to figure out, “OK, I’m a small app app, but I’m still using Safari Safari so it’s a small app. I’m still using Safari. In the last two quarters, I’ve been getting at an 80 percent reduction on those figures.”
But now he said that most other ad networks have an ad unit called a user agent that they analyze. And they typically have to have an API that they can plug in. So if a user agent came in and plugged in AdParlor, they’d have to plug it back in. In just 60 seconds, the company says users are seeing a 40 percent boost in revenue per user agent. And of course with the growth in growth analytics, AdParlor has been adding user agents in rapid succession."
"Google is currently working on a new patent application to describe how its search engine could integrate with other companies to help bring advertising to other devices, and Google today confirmed that news when it published a blog post on its own blog.
Specifically, Google’s patent describes how ads could be injected into products you might use on other devices, such as your home, your tablet and your car. This is not a Google invention; it’s something that Google is working on as a matter of patent.
What I don’t understand is why anyone but Google would want to write about this. I don’t know who else would do such a thing — if a company would come over with advertising, why would Google bother with it? (In this post, Google did mention that Google is now collecting more information about how other businesses integrate with Google Search.)
It’s still early in terms of how this could be implemented — perhaps Google could integrate in-house with other companies like Apple. (For what it’s worth, Microsoft and Android were both already talking last week.)
But for what it’s worth, I’ll update if I hear more.
Update: You can also browse the patent directly from Google, which reminds me of the other time that my IP was discovered as an embarrassing, patent-tortured device at an Apple event. The other time — probably the first time for me to share the blog post — was with my own blog post. There was the first issue, that there was a patent application. And there were a large number of questions, the answers — all very Google-y.
There’s Google’s Android’s own open source Google Android implementation and Microsoft’s Windows 8. I believe that I don’t have to re-post that post to my own blog. I just go in and re-blog it today. The first thing that’s useful about it is that it seems to be fairly consistent with the blog post. (Oh, and here’s hoping the Microsoft attorneys think of these patents as a reasonable excuse to put the screws to Google.)
I also feel that it doesn’t really matter which patent Google published, so don’t worry about that. If it wasn’t Google’s, you could imagine Google getting sued for patent infringement for what it said in the blog post.
What is interesting is Google’s patent says something about how the company “may be able to provide advertising within a public venue.” This could include events and exhibitions and things that Google has planned to do. That could be an interesting thing for Google

 to have to use Gmail, the main email and contacts app that Google launched in 2009.
If Google can take a page out of Facebook’s business approach and use that social graph in its own email applications, it has the potential to help itself grow faster just as its ad products have grown over the last 10 years.

"Last summer, social app developer and social media company Instagram announced its acquisition of photo-sharing startup Strava, in an effort to capitalize on a growing need among consumers for apps that allow them access to celebrities’ content, concerts and other events, while enabling them to use the company’s other services in an easier way.
Now, it’s launching its public beta today, with the public debut of a new product called Photowatch, which also offers a way to keep track of other photos, even if they’re not being shared by, say, celebrities themselves.
“Innovating in user engagement metrics and user growth can help companies keep up with celebrities’ needs,” notes Anthony, a long-time, active user of Instagram, who was previously the chief product officer of Twitter. “What we’re seeing as social media users – photographers and media companies – is how they’re using tools like Instagram and Twitter, and how they use those tools, to keep up with their needs.”
The idea, Anthony says, is to use technology, in addition to existing social features, will get to “build a better photo experience for the artist.” While this may seem like a relatively simple example, Anthony notes that this actually means that “photographers can be more creative with the content they choose, and how they want to promote that content.” 
But like other “user engagement” apps, such as Strava’s, these are just a few of the features in the App Center “photography”, or “photographer” which he says will become available to third party developers in the future.
The idea here is to offer some sort of platform for artists to capture and share other shots with their followers, while also trying to give a way to users to capture even more of their own content when they do eventually end up on their own.
“I’ve been collecting some of my own photos, with friends, and they’ve been kind of hard to find,” says Anthony. “We’re not an image platform or a social network,” he adds, adding that he would be interested in more companies using the platform for that purpose as their own user engagement platform.
He says he had already been working on a number of different things about his own Instagram account, but when he realized that there were more than a handful of other photographers using Instagram photos, he’s come full circle in that regard.
In fact, the Instagram acquisition made him look to other photographers for inspiration, like the photographer behind the Instagram photos for Gangnam Style, and the photographer behind the Instagram photos which was shared with the group’s fans last spring. In that case, the photographer had captured many of the photos on their own using a standard workflow, while Instagram has done some of the bulk work.
There were some potential competitor apps out there, in particular after Instagram, which acquired Bump, for $350 million, in 2008. As we’ve noted, Instagram has been trying to take advantage of its social graph for the past few weeks, to let people share photos of their own things with each other. That means users could already use Instagram’s existing APIs, but, at least in that regard, they may no longer necessarily need to.
Meanwhile, a series of related announcements from a number of brands in October, which is still ongoing, have encouraged new app developers to take a more active role in terms of the community.
For the past year now, the Instagram app has been being built and maintained by the Advisory Board, which consists of 12 people. But there are other changes that have been made under the Advisory Board’s direction, according to Anthony, that could see the building of new partnerships: “We’re also talking about better advertising on the Instagram web, and what’s the marketing strategy going to be, how that product will get out there, how that product will be in the market, how that product will be used, how that product will be promoted, and how that product will sell.”
He is also looking out more. In the past, advertising that was focused on just the app, but now it could include other services like video advertising in areas where users are looking for more content

 significant when it comes to sales — the kind aimed at the company’s goal of becoming the world’s first e-commerce company to be profitable, in 2013, according to the startup’s CEO, Fabriz Bensadon. And, as a result, the company was chosen, along with other companies, as part of a contest led by VTB, a German-founded accelerator.
We’ll see. If you’re wondering why it took more than a week to make this jump, well, here’s how Bensadon explained in a company blog post.
“It took us almost a week to make our decision, but we chose the winners,” he said.
While a number of the finalists were from local groups rather than global corporations like Amazon and Walmart, VTB will still work with other companies and “we’ve signed contracts in order to take part in the competition.”"
"With Twitter in a bit of a picker mode lately, it was somewhat surprising that Twitter’s former CEO Dick Costolo, who has a long history of making strategic moves to expand Twitter’s product and push it into more usage, decided to strike yet more of those strategic deals today.
Today at a tweet-a-thon we have news we’ll be able to enjoy for a bit. The Twitter of Today service will be shut-down on August 17th, and the app is going to revert to version 1.0, where it would appear that there were some new features that Twitter will be calling its Twitter Cards service. But, as of today, there is nothing to discuss about those new features, except that they appear to be getting rolled out publicly this weekend.
A spokesperson from Twitter told us that it was difficult to find out if there would be any new cards on the launch of Twitter Cards, because the service has been undergoing testing internally and has not been ready yet, and they may not be ready publicly until later in summer, depending on how fast progress is made. Still, there will be some new cards for use with Twitter’s new feature “Twitter Cards” available sometime next week, which seems to go with the relaunch of Twitter’s public app as a service.
As of May, Twitter was rolling out a few small features that did catch the attention of some people: the ability to follow a variety of account-wide or Twitter-focused events, while the ability to track news about events shared by others.
As with the other new features that are arriving publicly this weekend, the ability to follow events has not yet been fully turned on, in any case.
On the same hand, it’s not clear what the “latest” number of Twitter’s apps will be, since at this point not even a new API.
A number of its older features have been returning, like “Tweeting” and Twitter’s new “Tweets” feature for Twitter Cards.
Twitter’s new search feature, for example, has not yet been rolled out publicly.

For a look at what Twitter’s new cards look like (pre-roll here), check out this link:"
"As a result of launching its public beta today, Twitter has released a new version of its product that brings an interface across all of its properties. Now, all users with @-ed their follower count will be able to follow all followers. It’s not all good news. Twitter is also making itself more discoverable to users on mobile, and rolling out new “Social Feed” analytics that will help it better show engagement and growth to users.
Also interesting is that Twitter is adding links that take users directly to Twitter’s pages in mobile apps like Facebook, Pinterest or Twitter’s own mobile app. That makes sense, as a user is essentially buying Twitter ads, at least in the sense, that the ads are designed to drive traffic to Twitter’s site. The link-browsing interface should be easy for users. For those that aren’t at Twitter yet, this appears to be a sign they will not have to join in the beta group, given the links that take users to Pinterest’s page.
The other issue? The interface has changed with the debut of Twitter’s new mobile apps. Now, users can simply tweet any user with the question “@mention” (e.g. the username of the Twitter account that sent the tweet or the hashtag) to their followers. The app will then show “Interest-Related Posts” at the top of the stream that shows the top 10 users you follow who retweeted the tweet, and also the new “Follow” feature in the top of the feed to let you follow the people who retweeted your own tweets.

 coaching, it’s hard to get them into the room before you. It’s even harder to get a job if you’re a doctor and you’re a consultant.
For a company to do a great job, it has to understand the “real world” of entrepreneurship and business. Let’s say you get a big company on the phone and the person has an idea about a new business you want to help create — you’re still looking around. The person might go from being a “career expert” in a particular field to having it in his business plan. You might have a dozen employees and your company plans to go big with a few interns while hiring all these people from another company. The company wants to hire everybody and your consultant wants to go from one of those to three. What do you do? Well, you’re not looking for a big company — it wants a good junior to build a great enterprise. The person has two options. You either decide to go the other way and try to find an additional small company.
You might also take a “traditional” route and you decide to go the “software-as-a-service” approach. You don’t have to sign up to a specific suite of software. You instead integrate it but by making a huge transformation from a small company to a big company, you might be able to bring the company’s product without adding any technical expertise. For those people, you can start a new company from scratch, or you join a existing company. Finally, you might take another approach — you might join a traditional enterprise company and then go it alone to establish yourself in the market that you want to disrupt.
There are three things that a great entrepreneur can look for in the process of establishing an enterprise. The core issues are solving a problem in order to create a market with a large market player. The company that’s doing this well is probably the only one that could create a very large market and a huge company like that is unlikely to be created. (It should also be noted that startups that are successful are in every case growing because of a lack of resources and capital that can support these companies.) If you’ve found that out when I looked at business models, I recommend a “software-as-a-Service business.”
If you’ve made all the right moves, you’ve established yourself in some form of a market and you’re able to create a very large market and a very large company. For that, it is all about executing on a plan rather than executing on a plan. If you execute on a plan and your plan doesn’t succeed, well, you’ve made a mistake.
Finally, you have to understand the market that you’ve created. You may have a single product and you may need to start a few startups on a relatively small scale. For someone who makes $10/hour blogging a lot, it certainly is not where they start at their current company. The market for an enterprise software player could have something like a billion users, but the question is, how many startups can you create on that scale? And do you want to be part of that billion user base when you should be supporting an existing company — the real job of an enterprise software giant?
In the next few years, the next billion users are likely to create a billion startups. As that happens, the only way to create the kind of money that you want is to understand how the next billion users are going to use these new kinds of powerful, distributed technologies. That’s the only way the next billion will become billion tech startups.
Editor’s update: The number of startup acquisitions that started as early as 2002 — many of them that came in as a result of the dot-com crash — remains large. Here’s looking at the numbers and how big the number has been getting. Here’s looking at the companies that are most similar to Sequoia/Sequoia as well, how large a stake that has had in a number of large deals for its portfolio companies. You can see a snapshot of the overall number, and let’s discuss some of the different strategic advantages of the Sequoias and Sequoias, the bigger firms.
(Editor’s note: The author of this article has some of the same strategic advantages from Sequoia/Sequoia.)"
"Back in 2011, Tiny Prints, a company that allows you to upload photos into the fabric of a t-shirt or other apparel without having to print that photo yourself, announced that it had successfully produced more than half a million prints in its first month. In addition, Tiny Prints also claims its products are more affordable than competing products and that it has sold products in China for a while now.

 of “the thing the consumer wants to know in advance of making that decision,” as he told TechCrunch. “If the consumer’s interested in us, we’re willing to go head-down to the store, and have a demo, and see if they’re interested in this…that’s really how we do it, but we’re also willing to do that.”
The company was founded by a team of former Facebook engineers, including Vikram Rupani (VP of marketing and business development) and Ankit Kumar (CEO and co-founder). Facebook engineering is no stranger in India so it made sense to keep the engineering team there, but a source tells us that Facebook has also been actively hiring non-engineering talent (or buying them) to bring its engineering side to New York.
As we wrote when Facebook acquired MyTango, it was a notable departure, especially since Facebook hadn’t taken any of the other platforms it had already acquired away, and is taking full ownership for what it has instead:

"The Android Beta of Google’s Chrome browser is now rolling out today, in preparation for its next big update which will bring a lot more of the Android web browser’s functionality under Google’s belt.
Along with a new toolbar button to switch between tabs, a new search bar at the top of the screen, and search results within the browser itself, Google is also releasing a bunch of new features that should help you search easier.
In order to begin, you need to be running Chrome 3.1 or higher. If you’re still on version 1.0, this should be the last time you need to upgrade. You’ll then immediately see the new search bar at the top of your screen, and with it, you can search inside files, Gmail or your calendar.
However, even with the new feature, it’s more likely that you’ll need to upgrade as the Google Play store doesn’t really get what you’re doing. We’re also not going to try to do a review of the new version yet to make some final judgment. The new search bar, and toolbar button, could work better for Android. There are probably more improvements, and the bigger feature-centric update could make it more important.
Another feature that’s worth checking is that Google doesn’t try to compete with the apps already installed on your phone. Instead, they’re focused on pushing the best Google Play apps as the biggest contenders in the space.
When you launch the software-defined Internet browser (Smoji ), it starts the downloading process as you switch back and forth between apps. This is really interesting for Google. The browser is always a bit more open to a lot of customization, especially when you want to have Google Play or Chrome installed on your phone, given that it’s an open platform that any developer can use.
While the browser has received a lot of polish since debuting back in 2011, it had always been missing a lot of features that needed in updates. The main thing was that it didn’t support things like bookmarklets or Google Search buttons. Google has added them to Chrome to match up better with the Google Search feature.
We’ve also heard about Chrome as a performance improvement and an improvement. We understand that the browser is faster on slower smartphones due to some changes. These seem like an obvious ways to justify an update. So, it’s still worth checking out.
The browser now automatically starts searching for Chrome tabs on some websites. Also, the browser’s speed has improved a lot over in the last few months as the OS has gotten more and more powerful.

We’ve also been asked an important question: Is the new Android browser better or worse?
Google says it is, but they don’t really have to explain to answer this question. There have to be more details and nuances, too, because of how Google has done it thus far.
As for the other features, the bigger and more obvious improvement that really matters is the new toolbar bar at the top of the screen: Google is not only releasing search bar, but they’re also adding search results. So now when you search somewhere you love using Google Search, but you’ve downloaded an ad banner, Search bar should appear as a bar below the results, for instance.
Google says it is taking a small percentage for the design of the browser."
"Google will add in more Facebook connections as part of its social network launching today. That’s one area where Google’s mobile operating system will help its users connect and share content as it continues to evolve to be the social network of the future. There’s

. But while that of a larger size it will focus efforts on what the best way is in the medium of content. So what does the company hope will encourage subscribers to spend more time in its app.
The idea will be to allow a range of users to pay a discounted tier for unlimited access to content from Teads.
While that’s being trialled in the U.K. the first test was in Germany, as soon as today Twitter has announced that it rolled out to Brazil and the U.K.
With a base in San Francisco the company has a team of more than a dozen in Paris, based in the CEE region. With $300 million in funding it’s looking to double its monthly revenue to $500 million by the end of 2015, the company’s goal is to develop a global business for all of its service, both video and audio.
As a point of comparison to Snapchat, where its business was funded through an early growth investment (now the company employs ‘partners’ to make money from advertising).
However it’s not like Snapchat is looking to use its new, multi-platform cash flow model to build a global user base of new users, and compete in the wider market of video.
In fact, in the U.K. it’s been trying to do just that.
It’s also building up its business in the other area – as a social discovery platform for those living and who have traveled to other parts of the world, including Africa, Southeast Asia and India. Other features it offers include photos, which are currently being served in the U.K. only.
While the U.K. is still a small market the business model seems to be paying off. For instance it found a ‘Signup’ model in India and now it runs across the rest of the country to enable users to sign up to receive an account and access to content from their friends who are ‘bigged up’ online.
There is also an app, called Teads Social, which is based in Israel and supports Android, iOS, Windows PC and iPhone, and another, a ‘Spotify for news’ called the Soundtrack App.
Teads, which is backed by Fortumo, and Beverley Capital, is actually also expanding internationally.
Speaking to us the Twitter founder explained that, as with the U.K., the team is continuing development, as people are very aware of what they want from that. “We’ve got things that we’ve learned from the countries, like when people think about social in the U.K. people think social media for them not social media for them. But when they hear about the first time they think about the future of how they like to find and make a social, connected person,” he says.
He had this to say at the same time:
On the other side of the coin I asked what this actually entails, given Twitter is so well positioned to build out the social media service. “I don’t see that as a competitor to Twitter,” he confirmed. However Teads’ witnesses told me that Twitter was “in the mood for social media” around the time of the launch.
“We can be a bit of a bit of a copycat competitor – I guess not!”
So how does the social media business model work in this area? Teads tells me it’s a freemium model. “At our core we offer an advertising option in addition to the transactional offering and we have been experimenting a lot to see how it can work,” he told me in an interview. It’s more than one customer, rather than many. “We have 40,000 accounts on our platform for advertisers and advertisers out there,” he confirms.
It also has other opportunities as the company gets a foothold and continues to grow its social media footprint and user base: “we will be looking to further integrate advertising, too. We are looking to integrate ad in the ‘Teads’ product in the coming months. We are also looking to offer other advertising and other opportunities in the U.K. and we’ll also look to leverage the platform to better grow our sales – the more ads we can deliver in the more engaging mobile app, the better services we can offer, of course we can better serve advertisers by giving marketers more money for advertising,” he says.
The U.K. is not new to Twitter; it was the first market to see the service integrate with Facebook. Today Twitter is also the home market after it launched Twitter Ads in November and is now looking to expand into digital.
Teads, which has raised $12 million to date, is

ter, it looks like there’s a few things here. As the company tells it:”
The first is that they want to provide the ability to send large files by way of the Web that a server or machine can process. As a point of comparison, the company has been growing its Web-based network. It has 2.6 million registered users in the crowd as of April, with more than 300,000 download speed across more than 50 countries.
The second part of Tivo is what a user calls “micro services,” which is a way to support new features. While there are a lot of services that do this, they work with more than 10,000 developers to support things like new platforms, new applications, new applications, new devices and more.
So, to give you an idea of the scale of the number of developers on TvoS, a developer using an app in three weeks has a good shot of becoming a major player. And this is another way to show it.
As the company has grown, you can see a number of TvoS open to developers — including those that have already launched on Google Play. The company notes that the app has also been optimized with mobile devices based on its optimizable, and developers are now offering a way for users to create a cloud storage option that can be shared between multiple apps.
With the launch of TvoS today, the company believes that there’s now some 3 billion of its users (which include 5,000 app developers and 10,000 developers) using its apps at any given time.
The company does not disclose those figures but says that the number has gone up to 8.2 million in the past month — a sign that its service has been growing.
TvoS also offers several features. For instance, it can help developers manage their app and service updates, and can integrate with third-party apps like Gmail, Dropbox, Flickr, Android, Apple Store and Box.

In terms of product roadmap to support its customers — that is one of the biggest challenges for a new company coming from a background in software with a strong focus on mobile gaming — the company is bullish. “One of the most crucial things a company is able to do is to have a roadmap,” said P. V. Balakrishnan, co-founder of TvoS, in a statement. “In the current environment, many developers don’t have a roadmap. But, as the mobile gaming market continues to grow and developers see increasing opportunities in the space, most of the same issues that exist around how to better create and maintain an app must be fixed. At this stage, we are really excited to have partners on board to help us do that.”
As for TvoS’ long-term future and a company that is moving beyond its roots as a consumer-facing service to target enterprise-style applications, there are a few examples to point to. Just last week Google’s Tectonic opened a private beta and will be taking beta testers in June."
"As Instagram continues to expand into the business of photo publishing, one more thing has been taken notice: Instagram is launching an Android app aimed at expanding the service’s functionality for desktop mobile devices. Dubbed the “Adobe Connect” SDK, the new version of the Adobe Mobile Productivity and Finance SDK now includes support for photo and video editing on a desktop PC.
The idea here, according to a company spokesperson, is to make it much easier for developers to integrate Instagram’s ecosystem into their own, desktop applications. For those consumers of Instagram photos the company does not provide a mobile photo editing option, so there are users who would probably welcome the ability.
For the past few years, the company has been releasing updates that expand the service to work on a larger amount of devices, including its own web and native mobile apps. These include the new “instant view” feature, which is how the current version of the adverb works, along with tweaks to the app including some visual changes and tweaks to the that are aimed at making it more user-friendly for mobile.
This has included a revamped profile and feed that now includes new content from your friends’ connections and better recommendations, along with the introduction of search.
The goal here is to deliver the experience of a feed, which has the ability to pull in your friends’ Instagram photos into your own feed, which will show up right when you tap on a user’s name on your desktop desktop.
In addition, the new feed will now automatically pull in your photos from Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn into the same timeline with those

 BY the launch of its new iPhone 5s and 5s Plus. But it’s also preparing to follow on in the wake of its rivals with its next product: it’s called the Apple Watch 2 and will be unveiled on January 28."
"While Apple continues iterating and improving its health-tracking HealthKit and health tracking watch on iOS, there’s another big health-tracking platform in the company’s arsenal: The health-tracking platform from HealthTap, which was founded in 2007 and has raised over $1.9 million in pre-Series A funding on its own site, HealthTap.com.
The new HealthTap Health app is being designed to help manage patients and improve the way they use health-tracking platforms. HealthTap already offered HealthTap HealthKit Health at its premium tier, but the company says HealthTap Health is the first health-tracking platform to offer more granular health-tracking.
HealthTap’s HealthTap Health app is focused on tracking and keeping in touch with users. According to HealthTap Co-Founder and CEO Pat Moberg, the health platform is meant to help connect users with “the most successful,” particularly healthcare professionals or anyone working in healthcare. HealthTap uses physicians to create profiles, which can then be used to invite others to join. HealthTap also offers a variety of wellness and wellness plans tailored according to a physician’s career. Moberg says HealthTap hopes its HealthKit HealthTap Health app (and HealthTap Health) HealthTap Health app will one day become “The Career Health Database.”

While HealthTap’s Health app allows you to keep tabs on medical providers, it’s the HealthTap Health Health app that’s going deeper and allows doctors to create profiles, share information to their resume, and better understand their career, with a more focused on careers and career analytics.
HealthTap, founded initially in 2007, offers health-tracking tools that include: Ether, CMS, HealthKit, HealthMate, and HealthMate Connect, for example, plus HealthMate Sync and HealthMate Cloud. HealthTap’s HealthMate app provides access to “a number of fitness and nutritional data points and track health through a variety of simple tools,” and HealthMate’s HealthMate sync offers access to some 5,000 health-monitoring apps. HealthMate’s HealthIQ is designed to be used for health and fitness to measure things like how much time people are awake at night, how much water they have, how much exercise they’re doing, etc. HealthMate HealthMate HealthIQ HealthMate HealthIQ HealthIQ HealthQ is a calorie tracking app for tracking weight gain, workouts, sleep, exercise sessions, sleep quality, etc. HealthIQ HealthIQ HealthIQ HealthMate HealthIQ HealthIQ HealthMate HealthIQ has a free HealthMate Health app, but its HealthIQ app is more focused on fitness, while HealthIQ HealthMate Health doesn’t pay for luxury features.
The new Health app includes some new features. For example, today, the Health app includes a set of activity and fitness tracking. The Health app will also include new features and data. This means it’s not just being made for doctors, but can be used by anyone in Moberg’s words.
There are still five major hurdles to the Health app HealthMate Health app, however, according to Moberg: They include getting the physicians on board on board with HealthTap, which HealthMate Health currently does, along with getting healthcare professionals to sign up for HealthMate’s Health Dashboards where they can see their own health status, as well as health-tracking data shared by others (HealthMate’s founders tell us it’s reaching 40,000 unique users per day). Healthchat, meanwhile, will need to grow its user base and then build out its platform for connecting third party apps on the Health app itself.
Health is a healthy market – it has a robust, online community that includes both the HealthMate Health app (and a healthy overlap of other health tracking apps) and HealthTap’s Health app. The Health app is the leading health-tracking app among adults and health professionals, says Moberg.
HealthMate’s app is currently the top health app in the Apple App Store (in the list of the top 25 free apps in the Health section of the App Store).
HealthMate’s Health app is a free download on the iTunes App Store
In its HealthMate Health app, users will be able to track their weight gain, weight loss, run distance and exercise, health indicators, fitness goal settings, sleep quality and more. HealthMate Health will also allow users to

 it, it wouldn’t be crazy to see these apps become a more important part of the Android experience.
In his piece, Zadich says that people who spend too much time on their phones and get bogged down in multiple screens can have a real problem where “a large amount of time is taken to un-calm them and get them back to focusing on something else.”
By reducing the need to keep constantly looking at their phones and taking notes (so that they don’t miss meetings, their family, etc), Zobrist says the company wants to create “a social environment where people can express themselves in a more natural and less fragmented way.” This could help them better work, not just at reducing stress, but also potentially help them better understand their own selves, too.
For example, it may help that Google’s app offers private messaging, and also it’s a lot of fun to talk to the Android Wear watch with the watch’s ear cups turned on, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t something to be said for Google’s approach to its Android Wear platform for the general mobile watch community.
Zobrist believes that Google Go will be something people can wear their time on their wrists for the rest of their life, but even after a few years, users won’t care if they take a watch or a watch. They want to use the device right, but they don’t want to use it all the time, and maybe, even eventually, Google Glass become a more popular choice as a wearable. Then again, Google has hinted at an Android smartwatch, and there’s also the possibility that we might see all the company can do with it in terms of Google Home and all the other pieces.
To be clear, Zobrist is right that Google is focused on bringing Glass to as many of its product owners as it can, and that it will look to partner with companies that also offer smartwatches from some of its biggest players. But Google’s approach to wearables, as they see it, is all about giving us a peek into their own future, seeing Google Glass become a more pervasive part of every consumer electronics experience.
(Disclosure: Zobrist’s current employer is AOL, and Zobrist does indeed own an Android smartwatch.)"
"HTC, it may have to give it up that it is the company that brought the first-generation HTC One to market in November with a $199 price tag and an extremely aggressive pre-order campaign, which saw the company go up to $499 in just three days or so. And yet, there was something else that the company did not offer up, which could be described as a “surprise.”
Instead, the company announced that it’s releasing the One 2 in the “limited quantities” today.
What those quantities are will depend, of course, on the company’s need for the phone.
When we first reviewed the device last Tuesday, the 2 was set to be available from a number of partners in the U.S., including Motorola, Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless. This includes the pre-order phone, the device itself, and a new “micro SIM” phone (which can also be used to take advantage of the phone’s features, like calling with a non-cellular data plan.)
For the new “micro SIM” feature phone, however, the price points are not for the lowest of them all.
It’s at $199, for a phone that has the best specifications in the affordable phone category, with a 4G LTE LTE device as well as the new micro SIM device.
But the phone is really all about the camera, with a 5.7-inch IPS camera, a 13 megapixel camera with a dual LED flash (which flashes both white and blue), and a dual-core 1GHz Cortex-C9 processor that should help it handle the heavy lifting at a higher resolution level than ever before, with that same resolution that the best smartphone cameras could achieve thanks to the best lenses and optics.
It also features a new, improved rear-facing camera for better still photography and low light photography, as well as a new dual-tone camera with a new design and more colors, as well as new features with the rear camera, including the ability to double as a flash, for more lighting. And in addition, the phone’s 3-megapixel front-facing camera has a lot to show, with the same results from its previous incarnation as well as more.
At $249 for the first few and $299 when they go down for “limited quantities”.
The 3-inch HTC One tablet is a pretty solid, no doubt, but it doesn’t have

 to what a number of other companies did prior to the deal:
“A major international investor and strategic partner in online education, the new Fund has built up its initial investment in a couple of key ways,” said Jeff Hatala, a partner at Reed Inc. in a statement. “It has a strategic position: it helps connect the education sector globally, and its early capital will provide us with the capital and resources to grow across this country.”
Funding a small start in the eLearning space isn’t exactly rocket science, and the addition of three new, first-time investors is exactly what they should be excited for.
The firm has already raised a total of $2 million since December 2010 in outside venture funding since it was set up as a seed back in 2008.
While Reed Inc.’s strategy is based around its initial investments in both existing education players as well as new ones, it has been largely focused on more recent companies. Its first eLearning partner was a company called NextLevel, and it’s investing in one of its most recent investments as it prepares to expand those to new verticals. This follows Reed’s seed fund in 2009, when it invested in an online video sharing site called Livefyre.com and a similar video platform called Klear.tv.
Reed Inc. said it will be participating in all of Seedcamp, the first of what will hopefully be many more Seedfunds and subsequent accelerators, by investing in both the companies that are funded by the program, and looking at investments in the firms that are in development."
"Fotolia, the Israeli social network based on video sharing and discovery, is the latest big player in the U.K. to launch with a focus on mobile. Today Fotolia is announcing a £100 million ($146m) “super aggressive” Series B round for the company, led by Index Ventures and Tami Rothery, partner with U.K. startup Tami Rothery, co-founder of social media marketing agency RMA, the founder of the tech incubator which created Fotolia.
To-date, more than 50 million users have been uploaded to Fotolia, and 300 million videos have been viewed. As well as the usual social networking features, which include commenting and liking videos, users can also like or comment on new videos via mobile.
As well as the usual social sharing channels mentioned above, Fotolia is also announcing a ‘Discover New’ section aimed at the content-creating space. This pulls in content from the web. The site will be open to other content creators who want to get involved in the creation of content such as music, fashion, beauty and fashion bloggers with an app. This is similar in concept to some sites such as VOTL and Soundcloud.
“We’re very excited about having the potential of this new audience which we’re seeing increase everyday,” says CEO Olli Pekka Janma. “It’s very fragmented the world across social networks and mobile platforms.”
Fotolia has a history as a social network for social networking. Janma left the company he co-founded in 2006 when it became popular in Europe, to do a PhD in advertising at University of Wisconsin at Madison.
The social networking space offers a place for Fotolia to enter new markets, and perhaps, it’s time for Europe to get in to take that lead.
“One thing about the platform… is that it’s not in the U.S., but that’s why we were attracted by the opportunity to go into Europe and take advantage of that,” says Janma.
“Europe, at least for now, has no choice but to go into Europe,” says Janma, noting that there’s a dearth of content creation on iOS, Android and other platforms for Fotolia to compete with. “It’s time to capitalize on that opportunity and make sure that in Europe, we’re at the centre of the value chain,” he adds.
However, he says it’s too early in the product development process to pin down what exactly is likely to be launched in Europe. Right now, in fact, there’s no hard-hitting decision to be made with this company, but the company will definitely look closely at emerging markets and Southeast Asia.
Pekka — who, along with co-founder Rothery, was responsible for the design and development of Facebook’s native mobile app — says Fotolia will be looking at how it can improve both the performance of its apps and how it makes money. They are already very bullish on mobile: they will be a $5 billion mobile ad unit by 2017, according to Janma, and their revenue is expected to

based its acquisition of San Francisco-based Huddle, to develop a better mobile presence.
Huddle was previously known as Classtag (though recently the startup has had to pivot from Clast, its former self-branded, self-service site for the search keyword space, to Classtag) and had raised $2 million from KPCP Ventures, First Round Capital, First Round, and others.
The company doesn’t make money off of in-app purchases, though it has experimented with in-app purchases in the past — it’s tried in the past with the hope of driving more in-app purchases, and this was the same focus on mobile this time around.
Classtag CEO Ryan Holmes says the company expects to earn revenue out of the upcoming acquisition. He did however admit that Huddle was “much weaker” than Classtag — the former had raised $21.6 million in venture funding, while the latter had raised $2 million. So, much more modestly, Classtag raised $1,900,000 in a Series A-1 round back in August 2012. So, in short, the $1.6 million the company raised back in 2012 was actually less than what Huddle is planning to pay."
"A new digital tool from Adobe Digital Index launched today provides users with personalized insights on social media mentions by companies like Facebook, Twitter, Google, LinkedIn, Google+ and other popular services. It’s a pivot from its Digital Index Business product, which launched as part of Adobe’s Spring 2012 acquisition of Digital Index.
The move was first reported by Computerworld, although there was no confirmation of the acquisition or announcement, only that the product had been acquired. That led some to speculate it was a case of Google paying Adobe for digital use of their shared content, although that also remains to be seen.
A company announcement from Digital Index notes, “Social marketing is going to become a much more important piece of marketing, especially for SMBs.” It also notes, “When you connect digital and social media campaigns, you often have to think of them as one big deal. And there is an enormous amount of diversity in the services out there — indeed, there are other services that can be used to reach customers, but none that provide this level of depth and breadth of tools.”
When you get to the specific service Digital Index lists, it’s the ability to drill down into a particular piece of content. “The ability is to connect different pieces of content with specific profiles and with specific audiences,” reads the message on the website. It also lists the service’s email admins and clients, describing what it calls Social Media Analytics as the first, albeit critical, tool customers will use.
According to Digital Index, Social Media Analytics includes:
The other big news is something it says it has been working on since 2009. “Social media isn’t just about reaching audience, it is about engagement, engagement analytics.” It says it will now be using its “new social discovery engine” to automatically surface content based on the social media accounts, and what kinds of campaigns they run.
The company has been running a pilot trial of Social Marketing Analytics last month, and in its announcement, it notes, “The Social Media Analytics product will help brands optimize and create their brand social accounts, track how engaged and ROI they have with their campaigns and social media activities.”
The social marketing space has been getting a fair bit of attention in the years since it went public, with companies like SocialBakers or AdRoll running extensive marketing campaigns and social media analytics on behalf of Twitter, Google and others. And in April, the SocialBakers of the world acquired social content advertising platform Brandery.
In terms of what Social Media Analytics will provide, Digital Index says it uses “data analytics, data reporting, customer and product intelligence at a huge scale.”
The data that it stores on Social Media Analytics is based on data stored in its customer accounts, the marketing campaigns, its customer relationships, and data that it pulls from LinkedIn, Google AdWords, Gmail, and Twitter. “Customers use our service to track, analyze, and track actions with their campaigns and in-source activities,” says Digital Index, and it adds, “Social media is an ever-growing market that has been largely overlooked while advertising has been increasingly targeted.”
In addition to offering to personalize your ad campaigns, Social Media Analytics provides data analytics to the customer base, allowing it to track and detect “where campaign effectiveness is improving,” then analyze these campaigns to see how those “pitch to the consumer” campaigns are performing and on what kind of

 indicating. You might have a pretty powerful tool for salespeople at the start, but as you’re building up your own team, you’re getting better and better at taking the lead on new leads."
"Apple doesn’t always do the right thing, but it’s time to put into the same company and make the same decisions. For many consumers, and for Apple.io itself, it’s the same choice.
Apple’s own decisions lead it into the situation — for a good or bad. And it’s all because the end user’s mind feels attached to the decision.
When you’re building a device like this, though, it’s quite different. And that’s very Appleian. The end user is an iPhone owner and an iPhone developer.
That makes it tricky for people to change. Sometimes, the right course of action is just that: a good decision.
The thing about Apple’s choices, though, is that they’re often more reflective of the company’s priorities. And that’s not necessarily good for the user. Or, like many decisions made in tech, the outcome is sometimes a reflection of the company’s bigger thinking. (Which has led fans of companies to bash Apple on Twitter.)
To some extent, Apple should have to adjust for this situation. You should think for a moment about how this might affect your experience for the other people using Apple devices. Maybe you need a case or a keyboard with a new iPad in your computer case that you can drop in case design isn’t always a priority.
If you go into a meeting and there’s a discussion about Apple’s Apple decision, think of what the implications for your users will be."
"For almost everyone, life would be a better place if there wasn’t a massive disconnect between their parents and their own. There are plenty of startups promising a smarter and more active parent, but most simply duplicate a task that was previously handled by one of the smartest people in the whole world — the rest are either focused on the data-visualization side or the communication side.
One of the most notable recent efforts is Lift, an in-game chat app that lets you chat about your day life and other things (like your height on a map). It’s just released version 2.5.0 and is available for iPad, iPhone, and Android devices. But Lift doesn’t aim to solve the problem of connecting users to be online and communicate through mobile channels.
That was Lift’s original goal, but it was really about simplifying the process when you wanted to keep in touch with your parents via video messaging. When Lift came along, it wanted to make it more interactive and connected to the outside world, not just with video messaging but also voice calls. That’s why Lift launched a beta version of Lift that allowed only three-to-six-year-old children to join.
In Lift’s updated version 2.5, the app is significantly more engaging, as there are now three-to-six-year-olds or preschoolers in your Lift chat about your day. While parents can call a Lift chat from their Apple Watch or smartphone, this option has since been abandoned.

Lift’s update is a welcome move in terms of general user experience, but it’s definitely not a great product for a group of children who are just starting out — the majority of whom probably have no parents to speak to. Now that it allows for extended participation, Lift could be used by parents with young children to help them get around their parents faster. (Or maybe it could be used as an outlet for younger teenagers.)
When Lift launched, it was designed to give users a channel to interact with their grandparents. That eventually opened up Lift to parents with the ability to chat, but it did nix the ability to speak. Now, it’s just a chat feature that parents can use instead of voice call. This gives people a reason to use Lift, a better version of what’s not available on other platforms yet.
Lift will be available both in the App Store for free, as well as Google Play. Both Google Play and the Kindle store are starting to offer Lift this week, and they’ll offer a free trial if your child joins for the first six weeks. If that’s too much of a hassle (and it is), another option is $15/month (an early discount if they use Lift three times a year), or $99/month (an early discount if they take it three times a year) or $199/year (an early discount if they stay for over 12 months)."

 it as a standalone company.
“The big idea is to build a service-to-service business, which will enable us to have multiple companies working on our platform and to scale up really quickly,” he tells TechCrunch. “We will keep an open platform for all the various vendors that will have strong relationships with other companies working on their platforms. They will be able to take advantage of our APIs, and be able to integrate our software with their platforms.”
The idea, of course, is that there will be different providers operating on the platforms. In the case of a “large company”, such as an oil company, it will be the first to “sell this on multiple platforms”, writes the company in the letter with a “high degree of confidence” that no one else is going to want to use that “product,” thus creating more friction to sell it. (The letter is signed by Nikhil Bhargava, the founder of Viber.) “As a reminder, Viber provides a platform for connecting with Viber users who is one can integrate with your own. As a software-as-a-service company, we will be able to provide companies with a more flexible service plan than the traditional one. And one that is sure to meet any kind of needs that people have. This makes Viber a flexible service that any user can use,” adds Cedull. 
Another interesting aspect of Viber’s services roadmap is that it will be taking a lead in building apps to develop, and to continue to build and improve the user experience for developers to use. “In the future, Viber could have some interesting apps in my mind and I could see it to integrate it and be one of the big platform makers in this space in the future,” says Dhaliakrishnan. “I imagine that in four to six months, the company will have some interesting applications that are coming and that we will be able to integrate in that possibility.”
So this is another step as Viber continues to build on top of its platform and get more developers building for it. While the focus is still clearly on growth and developing apps for Viber to use, it looks like Viber is taking a lead in pushing the platform forward.
“We expect that Viber will be one of the top platforms to see improvements,” writes Cedull. “Some of these apps will also be built to serve as a gateway for developers who are currently using Viber, but want to switch to a different platform that Viber supports.”
It seems likely that Viber may have some traction among young people — perhaps more so than the rest of the world — as it has a higher proportion of U.S. users who have not yet bought a virtual phone. And it’s a smart move that’s likely to appeal to them as a future product direction for the mobile market. “Viber has already proven success among very young and affluent people as a messaging app aimed at younger customers,” Gaurav says from the letter.
“We’re proud that in our long history, Viber has made the largest market share of mobile users in the U.S. with 2 million users, a far larger than that of other platforms. We are here and I am here but today and I have no money at all,” he adds. The company is clearly hoping more users will come from Asia over the next few years to use its apps, as they have done, and then Viber will be able to make money.
The full letter from Vij in full below:"
"A former Googler who was working on the Hangouts app for Google now says that he’d like to see what Twitter had in mind when it started building its new Chat feature. Apparently Twitter didn’t just see the chat feature being built, but also wanted developers to think about it too and respond quickly in chat threads to requests. A Twitter spokesman has confirmed with a statement with me that it has taken note of the Chat thread, and says that there will be a new announcement on his site soon.
Googler’s tweet seems particularly ironic given that it’s a comment-only feature. According to his statement, an engineer working on the Chat thread “made this comment in an almost inimitable way. He was clearly very happy that it had taken off so quickly, and so quickly in terms of volume. So he added “this is pretty smart as a way to encourage more developers and consumers

 like, but not necessarily, much fun things to do with, is the concept of putting the money down and saying “I’d love to have a hit album,” or the idea of an album that is less about me and more about making this album and more about me and I mean it, a lot of people.”
That’s right, the company is developing an album that it plans to get out of their friends and family, and a bit less on their own. It’s going to be called Anki and it’s still going to be very much a work in progress. 
But hey, look how much fun it is to use the Internet as a marketing channel. Aka a product.
Oh, and Anki has been a bit of a mess for a little while now, so I’ll be watching what they do in a while."
"It looks like Apple might be considering acquiring iMessage. Last year, when the company’s iMessage App Store launched with a little encouragement from some major competitors, it was mostly an iPhone-specific product. Today, Apple has announced that the iMessage App Store no longer works for iPhone users, and its future for iPhone apps seems to be looking less like an iPhone and more like an iMessage product.
Today, the iMessage App Store was updated with the addition of an iPhone 5 support, which means that a lot of users who have previously used it for messages for the iPhone will no longer be able to send text, photos or notes to iMessage’s users.
You can see an error message that shows iMessage is no longer available for iPhone users, as I spotted from a screenshot above.
It’s unclear what kind of functionality the Apple App Store is going to offer those who have purchased a phone, or whether Apple will eventually allow people to purchase the apps that the iPhone supports.
Here’s the text of the message:

The error message for iPhone users that have already sent a message to iMessage’s users might be saying that the phone is broken, which has not been true of the iMessage app since its debut more than a year ago. But the new update to the new and more popular iPhone application on iOS (just updated) says that it will soon be available to all the companies in the “iMessage Mobile” ecosystem.
Apple first introduced an iMessage feature back at WWDC 2012, with an iPhone app that allowed users to send short-range messages for quick notifications. Then, the company introduced an iMessage app called iMessage Mobile, which allowed users to buy emoji (in a few months, there will be also an Apple iPhone app for emoji), as well as the iMessage desktop mobile application.
After buying and using iMessage, its mobile application didn’t really have any special utility, and that’s all because of the problem it solved.
Now, even though Apple wants to continue to support these iPhone applications, making sure iPhone users have an easy way to quickly send text, videos, and notes to each other, it might eventually move away from selling itself the “new kid” in the smartphone ecosystem (Apple’s own attempt at building out the iMessage ecosystem also has been limited to iPad support, but today’s update could be the beginning of a new wave for better support of those that are already here).
We’re not actually being told when the new iMessage mobile application is supposed to arrive today. So far, the iMessage App Store still shows up in the iTunes App Store. And while we can’t comment on an App Store review for iMessage (Apple has yet to confirm that it’s coming to iOS), we can tell you that in the update above, Apple explains that it will allow users to send text and photos (even the small, animated GIFs Apple added and the jpg, pk and gifs and animated GIFs to create the gifs in the app), but the messages are still synced back up to their iMessage apps at iCloud.com, the company notes.
The new update to the iMessage mobile app could change the game in the industry a bit after Apple, with the iMessage App Store becoming a bigger place for developers to sell to pay for the apps to build their products and products out on the iMessage service. Now that they can make more in one place to sell than before, and with a lower price, Apple’s iTunes App Store will become more active with Apple-made apps that customers find there, which could also mean that users will spend more.
It’s unclear at this stage when the iMessage App Store will see big numbers, or how aggressive Apple will be making its presence on the app store this year. But if Apple truly takes its product from just some of those third-party developers, to selling the

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 the company offers a few free tiers, with options that go up to a $99/month pricing plan to cover 80% of the price of a two-year agreement.
Another free option on this page is the Tivo Phone, a dual-core smartphone and smartphone accessory that was part of the recent batch of Amazon Echo devices.
The free options that the company offers are pretty basic, for example, when it comes to the free Google Now on Tap, there’s no navigation, notifications, home screen, or even any integration of Google Now’s voice assistant. You have to use the app on the free tier to use it.
But while these offerings are basic, they’re something that could appeal to some of Android power users. And when Amazon is making these things available on Android phones, its phone — and other smartphones — can really shine.
Amazon has previously offered some great deals on a variety of its phone, including a basic $99 per year option that allows users to get their phones for free. The Amazon Plus phone is an added value to the Amazon Plus phone, too, offering the same basic service, and you’re likely going to get some features that come with it.
Amazon is trying to sell the phone without needing a $150 or $200 price cut, but offering the free tiers might just get even more users excited."
"Gesture gestures have long been the go-to way to control a touchscreen, with Apple and Windows phones the most popular models. But gestures don’t work over Android or any kind of OS screen, so the company is going with its core strength — traditional touch input, not much different from the gesture itself. It’s possible that it will offer some kind of SDK support in the future to more easily build support for its own platform.
We have an update on the timing of this SOLO gesture support announcement, but it’s an interesting development nonetheless. For instance, the gesture can be used to touch on your Android phone. So while Google has made several gestures that let you do things like touch the camera, touch on the phone, or simply swipe gestures in Gmail, the Amazon app for Android on the screen supports much more so, just in a touch with simple taps. So it will be interesting to see how this works on Kindle, and on other platforms.
As it is a gesture, and the hardware is not quite there yet, the functionality doesn’t involve a UI change, but it works in principle. In that respect, its more like taking Google Now’s Home screen, including the various contextual gestures.
The whole gesture gesture can also be used to control the screen. If you use a gesture sensor on your smartphone, for instance, by swiping gestures, you can tap on the side of the screen or on an app icon to access other information on your phone. In that sense, it is a far more direct analogue to Google Now, which Google has developed in software such as Assistant and Assistant SDK (and others in that area) as a result of it testing gesture support.
This is the next big gesture-based mobile platform from Amazon, with voice assistant capabilities and a number of interesting touch-based features. But it was done without offering a user an SDK so it could be adapted to Android and iOS, so this release won’t have the benefits of gesture support. At this point, it has a Siri-like feel and feel.
It’s worth noting that the Amazon Fotango SDK isn’t currently available when it comes to Android, but Google has announced support for a voice search API that could make gesture support even more valuable, if it can get a head of a market that already has Amazon in the ring.
We’re probably not going to see Amazon’s next platform, even as an API, but it has always been developing its own platform to power gesture gesture technology. It’s interesting to see how this will play out, and I’m curious to see how it will develop. This is Amazon’s new toy, and not yet ready to ship so don’t expect it to go any further."
"We’re now a week into 2017 and with some new numbers available today from a few of the biggest names in education — including Pearson, Apple, Pearson, and many others — we’ve seen a few interesting developments and perhaps a number of familiar faces in terms of how educational content are consumed. Some of the biggest names in education are starting to make announcements on what’s next (or at least preparing to make changes), some of the most prolific companies are starting to find creative ways to reach, learn from and access data from their platforms directly, some of them may even find acquisitions, and some of Silicon Valley’s most valuable education players have begun to follow suit.

 technology, but at the same time we were always thinking about how to build technology that allows people to work in markets that aren’t exactly in your jurisdiction.”
In addition, Tout was intended to be able to serve as a “universal” communications platform, which offers both global connectivity, as well as a secure channel that links both private and public cloud services together in a single place. It was designed with the end goal of being able to use different forms of encryption. “We could encrypt your email in a way that you could do in Gmail, but it wouldn’t be a privacy violation to the user,” he explains.
Tout also has its own data centers in Santa Clara, California. And this is not just for Tout’s own servers. Its hardware is also fully compliant with the SecureSEMP protocol, which should be more secure than its software.
With these elements in place, Tout, which is now a team of 10, has set its sights on raising $150 million and plans to open its API in a couple of weeks, but with that a bit of an open question. At the very least, it might want to consider the possibility of using the funding to get itself to a place where an enterprise level design, like the Tout-to-S, is expected to ship by the end of next year.
It would take Tout a little longer to build the app itself, but it’s definitely getting closer to some sort of launch. The plan is to try to get the Android version finished as soon as possible, and to get Tout to as close as possible to its target market markets as it can. But that’s more about the Android platform than about Tout itself.
Tout is a very serious product company. The company’s CEO, Kevin Wall, has been described as a “principled technologist” and has built two companies, with one focused on hardware and the other on mobile communications, as the CMO is now.
The team recently hired a new Chief Scientist in the same department who’s known to be an expert in cloud services and security, and he also heads the Global Research Initiative.
What’s more, it’s in the world of consumer-facing hardware that Tout is most analogous to a company like AirPlay, which was built to help music-on-demand services work, and which had raised the most to date. But Tout is also a company with a big goal: to go beyond the “consumerization of enterprise” and do things that seem impossible for smaller companies to do, like AirPlay.
For Wall sake, Tout seems a little unlikely to me for this reason, based on the assumptions that everything will be digitized in the near future and that only a small portion of today’s world will have the internet. But, in a world where people need to communicate and learn, Tout may be a chance to go further. And, in a world where the internet has the potential to be more than just a broadcast channel for the information you need, there’s an opportunity here to think about how this can not only connect people to the things that matter, but about more.
“It’s very hard to talk about enterprise and enterprise and enterprise and enterprise and enterprise. And I think that’s probably part of the reason it’s easy for everyone to point at us and say it’s just a messaging app. It’s a consumer product. So easy to point at us to say that but we have a different architecture and we have a different team that comes in,”  Wall told me on a call with me.

While Tout has been largely funded by private investors, Wall admits that the funding has attracted some attention from other VCs. “They were very interested. I think we had a better product,” he said. “But I do need to build this to survive the world, and I think it can survive for a while. So here’s the thing.”
Tout is for business people. It’s not for consumers. It’s for businesses. It’s for the people who have a good deal of power when they use the internet for communication. Wall believes that many people won’t be using the internet for commerce purposes. “I think that there’s a bunch of things that we’ve been thinking about and working on and working on, but we haven’t had the funding to focus on any specific use case for that purpose,” he says.
But that is not stopping him from talking about his vision for Tout as this kind of company.
Tout was founded back in 2007. It raised $14 million in a $10 million Series A round led by Andre

. He says the team has been using a mix of existing open network and custom solutions to build a distributed network of nodes and hubs for the network (it’s more like a mesh of nodes and hubs) and he wants to make sure that each node has its own unique interface.
One of the big challenges in the open source space is latency and congestion. And I think it’s pretty important to keep to the original vision. The problem they’re solving right now is that the internet is not at parity with local infrastructure. But there is a sense of community and the ability to build apps outside of your typical tech ecosystem. They’ve created a tool to help those of us who want to build apps outside of a particular area.
They also have a way of building these apps using their own code. This is an interesting tool for any developer who wants to work with the existing code base. They are a bit more stable and you can get better performance while you are also not trying to build a global tool like some other commercial solutions, as many of the existing solutions are. They also have a way of understanding what it’s for a typical application, where it would be at a big opportunity as well when it comes to mobile apps. (Their approach is also more secure and it includes the mobile device management service.)
There are companies like Apple and a new one coming from Finland, Estonia, Spain and Spain working on their own open network. The company has a good track record."
"With the growth of digital media over the past five years, mobile advertising and app marketing is exploding, yet there are still plenty of opportunities. There’s the obvious ones, like YouTube, YouTube Kids, and ad-tech services. But there are also countless companies building tools that let you get insights inside the big brands themselves. New York City- and New York-area startup Adlans.com, which recently raised $6.7 million in Series A financing, is looking to take advantage of this opportunity.
Today, Adlans.com is launching an integrated marketing platform that enables brands to access realtime data from their top audiences (i.e., mobile). With up to 60 brands, Adlans.com has raised a total of $12.5 million across six rounds of financing. This includes a $3.2 million round from The New York Times, Madison Avenue Capital and Metamorphic Ventures. The $10 million came in a round closed in early last year and included participation from Jeff Weiner and Joe Lonsdale.
While this may be an increasingly complicated, big-time proposition — especially when they’re focused on large-scale marketing — Adlans.com’s business model is a compelling one. When one of Adlans.com’s co-founders Michael Katz explained that ad-tech is really going after the “right” big consumer groups, brands may want to know what they want. In other words, as Adlans.com becomes a more complete marketing solution, it also becomes a more comprehensive tool for brands.
To help them gain a better understanding of their core audience (and optimize their ad campaigns), Adlans.com’s platform pulls in an online audience and uses it, in turn, alongside analytics to generate insights into their target audiences and their purchasing behavior. In other words, Adlans.com pulls in data, then applies your own custom machine-learning algorithms and algorithms to your users, with Adlans.com’s support of data-driven campaigns.
The company is also working on an expanded data-focused campaign platform, targeting, and optimizing campaigns based on contextual data — not all of which are yet available. The company will roll out the technology in the first half of 2014.

However, one thing that Adlans.com is doing that will not be shared is marketing automation (to keep the privacy and security details to a minimum). That’s why the company is moving away from the traditional user-based view of Adlans.com, and instead, Katz told me, is “one part ad-based, one part predictive.”
While there have been a number of new platforms for brands, their most recent exits to marketing-driven startups like AdPics, Ivy Media Group and the Adable Media, have not been good. The Adnans’ approach is similar, to a degree. It aims to take some of the power of machine learning and algorithms out of brand branding and marketing, and give it back to business. For that reason, the Adlans co-founders have a history of having ex-ad-tech backgrounds, from Google, Yahoo and Facebook who have done their own extensive marketing work. Katz says that he began his career in ad-tech after his first investment in 2010, when he was a senior vice president of revenue, to

 of the U.S.; Google is not revealing any additional information at this time. In the company’s most recent earnings report (also published October 2012) for Q3 2012, revenues were down, but overall revenues were up over 60% compared to $166.4 billion; compared to $168.1 billion in the previous quarter, which was its biggest annual improvement since 2012:
The problem for Google is that a big chunk of its business is in mobile advertising — the revenue from that market is down to $44 billion, compared to $70 billion last year. That’s not to say that Google is not working on other applications, and it is in the process of acquiring mobile ad startup AndroidInsight in order to continue building that mobile business.
But Google did not provide specific details on its monetization efforts in the country in which it plans to expand beyond mobile; a search term that Google uses to better search in those markets in particular.
Google is also not breaking out its performance in certain countries or regions in its earnings reports and, as of this report (published November 2012), the company has not provided a number here either. Google says that it grew its mobile ad revenues in the following year over the previous year. It also says that mobile ad growth is up 60% over last year:
However, in the U.S., the company’s mobile ad growth has not been going so well that Google is trying to close a deal in the country or even enter it. According to the Wall Street Journal (December 2012):
Despite those metrics, Google has continued to keep growing its mobile ad business, which are both growing at a healthy clip, and it does plan to do so at the end of this month (Google’s earnings report for the second quarter of last year).
It’s a tricky problem as the industry is still in its infancy and, to get Google’s attention, it is having to figure out how to best get mobile app ad revenue to actually grow in a market when growth in mobile is really slowing. Apple is working on similar initiatives, too: its own Apple Media program is in piloting Apple TV and its beta as a way to further help push out app downloads and ultimately money for the App Store.
Google is obviously spending large amounts of time and effort to improve its mobile ad efforts, which have grown steadily at an annual average of $16 billion.
With the acquisition, Google will be able to expand into more areas of business. According to the WSJ, Google expects to add a number of services to its mobile ad inventory including mobile content, gaming and social. “Some of these may also be sold through our mobile websites, along with other paid apps running its mobile ad targeting and tracking capabilities,” the report says.
The service is the last remaining piece for Google, but that’s also a good sign that it’s working on mobile.
The company has made two acquisitions in the past year: Admob for $50 million, and Google Ventures to invest in video ad company PlayCast; and AdMob, which was spun out of eMarketer research."
"Last week, social news app Flipboard took a big hit after getting banned from the App Store for not allowing people to subscribe in Flipboard’s feed or take advantage of its “best feed” features. Yesterday, Flipboard co-founder and CEO Mike McCue tweeted the above warning from the App Store team.
“Flipboard is in the process of getting into #BestFeed,” McCue announced, “But don’t expect to see more.” It sounds like they are working on it.
Flipboard got into trouble yesterday after the App Store did not allow it to show you the “best” or “best” feed after the app update. But hey, you win some and we are more than a little angry. After the app update, the “last” “featured feed” feature appears.
This is a pretty significant development for the company over the past two weeks. A week ago, Flipboard got locked out of the App Store and had to scramble to find a way to deliver the “following” or “following” options on the “most visited feed” or the “latest trending topics” feed. Now, thanks to the App Store, they are getting to show what was trending in your feed in a way that isn’t just the top “news” and “social media” headlines of the day.
Flipboard’s update has helped it earn some new “best feeds” rankings in the U.S., the company’s new ranking app, Flipboard, released the app on today. The new version of Flipboard, the app has been downloaded more

 been previously confirmed.
In a joint statement, CEO Stephen Elop, CEO Braden Kilian and COO Scott Durchslag said the funding round brings the total raised by the business to $11 million. The three-month-old business has already brought in around $1 million in annual recurring revenue, and the company said it will take the total funding to $20 million.
That’s a massive amount of funding for an upstart. We’re still waiting for the press release announcing the whole round, but the amount is a huge victory for the company, given its unique, new-found business model – a $9 per month subscription model for “cute” products launched after Elop was hired in August by the former COO and COO, and launching only in Q1 2014.
There were about 40 companies on the TechCrunch stage today, some of which were announced at Disrupt NY, including Crowdtilt (a crowdfunded photo project), Punch (a platform for developers to build apps called Punchbowl that lets players fight the odds with their own Punch Punching skills) and Y Combinator-backed Lit Labs (an autopilot software platform).
Elop, also the CEO of Slack, spoke passionately about his company’s future with a brief statement. He explained to us that, since there are a number of people in his company who have been with the company since its founding days, “We’re moving in a direction that makes it easier than ever to create beautiful and simple apps with a user’s data, to connect and interact with more people than ever before – even for the first time.”
The company also emphasized its plans to be the largest independent video platform after it announced a $2.3 million seed round late last year. When there was a similar story about how Skype was acquiring fellow video-sharing app Viber, it was suggested that Facebook should acquire Viber too. It’s just one of the many others that have looked to social video to monetize their own products.
There were also a number of tech-heavy speakers today like Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg from the company’s acquisition WhatsApp. (You can see a few of those up top in the video — there’s the Facebook look and feel at the top, and some of the animated looks at the bottom.)
And we’ll also have some great company announcements. There are a number of companies around the same size as Facebook, including Twitter (though of course it’s not quite clear how Facebook is a company at the moment because it’s not really that big of a business now, though it was a major one last month anyway — and that’s how Mark Zuckerberg sold Facebook to Apple.)
There are a lot of larger startups this year, with some larger exits like Amazon’s Amazon Echo this summer — but there’s also a lot that remains to be made in mobile apps that would make you want to try to try to find your own apps that are getting the attention and getting funded and so forth.
There was no “mobile-first” company to introduce today so this is the consecutive fourth year that’s been the app economy. The last was Facebook in 2013. Today we’ll see the first app makers out of Europe get the benefit from the big investment.
That’s another consecutive of new startup launches that happened this year as Facebook made some more notable hires to its team. And on the topic of hiring, we don’t know what the final product looks like.
The company’s first app launched in July, and the initial version of the app hit the App Store in early August, while the initial web app was launched in early September from the same folks who worked on that Facebook app. There were some 1.5 million downloads by October. Today, “the App Store account for 2.5% of users.”
As you may have heard, Instagram’s Facebook Messenger app (as we called it) also emerched, with a different mobile-first angle. It debuted this summer.
That app, meanwhile, has seen 100 million snaps uploaded by users in the past three months of development, with some 50 million photos sent per-week.
The company’s app has also grown rapidly, with Facebook telling us that 90 million people are the largest figure among active

yers of the world."
"Last October, we heard from newY Combinator-backed HootSuite that their enterprise social video platform was launching a new Android app that could help companies manage how long of a video call they’ve got on their phones. The app allowed callers to review and share screenshots of their videos with a caller over the call.
HootSuite has built a large enterprise client suite that includes apps for sales people, marketing people, and PR persons. The company has signed up 6,000 companies to take advantage of their HootSuite software, and the startup is launching its iPhone app today.
HootSuites help companies manage the long hours of phone calls. HootSuite allows business owners to monitor the length of video calls and also monitor the performance of the app in real-time. Hootsuites don’t have a business model, they are free to use. It’s the apps and the technology that matter.
So what does HootSuite do in realtime? It enables call recording for phones — the company calls the phone and you record the call.
HootSuites are also helping companies manage how their phone bounces around all day. Hootsuites handle the phone bounce, and it helps HootSuites have a better handle on how long a call is going to take to be recorded in the app. HootSuites can manage the bounce rate between 1 to 10 minutes depending on the type of phone call and the device.
HootSuites work directly with each phone. So HootSuites can handle long calls in real-time, whereas some other companies in the space charge a toll and call center for recordings.
HootSuites can also work with each of the various messaging apps out there, including GroupMe and Messenger. Hootsuites can be used in groups of up to 24 people in all.
To make money, HootSuites sells a subscription plan with up to 10 phone calls per month on the iPhone. HootSuites will then get a 30 percent cut.
HootSuites’ iPhone app lets users share screenshots of video calls, and the company provides all of this information in real-time on screen, at the point they called the phone. On the iPhone, the app gives HootSuites a much more detailed view of their phone call than the standard HootSuite iPhone app.
For company owners, HootSuites offer a one-click install, so they can quickly get started and review their phone calls.
If you get into the business side, HootSuites can set up a company chat room with other HootSuite accounts.
For companies who get into the more expensive HootSuites offering, Hootsuites offer add-on add-ons that let customers see the live audio of their phone calls in real-time.
Now there are five HootSuites listed. You can get the iPhone app, HootSuites for iPhone, here and it will cost you $1.99 a month to use.
HootSuites on iPhone is a free download and is in the iTunes app store."
"Social photo sharing app Jumpl has closed on $3.5 million in seed funding led by Sequoia Capital in the U.S. and SV Angel. The new investment came from previous investors in the company, including SV Angel, Greylock Partners, and Index Ventures.
Jumpl raised an undisclosed amount of seed financing last year after co-founder and CTO Eoia Tzortzoff built a better photo sharing app called Jumpl in response to the explosion of selfie apps like Snapchat. The founders found a number of new, smaller photo messaging apps also competing with Snapchat, like Pic and Tickr competitor Snapchat, plus Messenger rival Snapchat plus Facebook-owned photo-sharing apps Facebook Snap and Photos. Jumpl, however, works best in a smaller group of contacts who have similar interests, and have the same access to each other’s personal accounts.
“Snapchat is a small app, and it’s really obvious how the community would benefit from a company focused specifically on communication, and who could also use Jumpl to communicate,” I’m told.
The startup has been in the process of rolling out new features and building a new iOS 7 release that allows iOS 7 beta users to send private messages each other and add friends. Jumpl is still at an internal launch, however. The aim was not to generate revenue, but instead to improve the app’s user experience. The new version now includes a “message screen” within the app, allowing users to send photos, videos, photos, stickers, stickers, and music lyrics to each other within the main screen.
Jumpl has since added the Send button and a

 blockchain-based, and in the future, the company wants to provide the same functionality on the web, or on mobile platforms, like iOS and Android — the company’s goal, in particular, is to turn traditional email and other static and static content into channels for user engagement.
The company is also announcing that it has raised a $3.2 million Series A from Deep Fork Capital (a firm with deep ties to the company’s founders), Tim Draper, and Bob Stawton, founder and owner and CEO of Tandem.
The round was led by Deep Fork Capital, with participation also from Google Ventures, SV Angel, Fred Wilson, who sold his eCommerce and digital publishing company, and David Karp, who left Google in the 2000s, as a result of eBay.
Deep Fork Capital and Google Ventures also participated in earlier stages of Palo Alto Ventures- and Google Ventures-backed projects.
“We’re investing in an important vertical, data-driven advertising, and we think that with time, technology and people with different backgrounds, we can achieve scale and reach for the best advertisers. There are lots of companies out there that want to work on the same problems, but we believe these can’t be won easily,” Draper said in a statement. “A lot better tools and partners means that these companies have an advantage over competitors because our focus is on data to make a lasting relationship with consumers.”
The investment is another round for Deep Fork Capital, Draper’s first of the company’s eight to date.
The company was founded back in 2013 by Tim O’Leary, who was an early investor in Quora, LinkedIn, and Facebook, as well as founders Nicol Barra and Matt Jarre of Squrl.com, Barra’s employer.
The company also recently announced partnerships with the likes of Shopify and Poshmark to power sponsored search results on behalf of brands and retailers.
Earlier this year O’Leary was appointed CEO by Amazon Web Services, a role he left over the summer to focus more on the more traditional role of VP of Engineering and Operations, after a two-year stint with the AWS platform.
A LinkedIn spokesman told TechCrunch that that the board “decided that it was important for O’Leary’s experience to contribute at more time than he would have spent at AWS”.
“This represents O’Leary’s third and final time at AWS and we think he will benefit from that experience and understanding of the AWS platform and the resources at Deep Fork Capital to help accelerate the growth of the company,” the says the spokeswoman. It was, too, his third time in the role. The company says the move was based on O’Leary “rejoining them in a great way”."
"Samanage, a social review platform aimed at businesses, wants to disrupt existing review platforms by not only offering a mobile app for online stores to better serve customers but also initiating and engaging conversations around their products, even if that’s by way of an app.
“A lot of times we look at the mobile device and think ‘what is it we’re looking at here?’ but there’s a lot of things that customers want to engage with in the app, as well as the way that we treat ourselves,” says co-founder and CEO Chris Weafer.
“And what we’re trying to do is we’re thinking the way the way people engage with products in the app is with talking and talking, and so forth. So it’s really about personalization more than just a photo of a product. And it’s a lot of fun to actually talk with product people.”
With this idea in mind, the app-based service launched this morning is already being used by businesses that want to market in China, and is now making its way to the U.S.
One of the customer stitching the feature out, Weafer says, is Jumia Motors, the China shippers and logistics businesses that have set up operations on the messaging platform.
Another business that has already tied itself to Sinaa as a channel for commerce, says that it’s also “really focused” on leveraging its platform as a way to tap into the growing internet-based commerce market in China. That business is also currently utilizing Samanage to develop tools for its staff to better market to prospective sales partners and managers, according to Weafer and other co-founder Jason Baptiste.

As for a full list of the major changes? The biggest comes in version 3.0, which adds a number of small enhancements or just about every one, most of which are minor. But even the most minor one gets a big update, and version 3.0 was a major one, so there was a big change in this version, too. A few others had an even bigger change, too.
After version 3.0 came out, one area that seemed to change was the “Auto-updating” feature, which now displays when you are about to go into settings or other settings, allowing you to set Auto-Updating to automatically update the settings automatically. I’dd been a little confused about the “Auto-updating” option, but I understand why it’s now there.
In the 3.0 update, there’s also been a little tweak here and there that goes in the right direction. For once, the default settings in Auto-updating were:
auto-updating has been a little interesting in my experience with this product. If the product does come in handy for a lot of people, even though it’s not an automatic feature, at first glance, it’s a neat implementation, and I’ll definitely be using it again. But for me, it makes me wonder if there’s a larger update coming in the near future, too.
Still, there have been quite a few other minor changes that I can’t name, like when you can now swipe through the notifications to see more info before they pop up automatically. This is something that is pretty much the last that would really come into play if users were forced to use this feature in the initial version. Instead, it’s nice to note changes like the aforementioned Auto-updating auto-updating, then compare it to the changes we’ve now seen on Android’s version of Notification Center.
I am still looking around for more minor changes that would affect this product before hitting a big 3.0 upgrade. This has been the longest of those updates that have been put into action, however."
"Apple is having a new patent application published today by USPTO and it looks like there’s another patent filing related to that concept being filed with the USPTO. When it looks like patents are often released to the public, it makes sense to add some more details when we’re hoping to see new Apple patents filed. One of the most interesting aspect that new patent filing is doing is getting more of the same thing that we’ve seen from Apple filed over the years, as we would expect it coming out before anything else.
Specifically, according to Apple, the patent description could show the following:
The Patent describes a device for displaying a window into the real world, complete with light and color, colors, and even depth. The device could be used in indoor and outdoor environments, but is most likely to be in high-end settings. The device is shown off in the patent filing, including in an interactive prototype that was recently used at Apple’s WWDC to demonstrate the capabilities of the tech. The prototype used a projector and color display to make it look like a real-life environment.
The company was using Apple’s own patents to make its own prototypes in the wild before bringing it into the public domain. This patent filing includes several patents of the sort that would make it even more interesting, as first reported earlier today.
The patent also talks about a projector system for creating an interactive display, as well as how multiple displays could be used in conjunction with one projector. The patent describes a combination system to display multiple display and color elements, with a single display used as a front-end for a system that lets the projector control the actual display and color components, while the two displays control the pixels and pixels of the image. Apple’s camera is also said to be able to read multiple color sensors simultaneously, so in theory better color processing in general.
The patent describes multiple sizes for the projector, but the only one, shown in the patent, is a medium-sized 7-15x7.3-inch one. Those two would be at minimum, though the patent describes 16 to 28 inches, and notes that the smaller sizes could form the basis of an entire system, with 32×32 inches and 128×64 inches.
So, why exactly is this going to be interesting? Because of the name, which stands for “pen”. It is an interesting idea, regardless, and at first glance it seems that this could really be a product design. For a long enough time, color-sensitive displays were a problem for Apple with their older models (it seems that one reason why Apple hasn’t been using color-sensitive on-screen technology) and that was a big problem for them to tackle.

 Bosanovic, a product manager at Facebook.

But if there is one thing they will keep fighting, it’s a personal story that started brewing in late 2011 when they were introduced to a company named Rhapsody and later revealed in a lawsuit filed by Rhapsody founder and CEO Michael M. Glazer against Spotify.
He had bought his wife, Maquilha, a friend of his who was a music producer. They had met at a local diner and had planned a joint band. The band had played a few concerts, and was rumored to be the most popular band of the year in the US.
“The song was just like every other band,” Glazer told me on Tuesday.
The two had planned to meet one another on the music show next to each other on the CBS channel in Boulder, Colorado. There, while discussing a few different bands and bands of the year, an announcement was made that the two companies were in hot contention.
They were set up to meet privately. But something happened which was not intended, according to a source for both parties.

“The thing that really angered Glazer was that he was told not to be late for the show at that meeting next to his,” said a source. “When Maquilha heard the news and she was excited to meet with him, she thought ‘if you are going to be here, and you are not going to be late, let’s just do it.”
Instead of actually buying the ticket for the next show on the calendar, the two decided to just sit down, chat briefly and then get down to it.
“‘I’m at your concert, but I want to make sure I get to see you later,’” said Glazer.

Glazer was later revealed to be the first employee at an LA-based digital company that was later sold to Apple in 2010 to the company behind Beats Music earlier this year. Glazer stayed on after the sale, and now, according to his family, has yet to be recruited as a member of the organization.
It’s a small matter when you think of the bigger picture, but the two came together to build what is now Pandora.
“We are both very geeky,” Glazer said.

There is only one person that is credited with leading that effort, Glazer said. The band’s manager, David Wechseler, who also happens to be an accomplished musician. “We were really excited to have him involved,” Glazer said. “We wanted to have every single day of that tour just be a “thank you” to him. So, at the end of every day, we had every single day of every day in front of us on our phone, saying ‘how do we show you this picture,’ because that’s an incredible experience that you’re at.”
Eventually, the two started to talk a bit. They would chat about music and life.
“The fact that you are two guys talking the same shows in front of you all together is really amazing,” Glazer said.
And then something remarkable happened. The first day after they told each other that they were going to be getting together and doing things together. “We had that conversation every single day,” Glazer said. “It was so exciting and exciting to go away from all things happening at once and try to do this.”
The two started talking on a topic called ‘The Swag,’ which is just something they do to celebrate music, as there are many musicians that don’t.
While the two were initially meeting with each other in person, they began talking over the phone.
“It was really cool, but when you do it in person, it’s not a really pleasant experience,” Glazer said. “You have to talk to the person who it was.”
And while it was fun to see that things were going well, there were a couple of things that became apparent to everyone.
For example, when people ask you for directions, you have to tell them where you are going. So, when you are doing something alone, you have to be very specific. There was also a strange feeling. “I don’t remember having an umbrella or anything as you’ve always worn in public, as I’m always carrying a bag,” Glazer said. “You are using a very public bar in front of a bar.”
This was hard for him to do because the bar was very formal. The bar was very professional. There were hundreds of people.
When you are part of a community that is very professional and a very focused group, you want to share

But if this is a real enterprise that grows, I’ma be honest, I’m not so sure what Facebook is actually doing. Maybe it’s being good at growing with other companies. But maybe it’s not that simple. It’s about making money by staying in California. And that’s the point of this blog post:
Yes, to give you an approximation of how much the companies were taking in, here’s Google:

Google’s revenues are growing quickly in New York, but those growth numbers are based on other industries, like search. So yes, the growth numbers aren’t completely reflective of the U.S. economy.
That’s still good, but it’s interesting to see that Facebook was the fastest-growing company in U.S. history, as well, and in doing that Facebook’s share of the American economy is being eroded over time. As a result, Facebook’s share of the economy could be declining, which could have a negative impact on how the company operates as a U.S. company, and that has all the potential for its global growth.
For a deeper look, see this graphic:


[Note: After running the numbers we’ve noticed that Facebook is the fastest-growing e-commerce company as reported by the Wall Street Journal in its March report here. The growth numbers indicate this fact is a real issue for the company, which is still far from its first quarter earnings report. After some digging, it sounds as if social has been a primary driver of the growth in New York. It’s like a business is trying to keep its revenue share from getting negative as well as positive. This shows that for a few quarters, Facebook has been in a different league than it is now in.
The growth of these mobile users, which are not mobile-only (that means they use mobile devices much more than desktop). There are 5.8 percent, and that includes 5.6 percent in the U.S. and 5.7 percent in Latin America and 1.8 percent global growth.]
For example, a user that came to the United States in March was an e-commerce company (using commerce services on a monthly basis). The same user on the U.S. was an e-commerce company. In the U.S. users bought a product on Facebook. This app was part of that user’s purchase experience. It shows Facebook’s advantage when it comes to developing and developing out mobile commerce.
Another example is a customer that visited Brazil in March, who was a doctor. His experience was in the cloud-based software market, with cloud-based services, and his friends are in the same office. On his laptop, he visited a doctor and ended up buying the entire book of medicine for his patient.
Then we had the CEO of Facebook selling some of Facebook’s shares for several months when I came to the U.S. In April, he got his shares on the NASDAQ as well, selling stock as well as its common stock. He sold shares at a loss.
So Facebook’s growth has a global focus, and that’s an important theme for the company. At its core, it is a fast-growing company. But as we see more U.S. companies get involved in business activities, and get richer, the company will continue to grow. Maybe the “Facebook economy” will grow even better in the U.S. for the next few years?"
"Last week, Facebook was getting a lot quieter of late. Its ‘FbFeed’ service — the feed where posts from friends would appear like a feed of links, but would instead appear as a white notification and appear at the bottom of the page — was completely removed. Now, it’s gone, too. The main ‘FbFeed’ site is gone and the ‘FbFeed’ mobile app disappeared last week. I’ve also heard that the “FbFeed” service has been shut down for some time. I’m also told that the company has made an effort to keep all of its employees from work, in the shape of a “lock-down”, where employees, including Head of Product Kevin Weil, haven’t actually been housed. And that all of Facebook’s products have been bought and shut down.
Facebook’s business model with advertising relies on people telling friends for revenue share. It had to make money from those referrals or money from ads on other platforms. It made money from ads on Facebook, and revenue from sharing widgets. It made money from app install ads to monetize the installs by getting ads embedded in social browsing and

 buy.

We are still waiting for them to accept their offer. We will also be reaching out with them if this is useful to them.
When will all the partners agree to come back? We’ll be watching to see. And let you know what is going on inside the organization to get your cash when your credit card expires.
TechCrunch: Who are your competitors?
Yossi Taray: The deal could open up more opportunities to partners to offer to help startups with marketing and business development.
TC: What are your immediate plans?
Yossi Taray: We will focus on our two markets to date: the US and Israel and our partners in China will be using our APIs so that they can offer marketing services to their clients when these opportunities are most appropriate to them.
The goal is to provide one of two solutions. You can get your investors to provide money, or you can find other sources in the market that are interested.
We are in a different category compared to a traditional venture fund. Typically we invest in a vertical industry to find a good partner for your company to come back as a VC. We only invest in companies that are able to raise the required funding to become a VC. We’re not looking for the VC money but the other ways out.
To date, our partners have come from Russia, China, the US and a number of other countries to invest from them as early stage investors to help startups.
In general, our investors are based in Russia, USA, the Middle East, Israel etc. Most of our investors do not come from Russia, Ukraine or China. Some of these people come after their partners in the venture room, but as time goes more these people are the main contributors.
TC: What if the partners won’t follow your plan?
Yossi Taray: A bit of an unusual request as we have quite a few people who are working on a large, successful venture company and are doing great job in a very different context from a few startups at the accelerator. We’re providing an alternative for them.
One of our challenges is our customers expect the very best experience for startups. One of our most important target is the VC industry. So some of our partnerships have been in the area of VC. We are working on realtime, open source and cloud-based services with our partners.
And we do not plan to continue with VC because of the very different financing environment. A VC can use the best technology, get the best deals and develop a robust business model. However, he can’t really do both. The VC ecosystem is growing very large these days. Companies can not just raise huge amounts.
The main innovation happening now is how they are investing: a VC can bring a couple of clients, and invest in them in return. We want to create more opportunities like that to both grow more companies and attract new customers. We are also interested in how investors can better get good deals.
TC: Where are the partners from TechCrunch?
Yossi Taray: So far, our partners have been from Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, the US, Israel, Korea, the Middle East, the Silicon Valley, Moscow and other countries. Most of this, is to make it easier for startups to acquire the best resources possible. But we are also quite interested in the partners in countries that have an active, innovative VC ecosystem.
Investors from Russia have been mostly in the US where some entrepreneurs are building companies in the Valley. The Russians have started the accelerator in Kiev and the first batch there.

This will be a very interesting competition as all of the best startups of the past will be present. The winners will be selected by experts in the VC industry. Some will win money, some will be acquired by strategic partners, and some will be acquired by others. The first three companies in the competition will be acquired at different terms.
We are looking for interesting teams with great businesses. It’s up to the teams to make an impact. So the prize is a little bit of cash, but one way to make an impact is with good deals and a successful market.
TC: Are you the first VC accelerator in Russia to have raised more than $1M in recent three months? Why?
Yossi Taray: It’s the first accelerator in Russia to go for more than $1M annually in three months, not unlike the last cycle in Berlin.
TechCrunch: Who are the competition’s partners?
Yossi Taray: The competition will be led by VC companies and is very competitive. There is no “long runway”. Only 30% of startups get funded. Some of the companies are growing very fast; many of the startups get acquired. The average valuation of the acquisition is around $5M.
TC: The number of startups that are funded by TechCrunch?

 to add an external keyring for easy access to those devices.
To use the app, smartphone users have to download the latest version of the app, hit the Google Play store, sign in with Facebook or other login option and give the app access to their entire mobile phone set-up. The app will then recognize and download all your hardware devices, and automatically apply updates to them to your phone or computer.
You can then start with just a few actions, including selecting a color for the text, pressing F to access a shortcut that lets you quickly turn to your favorite fonts in the apps you already own, or just selecting “Done” to keep the font on the home screen and then hitting “OK to reboot the system.”


Once you’re done, you’ll have a few minutes to go through your Settings app on your computer, then your phone, pick the fonts you like and then your phone automatically applies the custom font to whatever you selected.
The Android version of the text also includes a number of Google Now cards on the screen showing you all the details and actions you could perform, such as texting a friend to ask them to lunch, or using the dialer with the app on.

The font changes can be seen here as something of a demonstration (if your eye can catch it), so let us know what you think."
"In an effort to expand its reach out to the tech community, Twitter just acquired an Israeli company called Alignable. The startup, which helps companies improve their ability to engage their target demographic of Twitter users with in-stream content, has now made its way to Twitter’s mobile app."
"Twitter is ramping up the number of products it offers to users who want to engage with their brand — and it’s starting with some big names. Twitter announced yesterday that it would launch a brand loyalty platform, called the Hashtag Hashtag Club.
The company’s plans to offer more than a dozen products called Hashtag Personalization, Hashtag Radio and Hashtag Search, Hashtag Promo, Hashtag Alert, and Hashtag Radio, and Hashtag Search Plus. Each of these features will launch separately, but Hashtag Promo will become one of Twitter’s flagship apps.
Twitter announced the launch and integration of these new products after Hashtag Club members participated in two weeks of in-stream TV programs, called #Together. The company says Hashtag Radio received more than 900 episodes. This is Twitter’s first product from the Hashtag Club, a company that had previously sold its product to other companies. Hashtag Alert received more than 5,000 episodes within a month of launch.
Hashtag Search Plus, which has the added benefit of requiring advertisers to set up a Twitter account to allow for access to their clients, will be offered by Twitter AdWords. In other words, advertisers will be able to make purchases using the Hashtag Keyword.
As part of Twitter’s acquisition, AdWord will be one of those brands that will be included in the Hashtag club. Tweeters wishing to get paid “will be eligible for a new, free marketing service from Twitter AdWords,” Twitter noted in a new, free tweet advertising service.
For Twitter AdWords, advertisers will pay to promote one tweet per day. The advertisers will then get a commission on that tweet. Twitter will allow advertisers to make more money per tweet than it has on its own ad network.
And the “Flagship” feature that will let businesses offer campaigns that will encourage purchases from others, is being released into public beta. The idea is to help brands generate more audience through ad campaigns instead of requiring them to make a costly deal or buy ad retargets that could get them more engagement.

With the launch of Hashtag Radio, companies will now let brands and celebrities promote a new product called Hashtag Alert, which will let people of interest track your social media conversations with others who might like to follow them.
According to AdWord, it will have a slightly different name than AlertMe.
A Twitter executive pointed to the product as one way companies can better target their customers: “The ability to make Twitter marketing more valuable is not a feature, it’s a product that’s really powerful to brands in all their marketing channels.” In the company’s launch of AlertMe, advertisers will be able to more easily target their advertisers with messages and ad units on both Twitter and Facebook.
Twitter also introduced keyword ads that will let advertisers create more engaging content for more people. Twitter will pay a flat rate of $5 per keyword for advertisers who already have their campaign.
Twitter’s acquisitions, and those made by its partners, have had more than a half-dozen different uses: in particular, Twitter has been a go-to tool for the media for a long time with pre-roll

 Gigitor is available for $599.
To learn more about the new device, visit the site here. 
The device comes in four colors: black, or white, or red/black, so the customer can choose from different colors of red color options. The red light will emit an electrical charge at around $1.7K (about $0.59 in U.S. currency). I can also see the company using an RGBH4 version to deliver the higher price. 

Girolam described the device as providing a “great entry point into what’s possible with 4G/LTE; the more complex smartphones that we have are really not available at the moment.”"
"I have a confession. I used to play the PlayStation store on Microsoft’s Windows 8, and I’ve certainly never played the Final Battle of Frontiers. But today at Microsoft’s event, they’ve just announced the next generation of the device — a high-end version called the “Battlefield,” as well as a more portable version called the “Battlefield Portable,” aimed at players who’re outside the professional gaming community.
The Battlefield is a tablet-powered (a tablet if you must) device, which allows users to play games at 4 different sizes so long as they carry two controllers, all the way down to small tablets that can fit in the pocket. It will be available on the Microsoft Store starting this September. Pricing for the Battlefield is currently available at $649.
The company tells me that it doesn’t want to just create the standard-setting tablet experience for those who aren’t in the professional PC space, but wants to also make that experience simple. They’ve made a few tweaks to the tablet to make it easier to use, and Microsoft is also offering a bundle of a brand new hardware called the “HDMI Battlefield HD.” So if you’re just playing your Angry Birds, but you really want to play with the new device, I’d recommend grabbing a Battlefield and using the controller all the time or using the headset. I’m not a gamer, but you’ve probably seen me play games on a tablet for hours now on a lot of the various tablets and Windows 8 devices that’s the same size.
The Battlefield HD is slightly smaller than the original version, but the company says it’s the only version of the device out there that can run both sides of the tablet (a dual-core Cortex-M32 chip, and dual-band (with two-band support to play different bands, and one-handed usage (like on a PC), and that users can use it for both 2, 4, 8, 24 and 32GB models.
If you’re in need of a portable version, I’m sure that the Battlefield has something in stock.
The new Battlefield Tablet, which also have a price of $79, is a different product, and I’m also sure that you can probably expect to see more. It’s available from Microsoft, Best Buy and Amazon, with two controllers, a total of 16GB and a rechargeable Li Ion battery."
"When was the last time you talked about what your company needs to get a lot of money? While the company may seem familiar with a little of what those metrics look like, the way the company has presented them to you could not have been any better. But you were wrong: The company has been selling its business model to your investors and your family to deliver value – the promise to make money on the long tail of its products.
But that’s not all. The company has had a pretty rough time at the time of its IPO, too. It’s a year late, too.
The company had a rough outing compared to the numbers of investors who had placed its shares a month before, but it has been doing a little of those things well. The company has made a few additions to its staff. With its latest round of $25 million, the company is adding a head of product — Marc Andreessen — and it has been looking to build its customer support team within the next year.
The company told me:

Update: The company also tweeted out the following statement:

"Apple won’t be offering a new iOS 8.1 operating system this evening, but the iPhone SE will still support the new features introduced in iOS 9, which includes multiple features that debuted in iOS 8, like Spotlight Stories, Messages, and Apple Maps.
For better or for worse, Apple will continue to keep the same app name as we know it, with the updated iOS 8.0 and a host of minor bug fixes, for example. What’s new is now Apple has also announced a brand new operating system called Yosemite, it will debut on September 10th, at which point an official launch will begin, and we’ll be sure to watch to see when it goes live. The company promises that it will be launching Yosemite on 10th at this year’s launch, with a “few things to see” launch.
There’s a lot of news. Apple launched its first iOS update on the 9.5.x update two weeks ago, but hasn’t said what version of iOS 9 will launch tomorrow. The last version of the operating system will arrive on September 19th. So, unless Apple screws up its own servers, Apple can’t afford not to give us what it needs now.
A few months ago, Apple announced plans to introduce an operating system in the fall that will include new features that weren’t even possible when the company first debuted the operating system for the 8.0. The company’s new OS will run on the new A9 chip, as well as the A5 for iOS. The A5’s A9X chip is made up of ARM-based processors. The A9X should have 64-bits support, but the A9X will support 32-bit for now. That means these chips are actually faster than previous generations, Apple claims.
Meanwhile, the company will launch a new hardware SDK for developers on the company website later this month. Apple is already working with developers to bring OS features to their mobile devices. The new SDK will enable developers to include Siri search, Maps integration, as well as Apple Maps and more.
The launch of the iPhone SE will begin on September 10th with pre-orders, but will actually launch on the iPhone SE later on."
"Apple has been adding features to its iOS 7.x-running operating system since it began rolling out to iPhones last week, making sure that the entire device supports all the same features as you might find on mobile devices today. In iOS 7.x, Apple introduced the ability to quickly initiate iMessage, chat, and share notes, and also added several useful productivity features, including iWork and Health, for example.
This update is mostly technical, too – we haven’t yet seen a significant addition to the App Store, Apple announced that the update was making its way to existing all the new iOS 7.x devices running iOS 7.x, and it’s unclear whether the upgrade contains a new app, or whether users have been asked to install something entirely new in order for it to work properly, which happened about three days ago.
Apple has been rolling out iOS 7.x to existing, and current, users just by dropping in some minor changes. Now when you want to make edits to your own code, you can do it without having to go through extra manual approval. You can now select one of the more limited settings that are available by default, and then proceed to edit the code as needed. You’ll also need no manual approvals at all, which is handy when working on an iPhone update, and also a little more convenient when working on new versions of programs.
The updates today include an updated Settings app, an expanded camera to support pan and zoom, and a more advanced way to manage multitasking for devices running the new operating system."
"Apple’s appstore continues to go, with some new additions available in a new catalog of apps.
The company announced its own App Store of apps for iPhone today, updated for iOS 9.
First up is Apple Music, which the company says has been downloaded more than two million times in the last eight months, and serves 70 percent of all adult users of Apple’s listening experience. Another new addition is Apple Maps, where Apple added over 50,000 users to the database in less than five months, including more than one million users in just one day.
“As we continue to look at the App Store, this is an important data point to enable a greater understanding of what people are doing with Apple,” Apple Music and Apple Maps product marketing vice

 so that the app works with the local carrier. It means that the carrier also gets the same data access to your smartphone as if you were on its service. And the app is monetized through ads in your area, allowing it to earn money from selling data.
The idea that carriers are using data in their smartphone bundles and offer users other devices to download apps is not a new one. But the fact that your phone starts to look like an expensive dongle by the carrier is a new one.
According to Cogito, the company’s first device was a “free wireless router in the mobile market.”"
"As the Internet continues to mature, there’s a growing appetite for social services and services that cater specifically to those communities. 
That’s the promise behind a new application called Daimo, currently in private alpha testing with 100 to 200 users, designed for the social sharing economy.
Specifically, the founders said that “the Internet, as we know it, is going to be social.”
“People are on the Internet more so than ever before,” said co-founder Alex Raugen, “and even more ready to be social in the real world than ever before. As people are in front of cameras, they’re less likely to want to watch what they think.”
The goal, Raugen said, is to create an experience that’s a bit more than the usual social commenting stream or any other social sharing channel.
“Instead of seeing what someone said, and how they said it, you need to know their story,” Raugen said. “It’s not in your head. You need to know who they are. There’s a lot better content out there.”
The application works like a social diary, in other words, Raugen said it’s “an organized, social, social, social network.”
The team, which also includes several professional actors, is also working to build relationships with local communities. They’re raising $1 million in seed funding to keep the app in the market, but Raugen said there would be a way to charge for more of this feature, for example, allowing users to pay to build their own relationships with different communities.
Raugen said if the app were released in the market, they would be using the money to hire a team of people to work in the field, rather than build a proprietary, proprietary product. “We want them there,” he said.
The company has seven employees and is currently three offices, with the aim being to grow its business “in the region of two or three to three square-maj,” Raugen said. He didn’t specify any further details. As is the case, he said Daimo is still a work in progress.
It will be open to the public during the next couple of months. The team is planning to raise a small $100,000 seed round in the coming weeks."
"In 2009, Chris Perez took a business card and used it as a proxy for his co-founders.
“They would go to the grocery or the bank and say, ‘hey, here’s all my cards, and I can put them in the system,’ or I could just give them to my co-workers,’ Perez said. “It was like in the mists of the old earth, people had all these crazy ideas about how technology would change the world, but it was, as the people with their technology, we hadn’t seen that.”
When Perez left those days, he said there were “less” than 100 companies around the word “collaboration” in the business world, so he decided to start his own, and so he was born.
When Perez got into the startup world, he said there were “hundreds” of “collaborative businesses.” But Perez said he didn’t want to use any of them to support his current company, because he didn’t want to “sell them too far.”
Instead, Perez focused his efforts on building a service called “Collaboratory.” He said it’s “basically what the term is now that companies have to go through multiple iterations of the design process or at least to figure out how they think of how they want the product to work.”
Perez said there’s a huge need among enterprise companies, who don’t hire outside contractors. They’ve had no experience, but Perez said they do in fact use their own contractors but sometimes they do their own because of the expense of owning an office, and they don’t rely on

 can make it easier to save a certain piece of a recipe, like, a pot of water or something else that’s important or that goes into dishes you might like to use to make a particular soup or salad.
By adding in more automation software for recipe and meal planning, including a mobile app and mobile website, the company’s goal is to simplify what it means to have a recipe stand-in-front of you to provide the right recipe when you need it.
The new versions of the website also add an option for somewhat automatical cooking. Users can either browse recipes via the app or their website or simply tap on “find recipes” and quickly create and edit the recipe to your liking.
The websites also include recipes, including more complicated food-related recipes in addition to meals.
In addition, there are more than one million recipes on the site per month in categories like home cooking, and more than a million recipes in its database per week.
In the menu bar, users can navigate among other meal planning recipes, recipes, ingredients, recipes with photos, recipes to create a recipe, and more.
There’s also a new “Discover,” section on the website, which highlights recipes and other content related to a specific type of cooking or meal, as well as a blog post featuring recipes and other content that the site itself has crafted.
The other noteworthy change that’s included is the ability in the site to add a special ingredient to a recipe, like Soy Sauce. When you use the original recipe search option, the website includes a table of ingredients you can use to make the recipe, which automatically shows up in the search box. You can also add ingredients directly, and you can also select a particular ingredient to add to an existing recipe.
With the new version of the design, users will now be able to add photos on Flickr, Facebook and Picasa and the website now includes the ability to upload photos to Flickr or save images on your Instagram account. For food, users can now select and add a recipe.
With the new versions of the website, there’s already a bit of a learning curve, but the website isn’t necessarily too complex. Plus, the new recipes, too, offer a different way of cooking, but also bring convenience to a variety of casserries and other recipes.
The new version of the website is available on Apple’s App Store, as well as on Amazon App Store and Google Play."
"Bose has a plan to win over consumers who use their devices in the bedroom thanks to audio-powered remotes, but most women are still largely stuck with Bluetooth remotes. A new app called The Whistle aims to turn that trend on its head with a voice-controlled device that’s small, and thus, probably more portable and less complex to use than Bluetooth speakers. It launched last week at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2014’s Hackathon, and has since received $500,000 in seed funding from a number of different investors.

 
 
The Whistle, if you haven’t yet learned to use it yet, is a small speaker that has two modes. One is the standard, single-party mode, where it’s not tied to the iPad, phone, or anything else. The Whistle splits in two, with the right side dedicated to entertainment, the left for communication, and a speaker, mic, remote control and control.
The other is what’s called “audio party mode,” which is the place where people can send live radio, and the way it’s paired with The Whistle will be interesting as it’s not a regular phone or tablet. The Whistle’s user interfaces are customizable, as are its apps, but its biggest challenge seems to be not only convincing women to join, but staying out of trouble – there was a fair amount of criticism toward the original Whistle, such as the fact that it had a low rating, and even the way people use their phone as they normally would in this sort of situations.

The Whistle is completely speaker-compatible, and in fact it’s fully portable and not necessarily attached to other furniture. However, in a demo on Monday, a man standing on stage took a photo of it with a picture of the iPod, a notebook, and a laptop on the ground, only to find that the speaker had been stolen in plain view. A quick search of Craigslist will give you much more information about what sort of items people may, in fact, have their own inventory.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Android’s social network, Facebook, to get a feel for the types of features in Instagram? Or perhaps it’s something like that, but it’s also not something I want to see ever in the real world until I’m convinced there’s an app for it…and I have no idea why anyone’s thought of it. (See my “Is a photo worth looking at?” question below. Thanks.) 
That said, it’s certainly a useful feature – I’ve been trying out the interface for a while on Twitter and, since it’s like the ability to “post” your photo, not just your profile, it’ll be a great way to connect with your friends. 
You can see a couple of other “post” photos below.
If you want a photo to be shared, you can request it in the photo editor section. As well as a link, you can also select to be seen in the feed, or just view it in the feed. You can also select to be shown in your new Instagram feed, or simply tap on the blue link (below) to bring up the Instagram section. 

The most useful thing about Insta-Photos, however, is that it’s not just about finding an app, but getting your followers on the Instagram network to take a look. For these followers, you get a simple way to get their names, profile picture and link. This lets them use Instagram as normal and it’s a much better experience than having to email or text them. 
Instagram is still looking for that many powerful photos that come with the filter, but Instagram’s team seems to be very excited about the ability to get to your Instagram feed from Instagram.
There’s lots of room for innovation and there’s potential in this data, but it’s a shame that Instagram doesn’t have a good version of Instagram, if what’s already in there is useful. Plus, the ability to choose a filter (a “3-tiles” of your most popular images) is a huge new feature. 
Insta-Photos also integrates with Facebook in some way, but it’s a little bit of a weird workaround I’ve heard from the team:

However, the most notable new feature here would be that photo filtering, which lets you decide whether or not you want to appear in the feed, which is a nice feature but not quite as big as the Instagram filters themselves.
Instagram has always been the first app to allow you to filter photos, so there’s no reason they couldn’t also do it with Instagram Pictures. However, since Instagram’s filters have so much more power and flexibility than any Instagrammer, a filter would really help them turn back some of the Instagrammers’ filters, which is a shame.
If Instagram wants to give you filters, they’ll be able to share them and then share that to Instagram to give you a choice about whether you see them in your feeds or not.
However, Instagram filters are a bit of an awkward move. If they want you to see them in order to filter them, they can also decide where to show them.
There aren’t exactly many filters out there that let you choose a filter, especially since it’s not a matter of swiping, and you really only have about five options in the photos themselves. It’s still a very strong option and a nice addition though, though if I have to choose, I’m going to have to be forced to find a filter to add them. 
It’s the same reason Instagram is limited to users with a certain number of filters – a product with so many options, only a small subset of them will make the selection. If you only have five choice items, you’ll just ignore Instagram altogether. Which is good, if you want the best filter that comes with every filter (which I do) then you can’t do that.
There’s a reason why Instagram filters won’t have an iPhone app at all. The team was working on the product and knew there’d be a lot of bugs and crashes related to Instagram’s photo-filtering feature that would impact the overall experience. Plus, they say that since Instagram’s not perfect, users shouldn’t expect perfect, which is always a hard thing to accept.
With Instagram filters in place, Instagram is now an attractive destination which is accessible on any computer – and it’s also a place that has a decent amount of content for everyone. To some, Instagram will probably prove its worth, and to others, that’s just a way to get more people on the platform.

 very a challenge as you’re launching a social network. You don’t have an official API, you don’t have a website. There’s no way to send a tweet, an email, an RSS feed item in the feed, a blog post, etc.
How did you come up with it? And how did you make a decision?
Facebook: I’m constantly learning new ways to use the Internet. I’m looking for the perfect way to let you use the Internet, make it useful, and share. In our case, by looking at the way our product was being used. Many people are using us for the same reason – to share the joy that comes from making the Internet available to them. It makes my life easier. It also makes it fun. Like what you’ve been doing is an exciting, exciting experience. We hope you take advantage.
How did you come here?
Facebook: To be a part of the future in the Internet, we need to make the Internet great, as well. Many of my friends were also passionate about the idea of creating a global community powered by technology and technology. So we decided it’d be a good idea to make a go.
How did you become a product company? 
Facebook: A very good idea? I’m not sure. I’m very impressed that you and Facebook have created a new way for sharing stories. We really hope this starts a new trend and makes the Internet great. It’s an exciting time to be alive.

"This week at the TechCrunch Disrupt SF in San Francisco, the company had just announced the availability of its new Android app, and also revealed some of the new talent to join the team. The company also debuted its iOS app, and also announced a partnership with the brand JBL to turn their “hundreds of millions” of fan-created, and sometimes controversial, YouTube videos into the brand’s own audio commercials.
A new ad for a young, handsome new employee at Microsoft also debuted at Disrupt, and a brand new “social” ad for a young, handsome new employee at Spotify also debuted.
Finally, the company announced a free mobile app, launched as a beta, for iPhone and Android smartphones. The paid app, which is already live in the iTunes App Store, lets users create up to 30-second audio commercials. The app also allows users to customize how their ads “sound”, too, by adding a voice, or by adding a special FX tag to their ad for each person they’re calling. And, as a bonus, the app is just the perfect timing for the release of the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, and 6s models.
However, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
The company is also working on more mobile products, as well, and has plans to expand its partnerships with Apple TV, Amazon devices, as well as Roku and other devices.
“The iPhone has helped to make it impossible to stop what you’re doing now,'” a company VP told TechCrunch about the new iOS app today. “Now you can just say ‘check this' instead of a specific hashtag for a specific keyword.”
In short, the new mobile app sounds like a good product, but we’ve reached out to Microsoft for more details, but have yet to hear back.
The story came of course from TechCrunch’s John Beck, who’s had a personal relationship with John Sillerman, so naturally had his own version of the story on his phone for when he was looking for the story.
While we’ll see how this story fares out in the first place, our own Matt Burns also got into the mix and was the guy at the front of the line at Disrupt. (Burn was also a high school coach in high school, so I asked why the company chose to put him on stage to talk about the app?)

Meanwhile, I’ve reached out to Microsoft to hear what he had to say and will let you answer that question in future. In fact, I asked whether they could describe the new app’s use of Twitter search. “We believe that Twitter search, which we developed based on a number of third-party Twitter and Facebook APIs, is the new social discovery engine,” a Microsoft spokesperson told me in an email, before I had to dig deeper and get down to my notes."
"As the smartphone industry continues to heat up, and the new iPhone continues to enter the market, a number of players are looking to grab market share — and, as a result, to generate revenues. Today,

ified for two-factor authentication with one or multiple account-holders.” She also added that while the new feature is coming to existing accounts it’s not allowing other apps to use that mechanism.
The integration with Twilio comes at a time when both Facebook and Google are looking for ways of making their products more accessible to developers. Last week, for instance, Facebook merged its Messenger service with a new feature that lets users share their voice over SMS (a first since Facebook’s voice communication platform was acquired by Google).
This is obviously a huge move and an important one for Twilio, which, as of last week, had over 600 million users. However, it’s also coming just ahead of Twitter, which has a huge presence in mobile in the form of apps for iPhone and Android devices.
Twilio was also one of the first companies to integrate with Messenger, and the company is building on that foundation as it develops other business and, of course, its Twilio Mobile service.
Facebook’s new SMS features are available in English, Spanish, French, German, Dutch, French Telecom, Orange, T-Mobile, Vodafone, and Telefonica’s O2 (a competitor to Orange’s Orange Talk), and Orange’s Orange Talk is available (as is Orange Talk on Android tablets) as well. The new features will come to other devices and regions, too.

Facebook Messenger will be part of all of Facebook’s features available as part of its platform with over 70 million daily users today. Facebook says that in total the new features will support 10 million different languages.
However, that’s only the start. At the end of June, Facebook launched a much broader rollout of its new voice and video features, starting with Skype and the iPhone-slinging app of the same name.
This is not the first time that Facebook has invested heavily in an area related to video and voice communications. Last month, the social network launched a VoIP service which will let users have either a webcam camera or microphone connected to their smartphones to take and record video. And recently, Facebook has invested in the startup Rapid, another startup building out services to help brands better integrate apps and cloud services into their business.
These are not all of these investments but these are a few areas that show just how much attention Facebook is getting paid to this area, and also how much money is pouring into startups like Rapid and WhatsApp.
In addition to SMS, Facebook Messenger is now a part of how many platforms are working on their own VoIP offerings. The company, recently acquired by Facebook for $19 billion in a deal that included Snapcash and several other payments moves, has also been aggressively investing in how it works on desktop as well, and how it might potentially work more closely with Microsoft’s Windows Phone platform moving forward. The company has bought into Skype, and as of last week, it is offering the same voice functionality that its platform currently offers on the web."
"One of the many questions facing any app building today is how to bring users to the app with the most value for them. For a long time, it’s been hard to break out of the mobile app cycle from the desktop and just build content from inside mobile apps, often requiring an effort of weeks. Meanwhile, on desktop, Google has made the Chromebook and the Firefox browser for PC, making it easier for companies to break out of their desktop apps and begin using the services.
But on mobile, it still requires developers to get users to the app before they’ll get distracted by content. It’s not that difficult: Google Play Books recently opened its own version of the Play Store to Chrome and Firefox for Windows, with an emphasis on content discovery via search. This is particularly important in apps where users have been conditioned to read, surf and then return to apps.
And a majority of Android apps are still locked inside “protected folders,” Google says.
Today, the answer is still to build out apps that work across mobile devices for Chrome and Firefox OS, but Google is also launching a new type of app to do the same thing: It provides a “mobile-first” experience that’s optimized for touch and apps.
For a week, Chrome will not be available in Android apps, while Firefox will remain the Google Play Books app for Firefox OS.

In Android apps, the new experience is tailored for users, in terms of design and navigation. Instead of needing to tap and swipe to go back to a previously opened app, Chrome now lets you navigate back to your app from within Chrome.
In addition to the standard navigation, there is a shortcut to the right from the home menu that pops up in an enlarged list of icons.
In addition, there is a new widget of sorts

 a very good way to showcase all the things you could do right away.
That said, there’s still enough utility left in its app that if you end up finding it to be annoying and get frustrated by a bunch of small details, and if you end up not using it, you can just move on to the next thing, like printing a photo or commenting. Plus, since the focus is on photos and not design, it’s easy to move between photos. (On Android, this is called “Predictively sorting photos,” which is really just the same as just “photo organizing.”)

And like I said above, Swiftly has a couple of tricks up its sleeve. For starters, it’s the biggest of them all. Swiftly’s own logo looks like it’s written in watercolor, and has that bright, white, metallic red color that just doesn’t go well with grayish color gradients, but in fact it looks a bit like you’ve painted it, like an Instagram feed, or even photo-led slideshow.
As I mentioned above, Swiftly lets you quickly add photos to slideshows, create visual slideshows, rearrange photos based on time and location, and more.
In just one tap, you can create a video slideshow. In addition to selecting a length, you can choose from pre-set playlists that let you add up to 200 different videos to a single screen.
While iOS has been a major boon to photo-based social applications, it’s one of iOS that has seen an even bigger push into digital photo-sharing. In fact, iOS has actually been a major force in digital photo-sharing, with a number of photo-sharing apps from popular services like Instagram and Viddy being available for free via various means. Similarly, apps like Stickybits don’t require an account, but rather allow you to use photos you’ve taken before to create cool, animated collages and videos as you go, and they allow you to share to Facebook (if you’ve uploaded your own photos), email (if you choose to be an uploader of your own photo-receited feed), SMS (on iPad & iPad) and Facebook’s own social network (on iPad) at any time.
In addition, because Swiftly is so focused on photos, it’s a great way to browse through all the photo-related photos you’ve shared on Facebook, and to browse through all the photo-related photo-recreations you’ve created to date on your other services, like Instagram and Vecteo. You can also browse through your photo archive and view those whose photos you have uploaded before, and, with a few taps, save things for posterity.
The app itself is nicely designed, with the focus on photography and the way it’s designed to be simple to use with minimal help. As someone who’s done a fair amount of photos and videos, and who likes everything I’ve shared but never really posted on Facebook, I’d say Swiftly is a definite improvement.
The new Swiftly app is out now on all iOS. An Android app is also in the works."
"When Instagram was new, the media would get the idea that there was some serious competition in the space. It really was a big deal when it launched and that’s how it’s going to stay. But over time, there’s been a shift from social networking with one or a few friends supporting their interests with a whole new generation who grew up on their devices. Today, almost 10 million users have amassed a total of 100 million photos and videos, and that’s not including “re-shared” photos.
The key to Instagram’s success has been focusing on getting these videos created, and then allowing those to share via instant messaging, instant webcams, video conferencing, and more platforms and services that push them beyond the walls of Instagram. It’s been a big transition period for the company.
After announcing that it would launch video chat and web conferencing support three years ago, the company has been slowly moving towards its goal of being a platform, not a destination for content. On that front, Instagram added video capture and chat support on Android and iOS, and built out mobile conferencing support and web conferencing. It’s the reason that Instagram acquired Snapchat. And perhaps, because it’d built that business. (For what it’s worth, Instagram didn’t invest in Snapchat, which Facebook owns) and perhaps, because it doesn’t need to own its own services as much as it could.
But for a lot of us at Instagram, there’s a feeling that the company’s continued

 quality of life and enjoyment and also has the potential to change how we spend our lives, we’re still very much humans.”"
"Grouper, which is making your life easier, just released its mobile app for iOS. Now, you can use the app to find a local “gym” that suits you, ask the person at the gym for their name, find gyms nearby, set up group workout sessions, and more.
The iOS version of the app comes out today, while Android is coming soon, and the Android update will likely arrive “next week.”
And the Android app gets a pretty cool upgrade as well, as well. You can use GymCoach to track your activity and health metrics. GymCoach isn’t just a workout platform, either, and it will also track fitness plans, nutrition, and more.
Meanwhile, members can share their exercise activity via social media, which allows them to share workouts, log their progress, view their stats, see how they compare to the competition, and more.
Grouper has over a million users, according to cofounder and CEO Ryo Chiba, citing a recent survey by Mediacell. The company has also made a big move into the college market thanks to a partnership with the American College Counseling Association (AAAss) — that’s a group of experts who help college students make healthier choices and navigate this process. Last year, AA Assoc. also released its own app for iOS, GymCoach.
The iPhone app is available here on iTunes. The Android app should arrive “soon,” Chiba says. But the new Android app will launch in mid-March.
Update: I’m hearing that GymCoach could take inspiration from another startup that goes way deeper than a social app. The app itself is called Fitiquette, and it’s a completely different experience. (I used to write about it once a week when it came to mobile.) GymCoach could give its members a dashboard to track their exercise activity and other metrics. But the app could also help you make healthier choices and make plans for yourself, too.
You can download the gym app here."
"You might not be familiar with the name, but one of the best things about the mobile messaging space, and especially in mobile-first settings like Twitter, is the fact that it’s so fast and easy to get started. If it sounds like the mobile equivalent of Slack, then that’s partly true, and partly because it’s very easy — and mobile messaging itself is often the best way to do things that, traditionally, require the traditional desktop-based software.
But, in spite of all that, the iOS app of the week keeps finding new, innovative uses for its messaging platform. And today, the folks at CeeChat have been doing just the kind of thing WhatsApp on Mobile. They’ve launched and are ready to share their iOS and Android app for iOS, complete with a few new features.
Launched on December 11th, the Chicago-based startup has already seen quite a few upgrades to their iOS app, with the addition of the speed boost feature, quicker image uploader for better image search and sharing, as well as the ability to use the camera to quickly send your messages.
So why go through CeeChat?
Co-founder and CEO Brett Vogel tells us that the team’s own use cases are quite straightforward — their existing users are on smartphones. Ceesamote is, of course, an email platform that’s built specifically for mobile. (Yes, that’s right.) And when Ceesamote had their beta launch in September, the launch meant that Ceesumote had been working for just 24 hours.
But today with a new beta push, customers are starting to catch up on the CeeChat platform. Vogel tells us that the app has picked up 5,000 downloads since launch (up from 2,000 in July), though he couldn’t provide any hard figures on app installs or active users at this time. (You can also read all of these apps’ blog posts.) So, it seems like Ceesummote has amassed some very different user types, including users from just about the U.S., Latin America and Asia. That’s probably because Vogel is an American who only recently moved to Europe, and the teams has been working to localize Ceesumote for the big screen, but the end result is a much better user experience.
In total, Vogel says that Ceesummote has seen 100,000 downloads this year, and that a big chunk of that data is being pushed to third-party services from Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest in the form of a push notifications API. And, Vogel says, they also try to target a younger audience, who doesn’t

 into a new era of social. In the next few decades, social changes will bring a new wave of technology and a new wave of social-enabled companies. While the impact that social technology will have has the largest impact on the economic health, health care, education, healthcare, etc, the impact of all the new technologies will have the biggest impact that impacts any other industry.
What’s more, most of today’s most critical healthcare concerns revolve around the Internet access to healthcare information. In the near-future, we will have a plethora of ways to make and receive this information. Social technology will lead to new networks of communication and to applications for healthcare services that are more powerful and advanced than ever.
In short, Social technology is transforming healthcare. The Internet will increase the number of care providers, increase the quality and quantity of care, and significantly improve care delivery. Social technology will create new opportunities for healthcare providers and increase access to healthcare services by connecting physicians and hospitals to their patient profiles, medical networks, and medical information.
Social media is changing medicine by making healthcare information available to millions. Social technology creates new opportunities for hospitals in the form of better and cheaper ways to manage patient information, by improving care delivery to patients, and by improving healthcare outcomes to their patients.
The Internet’s impact will have the largest impact on healthcare providers, not only treating patients. Social technology will also transform the hospital and the healthcare providers themselves. Social technology can lead to new hospitals and healthcare providers that are more efficient, capable of providing better and more affordable care, and that will provide additional incentives for their physicians and patients.
I believe that Social Technology is creating the best possible experience for patients. I don’t think that patients should expect everything the same as everyone else, and the only way to go is through education and information.
The goal of healthcare reform is to deliver care to patients at a lower cost than the other services available today. Healthcare providers will save an estimated 30 million dollars each year, and Social Technology will create millions of opportunities for healthcare providers. Social technology and healthcare providers in general will find that the cost of care, and therefore its quality, will fall in line with the quality and quality of care in society and beyond that of other services that currently exist.
As Social Technology reduces the cost of care, and the quality of medical care improves, Social Technology is democratizing access to care. By delivering healthcare services to thousands of patients around the world, Social Technology is transforming the quality of care at the bottom of the economic pyramid into the top. The best analogy is in the case of personal transportation.
The Internet will reduce the prices and the quality of care for healthcare providers, increasing their ability to deliver healthy and affordable care to patients. This includes making the purchase decisions a patient has to make the best for their health care; providing care as a service that patients can take themselves, while still taking care of their own health at their own home/home; providing affordable co-pays that meet a majority of Americans’ or even American Health Care Agency’s (AHCA) and the U.K. government’s standards; and reducing the costs of healthcare in the hospital by allowing health care providers to offer free, quality and low-price plans, all with one click and no additional phone calls and texting.
Today, the biggest challenge for healthcare is that it is so complex and the costs of care are much higher than many assume, and that it is often too complex to understand. Social technology will solve a few technical problems but make healthcare more complex from another perspective.
Today, the majority of healthcare providers are on the Web in the sense they are now using Facebook and other tools that automate their marketing and customer service to provide better and more accurate information and better communications about the healthcare situation. Social technology will improve the quality and quality of care, allowing it to be cheaper for healthcare providers and more effective.
For healthcare providers, Social technology is creating the opportunity to provide personalized and integrated care with better choices by reducing the costs of care while increasing the quality of care to improve outcomes for patients. Social technology will not create any new costs for patients if it enables them to find out better healthcare plans based on their own profiles and preferences, or to make certain choices based on the healthcare information they receive.
For healthcare businesses, Social technology gives them access to their most essential and most important resource — what is more, their very core and most precious asset — that will make them more competitive and will lead to a faster, more innovative and attractive approach to providing care at lower cost at improved quality and less time-on-site. The best example of this is the fact that healthcare technology has made it possible for healthcare providers to provide low-cost co-pays for their patients, which allow them to compete against the big players offering much more attractive (read: high-end) plans at lower cost for consumers and at higher quality and quality of care for consumers.
Social technology and Healthcare.

 the customer’s preferred solution.
However, in a new test conducted with Twitter data, an error with an “OKAY” button will result in the “OKAY” button being canceled, too, though the company notes it is still testing the feature. Still in the experimental phase, Twitter is trying to gauge what will happen if any such button doesn’t work.
“I’ve heard that some apps and devices aren’t working properly with ‘OKAY’ button, preventing you from getting any message you need,” a Twitter user wrote to Twitter’s bug tracker. “Our thoughts are that “Okay” will still work well in most app stores, but this is a technical issue and we’ll see how quickly we can fix.”
While the OKAY button will still work, it appears that Twitter will roll its way out the feature to other platforms in the future, like Facebook for all of us.
Twitter, of course, previously made its way into messaging with a “sticker” a few years ago that included “OKAY” (the acronym for “Ok”), “SHOKAY” (for “Stop”), and its new arrowed version of the sign up process in the “SHOW” — a combination of the old and new letters of the URL.
“I’ve heard that when using some apps on Google Play, they ask for your username and password, but won’t let you send it unless you’ve already made it clear it’s OKAY,” a user is reporting. “So we have been unable to send some apps on Google Play until now — and sometimes we’ve had to,” he adds.
The company is also testing the “SHOW” button now, too. “We’ve heard some apps have been showing some error messages, suggesting that the SHOW button is no longer supported,” the user explains. “Google is also not a real-time solution – for example, if you’ve opened and closed a Tweet from Twitter and clicked, the app then launched the SHOW button instead,” he notes.

Twitter is testing the gesture, we’ve been told, because it has its own real-event button for a very short period of time — for those of us in a world where we want to share a number of times rather than a single time.
Twitter isn’t the first app to try to bring a way of sharing to the people who haven’t yet been born. Facebook has previously experimented with the “sticker” approach, when it introduced the “Like,” which can share a more permanent way of saying “I’m Feeling Blue” to people.
Here, Twitter makes sense of the problem with “YES” and “NO” for “YES” and “NO” for “NO,” for those of you who are more advanced, but, for simplicity’s sake, we have to point out that we have two times before we throw these words in with our next throw of the test. That’s a problem.
This, I believe, is the first step: get this message out to mobile users. It probably wasn’t the best idea.
If you can help, please reach out.
UPDATE 2: Twitter appears to have corrected the error, as we all now read the results."
"It’s hard enough on the road these days as the Web app landscape continues to grow, but it’s equally frustrating when you want to move fast. It’s even more frustrating, because, while it’s easy to move one app at a time, there are so many alternatives: You can move apps, try to clone one, launch your own app, etc.
In the current app landscape, you may think you’ve found your app. But then you don’t know which one you really need in order to make that happen. There is only one app for managing your life — or at most app store shelves — and that’s where a lot of the apps are currently.
A new app called ‘Life360’ launched today by a well-known startup is called Life360, a simple application designed to move your entire life and make it easier. The app is aimed at people between the ages of 25-39, where the application has you listening to music and movies, and also your TV and TV remote.
The app is launching on Android and iOS today, with a Windows Phone app also in the works.

 Pedro this year, and more specifically the fact that one of the company’s key patents is “unlocking” APIs and functionality from products and services from other developers and devices. It means that the app will not always be able to access Facebook passwords or email passwords, for example, or access Facebook Pages’ and Gmail’s shared passwords to access more broadly.
These are crucial points for Facebook to make at this patent-pending conference and as Facebook continues to push into more and more features of its product, it’s important to make sure that the tools that are important to its business, its potential users and its competitors remain secure. That could mean making sure that “open to the public” and “friends only” don’t get automatically assigned to apps that have become popular over time, for example."
"Google announced a new set of Android 7.0 updates today, and one that goes a step further than most of the new features included in Android 7.1 and 7.1+, like the aforementioned Google Play Experience and the live tiles you see in newer phones for live tiles with access to content like websites and apps. The Live Tiles are new, too, and they’re not just a bunch of widgets that give developers a way to give you access to the operating system on your phone, but a complete new user experience for the general smartphone.
The Live Tile itself is probably a highlight of this update — it’s one of the more unique experiences I’ve seen in a while, thanks to screenshots posted to Google+ by Android fanatics (who are, like me, very cool). It looks good, and features a few technical features that should improve over time, but Google says that the team is still working to add the “real world” to their user experience — i.e. the app will show them what’s available on Google Play for specific categories of apps like games, and Google says that over time the team will enable the “full world” to be introduced to the user experience.
The Live Tile itself is the new take on the Google+-style concept for apps, which have been using the feature as an easy way to share your favorite apps to other users (or at least that’s what it’s made to be), and it’s a nice interface for adding new ones without having to use them or open them yourself.
If you’re wondering why you can’t access Google+ content via the Live Tile, you’re not alone. It’s not as simple as having another set of hoops to jump through to get access (though it is quite easy to do so). You need a special “create account” link that lets you add your social graph and password — the same account that you’ve used to create your Google+ profiles. That password will then let you access Google+ and share links with that account and others. Once you’ve linked your Google+ profile to your Google+ profile and created an account, you’re then able to share to Google+ apps and services like YouTube and Twitter.
When that link is shared, you can either immediately start viewing those apps when you click on the link (Google Play and iTunes are supported), or you can drag and drop one of your apps to the app, as you normally do via the web. Apps can still only be linked with those accounts if they already have enough apps installed on them, however. In that sense, the Live Tile is basically a replacement for the old ways of sharing apps — either by hand-picking what apps to share with (in my case, apps that I find useful or that I use every day, via the Google+ cloud services), or by using the Google+ links to share apps with them.
And the thing is, you still don’t necessarily have to use the Live Tile to share apps with others — you can share to apps like YouTube or Twitter, for example, by simply linking it to the account that you have linked to in your account (which is often your Google+ profile). You can also share to other apps via the app, just like you can currently share apps on your Android smartphone (although it’s a bit more cumbersome and limited to apps that aren’t installed on your smartphone, sadly).
For what it’s worth, the Live Tile itself is pretty simple, but when you think about it, it provides a way to add a few widgets, as well as manage your widgets, and the ability to edit widgets (and edit widgets via drag and drop), with support for touch input and keyboard shortcuts are nice features. It offers shortcuts for things like calling your Gmail, messaging etc. and provides a “create” typeface to let you control what you’re sharing.
I have to admit, I’ve yet to test it

 closed. The service can also support new languages and custom integrations by users so as to avoid fragmentation for its users.
So to simplify the process, Cogit is going to need more of these integrations from third-party developers, which means users will still be able to interact with the team to install the new app. The main question for now will be whether third-party integrations actually become a core use case for Cogit’s users.
The app is available for iPhone, Android, Mac, and Windows."
"While the UK startup scene continues to produce some high-caliber startups, such as Supercell, and other tech-savvy nations like Denmark, the U.K. lacks a European e-commerce startup equivalent.
To that end, a new London-based startup will no doubt sound an oldie-tale welcome, especially when the region has for years been rife with what the British press refer to as the “digital divide”, where big-name e-commerce businesses tend to reside outside of the traditional e-commerce hub. It’s the proverbial digital city vs. the real-world city, and these local analogs are being increasingly ignored by regional e-commerce startups.
Indeed, the real-world city, while local, is being usurped by the digital-me-in’-can as e-commerce businesses migrate to the City — by startups, not by incumbent players. For every Fresh Startup to spring up in the city, a local startup has typically gobbled up the local newspaper chain or supermarket chain.
Now a startup calling Citymapper is thinking through exactly how the Citymapper app ‘navigates’ these analogies and where it’s more cost-effective to build a local e-commerce hub. In a post which will be rolling out over the next few days (it has raised a £1.5 million Series A just in time for next week’), Citymapper argues that the old-school ways to build the old-school infrastructure of e-commerce businesses do not scale anymore, with startups being able to innovate “at a scale to create the kind of product demand for a specific product, and at the quality needed to do so”.
One of the key differentiators between startups in the UK and Europe is the ability to build what the UK’s press refers to as ‘an e-commerce store’ when talking about startups (although, to be fair, many startups in the U.K. are actually tech companies). It’s important to remember that there are no big tech companies headquartered in the UK government or Government Digital Spun Out, and no one in the UK government has announced plans to set up the Digital Economy Agency (a Department of Trade and Investment) to set up a new European digital trading agency (and thus its digital investment arm) (not to mention the EU as a whole). What that new agency will do is set up a “digital spine” between the UK and Europe, which will be the nexus point where commerce is supposed to be sold and done, as part of what it is being built in-house.
And, there’s another big digital infrastructure difference between London and Europe, which is that the Citymapper app and its digital business model will be designed not as a full-blown digital storefront but as a platform where local e-commerce businesses can go to seek customers for their products and create websites to drive them to the city. That’s because the app allows users to link to their online/phone e-commerce storefront on the Citymapper website, which makes the process of creating a local e-commerce store “super simple”.
The app then allows users to search for products within the specified geographic areas they have selected to track and share the information they need on how to connect with the retailer, and then to get them to the local retail store. They are then able to add a description/price/type/condition (e.g. “e-cigarette” if you have a product) and then a photo or video is taken to serve as information to the retailer. For retailers, this is not just an e-commerce option but a social one — where all the local knowledge is being fed directly back to the app’s backend so that they can view reviews and other information on available products to ensure they are buying the best possible bang for their money.
In addition, because the app also allows users to be more than a person online without having to be a business, and to be able to tap into the social graph of the user-generated local knowledge they have, the company has created their own social network to enable people who are active in the local knowledge to be able to tap into the Citymapper community to help others who live in the same area. In other words, while your local knowledge may be offline, you�

 it can do to start seeing more startups, as it moves ahead with its plans to invest more aggressively and strategically into the virtual-reality space. The more people see VR in the mainstream (and the better it performs), the better it gets at advertising and monetization, and the better it is at attracting mainstream users.
As Oculus has shown, these are some interesting questions:
If Oculus is going to be a social network, where people can connect to people they know, and we all agree that Facebook is going to be a huge part, what’s the best social platform for that?
Facebook is already Facebook because of all the social networking services that use a user’s data, like Facebook, Foursquare, Instagram, and Twitter. I’m imagining that Facebook is the “Facebook of VR.” And you might start seeing Facebook VR in the way that Facebook itself is. While that wouldn’t be a perfect, or best, implementation, it could be a big part of what’s going on, and it could also become a big part of what’s going on.
That’s also what Oculus and the Oculus Foundation are now thinking — the way in which games are being played. “That’s going to be an absolutely massive platform in VR. VR is going to be a multi-billion-dollar industry,” David Marcus, CEO of Oculus, said this week on stage at GDC.
There is another reason. It’s also becoming more and more of a commodity. There’s so much we can see going on in VR: From the inside, to the outside, and beyond, that it becomes indistinguishable from any other activity that a consumer sees. The technology could be useful. And, while that’s happening now, there will be new ones in the future.
Oculus and the Rift have gotten a lot of buzz when it comes to the consumer success of these gadgets. It’s clear that the headset market is booming. Google and big developers like Sony, HTC, and Valve have been all trying to sell experiences for the headset, including some very basic consumer-facing experiences:
So what is it about this? Well, at first glance, there seems to be some evidence that the industry is finally ready to see VR. VR is a technology that is now going mainstream. And it’s not just games.
And hey — if you think that way, it’s too early to tell whether this is a reality or not. But let’s say that VR, as an industry, is a reality. What matters now is consumers can see the value in VR and jump in, as they see the benefits, just as they did in the movie business, or for a long time. Of course, I’d wager it’s not just gamers, but everyone who wants to be a part of this revolution. And that’s what this revolution will be about, it’s where the money is at, and where VR has taken to date and could actually be. The rest of us in the world should be watching.
[Correction: There is some evidence that consumers have accepted VR, but we don’t know how many people know about it publicly. And people are likely to be scared, not because they’re excited by the technology, but because the idea — whatever it means — could be scary. The article has been updated to clarify that is the case.]
And I feel like virtual reality. It’s the next frontier in computing technology, and it’s the next obvious computing device. But we don’t know for sure what form we should take as it could transform computing.]
One hundred years ago, we had a very different device. The first computer was a tiny computer running a video camera, and we had no way to interact with a desktop. But we now can. This is a key technological shift, and companies like Oculus are pioneering it."
"It was the most popular and most widely discussed new mobile operating system, Android, at this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. It was also the largest smartphone OS to date. Now, two devices and one smartphone are going to tell whether or not it’s still the best choice for a smartphone. It’s all this and more reasons to stay tuned as Mozilla and its Firefox OS team release a preview of the N1 this Thursday.
It’s quite an announcement. The N1 isn’t a device just yet, but it’s an open, portable platform that’s already available for developers, developers who have a license to build software for your smartphone. That’s because Mozilla is actually the first OEM to take part in the project.
The smartphone is called the N1, because the smartphone itself is not yet a phone — they’re releasing it

 locations, as well as an option to set up recurring rates to be automatically added to your monthly package.
This is the real reason why I went out of my way to give this a try. The idea was intriguing when it first came across my site last year, but the interface was cumbersome. But, for the first time, I was able to find a decent interface.
Now it’s simple enough that I find it difficult to imagine using two different products, but, since it’s easy to get stuck, I tried it out for myself. The product, while pretty basic, was still reasonably priced and in the right size for my needs. I got an item that came in two-packs, so that extra money wasn’t a problem, even if I wanted more, like, an extra set of clothes, or a gift card, with the item still in my bag.

In addition, even though you can pick any size you want, you can only choose from one or two. If you’re going to get everything from two outfits or three, you can always leave it out. But that is easier when you have several outfits you’re going to go into the next day’s gym for.
The company also made it simple to make a recurring order and set up recurring rates. You just have to fill out an application and give it access for you every time you need to fill out your monthly box.

There’s also a nice aspect of this business model, as you can choose how much you want your boxes to cost.
As you can see for myself, the box was easy to use – my box came free, but I chose to include some random stuff and I never go back to buy it. The team explained that you can get free stuff, but if you’re willing to shell out more than $20 each month, you’ll have to work around their pricing plan until they drop it.
When I went to add on items, I usually end up not adding them. But it’s hard, as expected, to not want them, and there’s plenty to choose from.
Of course, it’s worth pointing out that you can always turn to Amazon. But there are some nuances to the market, and, even if you’re unfamiliar with the company, Amazon is perfect for this sort of service and, of course, it’s always good at shipping packages.
But in fact, it seems this new service is not all that complicated enough. As it seems, this market might be a little tougher than you might think when it comes to dealing with multiple boxes of stuff.
According to the team, most of the clients who make a monthly box subscription seem to like it, and that was a key point in my own experience. I added that to myself because, again, my boxes included stuff I really wanted for several different days of the week.
On a larger scale, BoxBuddy makes sense because boxes are often the first thing you do when planning a big party. You might go out to a bar for one, and then go out to a club for the second, and then go out to a venue with a bunch of things, and then bring them all back the third. Maybe they got you a bunch of those things you love. Maybe they even got you all of them.
Again, boxes are often the first thing you do.
And here’s where BoxBuddy gets into the mix.
The service lets you automatically add items to your box every month, and the service also helps you turn your box into a shared box of stuff.
While BoxBuddy is an example of a box-box service, it’s actually kind of like a box for things you care about. Because the box is personalized for you, you can choose to have items on the first day, the  second day, the third day, and so on. You can also get a box of boxes on the same date.
But the company’s value proposition is something beyond the product. I imagine BoxBuddy being great for those of you who are like the folks who go to thrift shops, but like to regularly go out shopping, and then find a nice package you want for their stuff. That’s more relevant to BoxBuddy, and it makes more sense given that the company will give you a subscription box, too, if you go through the BoxBuddy website.
One caveat: BoxBuddy requires you to install an app for your boxes to even open. That said, a lot of these boxes are actually going out to people – the service works in real time when you need to respond to a call. If you don’t have time to set up recurring boxes, there’s a decent chance BoxBuddy isn’t going to work

�s CEO of mobile analytics company MobileAnalytics.com, in fact, which is not one of the larger mobile ad platforms, is also a key partner here.
If the company is a hit, it could become a big step up for the company — especially if the user base is not entirely there yet. The goal is for the company’s data to be useful to marketers, not just for the platform makers’ sake.
“We are going to be a really powerful marketing tool,” Vysk Chief Revenue Officer Adam Miron said. Vysk is also rolling out some other cool stuff, too, including new mobile apps based on its brand names, including Ebola.
While the deal makes sense for the company itself, Vysk is also doing something else — it is becoming one of the biggest ad technology companies in the world with its size. This is also a big step up. The company has already raised $8 million in funding.
On the other hand as well. There are other big names joining in the ad tech world. For example, Vyte, a video ad engine that helps marketers reach users through Facebook and Twitter, is now a member of adtech startup adtech business unit AdColony.
“Vysk is at the intersection of social and mobile,” Vysk CEO and co-founder Hans Wiebe (who comes from Vysk) said in a statement. “By being on a social network and a social network ad network that’s monetizing,” he had to be careful to say it, “we’ll give our users an ad platform that’s both powerful and powerful.” He called this a big leap forward on Facebook for people.
The company is now active in 40 countries. For the most part, the business is about to get even more powerful. While they don’t disclose figures, they say that the business has grown at a rate of 20 percent month on month and that it’s now “one of the fastest ever for a mobile advertising business.”
“When we started out, our vision was that advertising would be a big part of the mobile ad stack and that would play well and people would use this as a medium,” Wiebe said.
“The beauty of it is the fact that it’s monetization and if you’re just ad-funded by social, you're going to have a huge amount of eyeballs, but if you’re able to monetize on mobile, if you have a compelling enough product, you might as well be advertising,” he said as part of a panel discussion at the Bloomberg media conference. With the extra firepower, you could see how they could extend their ad technology even further for mobile — Wiebe said they already have plans to extend their mobile ad tech, but he wasn’t revealing who else might be using the platform. The question will be whether the social media company will find other ways of delivering revenue, Wiebe said."
"The new MacBook is out today and I was fortunate enough to have been given one myself. It’s a beautiful but powerful little thing to behold and I have to confess, I fell in love with it immediately. With the new 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro with Retina Display and the new Apple Pencil technology, you can do a lot of things with the technology that I already love about my MacBook, but they really go beyond what you would be able to do with any kind of stylus.
The main thing is that the MacBook is truly a new, modern, MacBook. It’s thinner, thinner than previous models, and there are even more ports. There are even more ports in the back. The new Intel Haswell chip is a great foundation for this, and it really does get better as you use it, allowing you to use it with more software applications like Photoshop, creating digital arts in software or using it with the pen at a hardware level.
The display is beautiful and crisp, especially with the larger screen. It has a real estate that’s true as I can say — the space is almost all real estate right now, so you really don’t need to do anything else. It’s clear that the new MacBook has done a lot of work to create this, and honestly, I think they have indeed.
And it works.

As we saw with the Surface 2 and the Apple Watch, there are new MacBook technologies coming in each generation, but that doesn’t mean I don’t have more to go with. It actually is a bit much, but if I need all of the latest applications, including the new MacBook, I still have room to do it with Microsoft Office and Apple’s productivity tools and productivity tools.

 money. You have to go to another retailer to purchase the stuff you see, and then you have to get the cash. Most banks, in contrast, have a more direct relationship with people — and, of course, if you don’t like a card on someone else’s mobile device, they have a direct relationship with you.
There’s still a lot of uncertainty in the payments space, but it appears the key is to be a leader in the space and a pioneer that offers a way of processing on-the-go.
So far, so Good; here’s what we can expect from the service under new management."
"While the Internet is still in its early phases, the Internet is already having a real impact on the way that businesses communicate. There are new types of marketing tools available for businesses to communicate with their customers via the Internet, whether it’s a big brick and mortar store or a e-commerce store. But, while all of this communication is good for consumers, most efforts have been aimed at helping restaurants manage that communication across any and all channels. At the same time, the same questions keep coming up, which leads to this current focus on hospitality, which is why YPlan decided to invest in YPlan’s mobile payment platform. 
Today, YPlan is launching a new service called Groom, which provides a platform where businesses can connect the two worlds — the customers, and the guests. With this new tool, the idea is to provide the same level of consumer-facing online customer support, so that guests can reach out to the business to report problems and get help from the guests. These guests, on the other hand, aren’t the ones having to contact the business directly. They’re also not the ones who’s going to give the guest some guidance, either. Instead, every interaction is done on the Web with the guests in the background.
This is true of many products now on the market, and, while online and on-demand solutions are seeing rapid growth across the board, the same could be said for mobile payments. In the case of any restaurant, a customer doesn’t need to contact, text, call or schedule a call with the restaurant — in fact, they can use Groom to manage the entire customer experience for the hospitality. 
Starting with the fast-growing restaurants, a restaurant could use Groom to monitor guest behavior, like where the guest is and how long they stay and, without ever looking directly at a restaurant, the guests could get the most out of their experience using the service. 
The real problem, however, is that when people are in restaurants, they want to stay. That’s a huge differentiator, as most hotels today require guests to have a hotel stay until they’re 25 or 21. Even though there’s little bit of competition with startups like EasyStay, YPlan thinks it’s just beginning to scratch the itch of this millennial segment.
In turn, the fast-growing hospitality industries aren’t exactly about guest satisfaction. Many of their guest-facing apps and technology focus on guest experience, not guests. While, on the other hand, companies like OpenTable are taking pains with a guest experience that emphasizes the guest experience — whether by offering an interactive map for guests, interactive media during the stay (like virtual reality or live stream), or a mobile-friendly way of checking-in and checking out.
While it’s unclear how the service will differentiate from those platforms and the difference it will bring to the field overall, Groom is taking a different approach. Essentially, the service is looking for the guests themselves to benefit, and, for the guests to use. By offering a platform that enables restaurants to take a snapshot of their guests, it gives guests a way to do just that, while also showing the guests the best possible experience for their money.
To do this, the platform provides a way for guest and guests to connect, as the host brings out their guest-facing website, mobile app, social channels and so on. The host gets granular information about the guest, what they’re looking for, where they’re located and how many guests want to visit. 
The hosts are connected through a wealth of data, as the hosts can compare prices, specials, specials, locations and so on — to do all this, the guests can’t even see the restaurant’s content, it’s all there in the cloud. 
But what’s even more unique about the product is that, while it’s still early for this to be a true game, the Groom team is already seeing strong adoption amongst their first customers; both in terms of retention and growth. The founders, Steve Johnson and Jason Zucker, are already seeing strong growth on mobile, which is definitely having an impact on their company’s bottom line,

 in its home country, with the service now available in eight cities in the US. And while Facebook is not announcing the number of towns and cities covered today, we understand this is in a number of cities across China — “many”, we have been told, are areas with a population of around 200,000 people.
Facebook says it will be working with local authorities in its various towns to allow users to use this service, with that process happening via Facebook. There is also likely a mobile version coming soon, as Facebook has also been testing the service in India, where people have been posting content on Facebook posts to get their friends to download the app. On the other hand, we are talking to sources close to Facebook to get a sense of how these moves may go.
The news comes at a time when Facebook is facing another significant challenge: convincing third parties that it is indeed a social network, and that this will only be a part of the experience. The company continues to keep its own site — called Timeline — as a separate entity that the vast majority of people in the world don’t actually use.
While Timeline has seen many other changes in the past year, this move to roll out the service across more countries, including the roll out in Germany, comes at a time when Facebook may be facing even greater pressure as a result. Last month, Facebook told the German Federal Social Service Commission it would be rolling out Timeline on Google+ and Facebook pages beginning this year, and the first step was to sign up the data source for the roll out.
We have sources also close to Facebook to understand how these moves have been going down, including information from sources close to each Facebook representative, as well as a source at the company confirming to us that indeed Facebook is rolling out Timeline today in Germany — that timeline is being presented with as an individual timeline in the German domain, one that does include the launch of the service in Germany.
There, the timeline will present the same citation-based layout, but without the profile info around the individual user.
The German roll-out is a “small percentage” of that rollout to the US, Facebook tells us.
We have confirmed this rollout, as well as the timeline information, via Facebook, and we are awaiting a response from Facebook to the question whether it has made the right decision. We are also waiting for an official confirmation from Facebook on this matter. We’ll update if we hear back. Update: Facebook has responded to our question saying: “We are rolling out Timeline on Google+ and adding Facebook to the top of the page in Germany, with our Facebook page on the top of the page in Germany,” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
When asked whether Facebook has a timeline in Germany — where Timeline is already being rolled out — Facebook told us “Yes, we have a curated timeline for individual users in Germany as this is a smaller percentage of who we have rolled out the way Facebook is rolled out on the web.”
When asked specifically if this could be Facebook rolling out Timeline to the US as a standalone service, Facebook didn’t answer us. “The timing for it is something we are determining,” a source said. “With Timeline coming in Germany, and Timeline coming in the US, we need to roll out these timelines on both the desktop and mobile, so we have an idea on when it will be rolled out.”
“We also have a few other timelines and smaller bits in beta. We’re rolling out these as separate accounts, so people don’t have their Timeline on both Facebook and Twitter,” added a third source.
Facebook, of course, has a huge opportunity to do as much as possible to spread the advertising reach of its service to a larger audience.
If this rollout goes as it planned — for example, in Germany — it’s likely that Facebook would turn to advertising for generating ad revenues, and if it were to decide to monetize its service as it does — that could also involve monetizing by selling user data.
For now, Facebook has pulled all Timeline ads onto all users’ mobile devices, except for the user who added the Timeline ad to their timeline. In all other user’s regions where Facebook is present users can still scroll past.
Another part of the rollout in Germany could involve users being able to upload a photo by using the web for photo sharing elsewhere to their Facebook friends — which could be a business-based opportunity.

However, the Facebook timeline doesn’t allow pictures of the Facebook Timeline to be uploaded at the scale of one individual to the total number of Timeline users — so a whole group of people need to get their Facebook Timeline to a certain date in

raised which he says will be used, by the way, to expand the device, with more storage and storage options coming soon, with plans to offer custom hardware options down the road. And then, of course, to start selling and shipping its device next spring. As for competing with the likes of the Samsung Galaxy and Nexus line… Well, Google’s up to that.
Meanwhile, Apple has been quietly expanding its own tablet business, including the iWatch and, more recently, the iPhone, and more recently the Apple Watch — and, of course, it recently launched the rumored Macbook — as well as a tablet of tablets.
And of course there are still issues with those tablets, of course, not least of which the touchscreen is often criticized for still requiring a user to bend their device to be readable. (That’s certainly one reason why some people have taken to calling tablets on-shelves instead of wristphones.)
As well as Google trying to sensivate the Android user base held captive by the dominance of its Google Play platform, in an attempt to expand the reach of its own services — and by extension its advertising and monetization efforts — others have tried to create their own ecosystem in-home, by building smartphone-like interfaces on hardware manufacturers’ suppliers. The Samsung SmartWatch, a close second hand to Google’s, is among such efforts at the moment. Or, in the other case, Apple recently released the iWatch, another smartwatch option designed to bridge the digital and physical worlds, in collaboration with a local electronics manufacturer in Cupertino.
It is also apparently targeting a new category of mobile that it calls “wearables,” which has so far been undefined.
Another example of another attention-grabbing Android competitor to watch in the form iZettle was in the shape of Square’s cardless wristband, which lets sneakers charge for their transactions only when they have an incoming card. Hence its less eye-catching title — but it is not far from a rival in this space of Google-owned Android: rather, with the sheer volume of data it processes via its devices and apps running on its service, it gives it the potential to compete with all the many players aiming to replace credit-based payments with a user-driven, location-based business model.
So there we stand now. Six players, all trying to tackle the same market  — and trying to leverage their own respective strengths and not necessarily their own. Or attempting to be so nameless that they can’t be differentiated. (So that’s no way.)
Here’s the full run-down of the companies:
Mountain View-based SumUp – with a U.S. roll-out expected “in the next 12 months”. Ludlow-based Bebl.com – with a U.K. roll-out expected in the next 12 months.
London-based MobileSyrup — with a U.S. roll out expected “in the next 2 months”. London-based MobileTribes — with a U.S. roll out expected in the next 2 months. MobileTribes is backed by Mountain View-based Founder Eric Schmidt."
"It’s another case of a European startup facing competition from established U.S. players in the e-commerce space. Last week, it was the case of Fabrice Grinda, founder of OpenFeint, the Berlin-based in-app mobile ad network, who is now based in the U.S. to expand to the U.S. market as well as continue to invest and develop the business on Fabrice’s home turf.
Founded by Grinda and his friend and business partner Tom Jansen, now both execs at Amazon Web Services (one of the companies that Grinda used to run) Grinda took initial investment in Facebook, and later moved to Google after being a co-founder and CEO of the social network. He is now also a founding member of the Startup Institute co-working space Startup Weekend.
On that note, Grinda has been actively investing and developing the technology that underpins Facebook, the other big online commerce deal we’ve covered in the past year that also has a European co-founder. 
While Grinda isn’t a stranger to the European startup scene, he was actually living in Belgium when we contacted him about moving to Silicon Valley. What he found was, however, was that there was not yet a Silicon Valley-based accelerator that could meet the needs of entrepreneurs and fledgling companies in the EU.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Uber-branded phone is a very big focus going forward as a part of Google’s Android platform. This new device is, as we wrote earlier today, an Android-based smartphone that looks more like its iOS counterpart.
It’s not clear just how much it will cost, or what that price point will be. Google is targeting a price point that’s within a range that’s affordable enough to be available for both developing on its phone platform and to a more mainstream consumer audience. That was reiterated today as Google’s VP Android Dave Burke confirmed on the phone’s launch that it will be cheaper than Blackberry — with a version of Android running on both 2.3 and SAP’s new open MobileData standard, the same version of the platform that’s used on Apple iPhones.
On the subject of a future update to Google's operating system — in this case to let the customer choose between the devices that they buy, as many have argued it will with Blackberry’s demise — Google has made some other comments on the matter today: namely that it will “be very different” from the Android Jelly Bean software available as part of the software update, although this will probably be at least partially a pre-release program, a la the early interest with partners in the Android ecosystem.
Google also hinted that if customers choose to continue with the software update their devices will also work with the software update, which allows for more customization options.
The Blackphone 2 and Blackphone 2 Pro both offer a lot in terms of personalization, but both use a mix of hardware and software to offer differentiates between them. Blackphone 2, for example, is the first devices I’ve tested to support these changes, and both offer the ability for users to customize the software on their device further by giving them access to Google Wallet functionality.
Blackphone 2 is $199, depending on your carrier and whether you pay in Umm, or with a card. These new phones both let users customize the software, since it’s the first publicly available update of Android to the device. Blackphone 2 is priced as the first phone in the lineup, so it will be interesting to see what type of pricing and price point they choose as the first device to join them in offering both personalization options and an in-car customization option for those who choose that option.
The Moto G, meanwhile, took up a tough fight for those who have expressed interest in such a device. With its 4G LTE processor, it’s still a little early to say whether, either via a high-profile OEM support campaign, the Moto G’s first hardware is likely to make it to the consumer market. So the market will continue to be competitive but also there are some different approaches this year. I suspect there’s still lots of room for innovation in this smartphone market.
Google may also be able to offer a different mobile experience when it comes to what it means to use mobile data in a mobile device in general. With this, the phone becomes a more ‘smartphone’ in many senses (no pun intended), even if it’s just a few features or a relatively low-cost device that’s not necessarily going to change any consumer behavior in the end."
"If you’re a developer today, you know that the app landscape is a crowded place where the new entrants have ample room to make in-app improvements. Apple has some new updates to its App Store today that add features to help the general consumer experience, with some more notable developments including a much-improved search engine and improved navigation, but overall, a significant improvement in the developer experience on the platform.
This is Apple’s latest move designed, in large part, to help developers who don’t have a great experience with the native app. These updates will enable the developer to take advantage of iOS 7’s first major feature.
First there’s a brand new Search engine which should make life easier for consumers. Search, in all its infancy, has always been tricky. It’s the nature of the feature that makes it so tricky, and the inherent nature of the user interface that makes the interface so challenging that native developers have been struggling to make the right trade-off. By making Search, like so many other features in iOS, available in the App Store and on the web, Apple intends to change that, letting all potential apps gain a competitive advantage. And, in turn, the startup ecosystem that comes with App Store search, or “app stores” in other places, can be much more robust than ever before.

For example, the iOS 7 home screen now offers access to a new navigation panel that includes things like Favoriting and Recommendations, in addition to categories like Apps. If the user

 The $1 million will be paid directly to an accredited public corporation, according to a press release. This will include expenses for this year’s finals, according to the company’s latest earnings call.
The firm is only managing $150,000 in advance from these funds so clearly they are not making much profit. They are also not investing at this point but the firm is a bit worried by the amount of money they’re keeping for this round of investments.
They are taking a few at this point with a little bit of margin and a little bit of a mix of investments. The final amount will be settled later this summer.
“When you start to do things like this, you tend to overshoot,” the firm added.
In recent years the firm has invested in 15 companies across the world, according to Crunchbase data.
As well as this investment, it has also recently invested as a hedge fund in Zoopla, a data discovery platform from Y Combinator — the YC that has come under scrutiny in a 2014 report.
The firm has raised a total of $1.65 million to date and has become an early player in Silicon Valley’s Silicon Valley.
It has also invested in data-centric startups like Uber, Box.com and SoundCloud.
This latest seed investment comes at a pivotal moment for the firm, which was founded by serial entrepreneur Nick Tholler who served as their chief technology officer.
“The timing was perfect,” said Tholler who worked on the same product for the next 6 years. “I was working on my first product and Nick was building the core architecture of the new product. And the one that really struck me was that we really were able to execute that core architecture and really execute the core core of the product.”
As for why the firm decided to make this second investing rather than the first? They felt it was “a great fit and will allow [the company] to stay stake in our success,” said Tholler.
“We feel like this is an investment where we can put in the time,” he said."
"Twitter rolled out a new version of its iOS and Android apps today and introduced one more major feature — Twitter Audience Network. It means Twitter will help brands, advertisers and publishers target their campaigns to other Twitter users when you have over 24 hours to spare.
The new social ad hoc network is called a retargeted retarget, and it lets you target people across either one of the three retargeted networks or the retargeted ads network that will be used by Twitter for ads.
Once you’ve identified potential customers across these retargeted networks, there’s a lot more to the company’s strategy with these ads, and a more powerful tool at its disposal to drive more sales.
The goal here is to give marketers more confidence in the return on investment that it’s likely they’ll be able to achieve by buying their ads across these retargeted retargeted networks. It might also allow brands to target audiences across these retargeted ad hoc networks, so that they can more effectively spend on retargeted ad campaigns and deliver users to their other target markets.
One way to think of Twitter Audience Network is a click-through rate — so you’re more likely to click through to your site and download apps if you’re seeing a promoted tweet that makes it easy to click for a good duration of time.
And if you think about it, users are willing to click through to a web page so that you can go to your site and see ads. So it seems like a smart way to optimize the ad targeting of retargeted users.
Of course, this still doesn’t solve Twitter’s actual problem of scaling its advertising business. When you’re retargeted, you’re going to spend more time on the web page, and to make Twitter’s goal as simple and transparent as possible, you have to make changes where you see your reach. So it’s not an easy task to target customers across various retargeted networks and retargeted ads."
"While the number of startups across the U.K.’s startup scene is set to spike this year over 2015, a U.K. tech startup is moving for the bigger stages. This morning an unidentified Startup First accelerator program will launch in East London, to fund the next generation of global tech startups.

The company says it plans to update the software and updates the site as soon as it’s available."
"Today Facebook has launched ads from the News Feed that are targeted at the top of the feed’s article scrolling stream. The ads appear on the top of your feed for a little longer than the ads themselves. The ad formats include Sponsored Stories that show up at the bottom of the feed.
Facebook is currently testing these Sponsored Stories, though it was not able to say which one until now. Sponsored Stories, as well as Sponsored Stories ads, have been available in the feed since October 2013. Sponsored Stories are ads that advertisers are paying for that appear when you scroll past an advertiser’s content in the feed.
They can come from Facebook’s ads product or news reader plugins. Facebook has been moving to a new editorial direction in advertising, with news feed Sponsored Stories and Sponsored Stories ads becoming popular, with Sponsored Stories and Sponsored Stories ads on their News Feed.
Facebook’s Sponsored Stories Ads can be seen on the right side of the ad, though they appear less prominently on the right of the ad.
Sponsored Stories are similar to Sponsored Stories ads on the right side of the feed, with the Sponsored Stories version replacing Sponsored Stories on the bottom of the feed, the News Feed said. Sponsored Stories ads appear automatically based on text and image matching your search. They do not generate other clicks as Sponsored Stories ads do. Sponsored Stories ads will only appear to people who click ads directly from publishers’ content, like their Facebook app.
A Sponsored Stories ad for an apparel company ran by an NPR news affiliate showed Sponsored Stories ads in the feed, and in the feed, the Sponsored Stories ad was topically replaced by Sponsored Stories ads from the ad of the sponsor (NPR).
In addition, Sponsored Stories ads work similar to Sponsored Stories ads — users will only see Sponsored Stories by advertisers who have sponsored Facebook pages. Sponsored Stories ads are the advertisers’ preferred ad formats, Facebook says."
"Mark Zuckerberg has weighed in on the controversial surveillance debate — the Internet and communications as a communications medium — while a group of tech CEOs and others today called for a “national conversation.” “This is the way forward. We need to get to the bottom of what’s happening in terms of what we should do about privacy,” he was quoted as saying today at a town hall gathering in Silicon Valley.
What is he doing, as you will see below in a follow-up story by our own Josh Constine, which will give a fuller understanding of Zuck’s views to what is driving the call for an examination, and the calls they want answered at next.
“This is a conversation that’s happening right now, but we need to get to the bottom of whether we will be able to solve it and create a solution to this issue,” said Zuckerberg, speaking to the crowd, which included not only some of the country’s biggest tech companies, but also people from across the technology industry, including Bill Gates’ Foundation as well as VCs and others.
Zuck, whose Facebook portfolio includes companies like PayPal and the Huffington Post that he invested in, and other investments into the platform, didn’t take the stage.
A report out this week that Facebook’s shares had fallen by more than 50 percent in trading sparked the company’s shares to spring back to the $38 a share price. It’s one of the bigger tech IPO timing this year — for a reason — and is probably best of all for investors. The IPO is Facebook’s most public-looking one, where the company will be looking for bigger markets to set its valuation higher.
A little market-timing here: Facebook’s share price today was at $38.75, at just over $40 less than the $38.65 share price that it started trading at a day earlier. The average public offering price for stock or other public equities, as well as a public S&P 500, start at about $38.10 a share.
Zuck has talked about how Facebook is becoming more public: before today, Facebook had just 1 billion users, around 2 billion monthly active users, and $1.9 billion in revenue. Now it’s expanding to 1.05 billion users. And on revenues: “We are very interested in the earnings report,” he said.
Zuckerberg has been a big presence on tech news this year, but not necessarily during the talk

 heavy, especially if you’re an iOS developer.
The iOS app and Android app let users post questions on top of a live chat and ask questions that might or might not affect their lives, but while iOS has a good feature, it’s confusing to see such an app take over a chat. You had to sign up with Facebook to participate, which was a hassle.
Zuck explained that ZuckerBOT was designed to be lightweight and “completely customizable.” He likened the software to a “Pandora app” in which users could post questions, find answers, and then reply with details and questions. For example, I could ask him who was the best guitarist of the song My Crazy Angel, and if I had the answer and to what degree I was playing it correctly.
Zuck said he came to the conclusion that people didn’t want to be “showing off” or “having fun” with chat, because they want results.
ZuckerBOT’s launch follows a new app called Foursquare that lets users check in and discover who nearby stores and restaurants are open at any given time. The focus: Foursquare, by contrast, focuses most of its focus on price-based searches.
The updated Zuck app is a free download here. You can try ZuckCodes on iPhone here, or hit up Zuck on the web here. The Android app is not yet available."
"We covered SnapChat’s big partnership with Facebook yesterday, as well as its big redesign (and a few other big newsworthy features). So now Snapchat is moving upmarket by pitching all of its own features in the Snapchat app as free for users to see.
Snapchat recently launched a major update of the app for Android that will allow users to view both public and private photos and videos in a single app. So now users can send them snaps to every other Snapchat user. For instance, you might send a few snaps of a new tattoo, a group of snaps of a group of birthdays, an interesting video of the day, a cute cat picture, or a special emoji.
That way you can easily show Snapchat the snaps it needs to see.
“Snapchat has really evolved into becoming this place that’s you live, it’s your picture, it’s your voice, it’s an amazing medium that’s really hot,” Snapchat Product Marketing Director Brandon McCormick said in an interview.
Now, you can show a Snap to any Snapchatter with a simple tap.
The SnapChat team has been hard at work on the feature for two years now.
It’s easy to see how this makes Snapchat’s feature set and overall app feel fresh. And while there have been reports where users have started sending SnapChat photos to friends — to their co-workers, maybe, or even their ex-boyfriends — that’s gone quickly.
That might have been an advantage that Snapchat had over rival apps like Instagram — which recently had to deal with another embarrassing scandal thanks to a nude selfie user, prompting its owner to take the action of banning nude pics on its service. (Though some say this is a big mistake for SnapChat in terms of not going after the whole nude selfie thing.)
Snapchat’s CEO Evan Spiegel said that the company will be making a big push toward making it easier to send Snapchats (which it does not use) to friends.
“What we’re looking at is making Snapchats as easy. We see the use cases for Snapchats like movie trailers, or TV shows… That is how we see value,” McCormick said. “You would send a Snapchat to your buddies and we do want to make the experience for our users as good as possible.”
Indeed, the idea of a new feature like this does seem more transparent to users. There’s clearly been a lot of discussion about it, even when Snapchat was still working on a huge visual redesign last year. For Snapchat to take Snapchats as an added way to send to friend users is clearly going to involve some hiding of Snapchats.
This will be an important way to try out Snapchat’s different features, as they could provide a big draw for users who might previously have shied away.
As the company says, Snapchats have always been a big part of the company’s visual messaging service. They are a popular way to send photos back or forth to each other, too. But those photos were not always always as simple as Snapchat photos, which is certainly not to say that Snapchat will be moving away from more ‘

’s a major setback for the company, which went public last September. The deal will close in March.
Sikka says the news is “somber” and not “newsy”. There were the rumors of its impending launch; its CEO’s comments disparaging its rival Facebook as a product for children; its failure to generate a huge new community for its app; and its $1-million-plus CrunchBase hit.
While Facebook is trying to position itself as a platform provider, the app itself has begun to emerge more as a destination for casual social networking. When users switch from one social network to another, they don’t go back to using one service or another, but continue to use Facebook for a more focused function. (It’s similar to how Apple is positioning its iOS product, for instance.) Meanwhile, apps like Path, as well as more casual apps like Snapchat, have begun targeting consumers who aren’t necessarily using them for other reasons.

Sikka says the app’s long-term impact will depend on whether people want to use Facebook or a second service. And if they do, Facebook’s platform can become the new “default social networking platform.” He also notes that while this may impact app’s longer-term growth, at least for now, the concern over a Facebook platform’s long-term future will go away.
“We have built incredible experiences for millions of people,” he says in the statement. “Now we’re going to create the long-term platform that’s going to make people’s lives better! That balance can’t be balanced by Facebook’s success.”"
"Facebook has taken one more stab at video after testing Live videos last month, but at the last push it seems to have thrown the mic in the corner and gone back to the drawing board. The app has made some tweaks to the video experience, and has even gone down in a new way as a stream.
As it stands, Facebook’s Video app streams a video to an unlimited number of friends at once. That means that when a friend watches a video, Facebook’s mobile web app, with the update rolling out today, will now auto-back up video in real-time. This works alongside the fact that Facebook’s own streaming video app now has a dedicated section for watching videos.
As before the app’s name, Live Videos will only show up within your Facebook profile if you’re logged in and have the Facebook app installed. It will also now be automatic “hidden” videos within your profile after they’ve been watched. But that’s not to downplay the fact that the app’s name is a direct connection to Live’s live shows — something co-founder Periscope’s been touting for a fair amount of time.
The app’s real name change is more of a test of Messenger’s waters, according to Viral Viral’s Evan Long. Apparently Messenger and its new video features seem to have been in the works for sometime, even though the app’s name was only introduced last month.
This could indicate that the company is aware of the vocal concern that “Instagram for Video” might have generated and is now testing the waters of video messaging to see if Messenger and video are as much of a hit with the community. Facebook’s not the only one to go after video messaging apps, of course, as it turns out.
It’s important to note that this won’t happen for Facebook-only videos or Facebook-only live events. Since Facebook-only users tend to overshare and upload content to other platforms, it’s clear that a feature like Instant, which is meant for users to consume and share within the group, would benefit Facebook-only as much once more. Still, it’s notable that the app that came out of Play for sharing videos would only work via Messenger if you were logged-in and had the app installed. Otherwise, you’d need to switch to video."
"On-demand rides services like Uber and its ilk make it easy for individuals and businesses to get pick-up at a local store when they’re in need. However, if you travel for a recreational bike ride, there’s little chance of you ever seeing someone ride a bike because they were in the same spot as you. The problem is, there isn’t much you know about the riders.

 fashion you’re actually spending, not some other apps like Instagram and Flurry. If you spend, and your friends are feeling it too, or you’re getting bored, then these services will eventually let you know.
There are some other challenges, though, too. To cut off a lot of information, I don’t think this will help Facebook get much more specific and close the loop around who you’re and what is important. I’d imagine, however, that Facebook will also want to cut off content so the user doesn’t end up getting more info.
I do believe the Facebook News Feed could become a big part of a person’s lives, though. It’s probably too similar to Twitter to be accurate.
The problem may be that Facebook already has the best news feed. The algorithm was created by its friends."
"Facebook had at stake for years as it tried to get other businesses to install its ads program. Now it may now reap a bigger advantage on the business side, thanks to acquisitions made by it in 2014 and 2015, according to a company spokesperson who spoke to the Wall Street Journal. In one recent deal to boost it to more ad revenues, Facebook scooped up Lynda.com and AdwordsUp.
Lynda.com, you might recall, is a big business education company that offers courseware and learning resources for learning and career skill development, which it acquired in 2012 to build out its student engagement and networking platform Acquia. The startup had been looking for a buyer — other than its previous acquireon, AdAge suggested — and a search made with the help of Facebook found them at the top of the pile.
In what is likely an interesting buyback for Lynda.com, the acquisition actually could get Facebook looking a little more deeply in the student space, and especially the digital workforce education.

Acquia is the maker of a platform for managing data acquisition and analysis for academic and industry organizations — a cloud-based solution that can be customized to fit into the needs and financial requirements of specific schools and districts.

The acquisition was one of the biggest for Facebook.
Acquia is owned by private equity firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and valued at $13 billion on the back of the $2.45 billion it was valued at the same day when it was acquired by Kleiner and Acquia, plus $3.4 billion in cash and stock. Kleiner’s involvement in the company was predicated on the fact that the two would be aligned going forward, so the entire deal — and yes, it was a cash in hand — looked like more like acquisitions than a buyout.
Acquia co-founder and CEO Adam Goldenberg says in the WSJ that Facebook was impressed about Acquia because it fits so well on the acquisition-front.
“Lynda’s proven to be a super-valued company. That’s a very good fit for Facebook,” he said.
Acquia isn’t saying who’s going to be using it or where, specifically: the WSJ says that Acquia CEO Raj Patel will work on the product and “become a member of Facebook’s advisory board.”
It makes sense that this would be coming from a company like Acquia, which is on track to IPO someday. While other strategy-focused acquisitions in the past year (most notable, maybe, being purchased by Salesforce for under $200 million) have more or less been about improving the product rather than acquiring people in the organization that’s actually building it.
Acquia’s team has been around since its earliest days: it had started as an undergraduate college summer school project back in 2000. It became Acquia after studying at Stanford. Like Lynda.com, Acquia was founded and run by two men: Bradley Horowitz, a former Stanford undergraduate and partner, who worked at a venture capital firm in the mid-1990s when a big Silicon Valley hit had a hit on the scene; and David Watson, who had at least a decade with big tech companies in the late 80s and 90s, a time when Facebook was around its heyday.
Acquia launched in 1994 to make a difference with a mobile ad network targeting the college audience and then it took off as a real business after doing business with colleges.
It then morphed into a subscription business, which it had an initial revenue share to in some cases of education, too. It then also started a platform for colleges to build out their own advertising businesses, including a suite of analytics to see how popular content and students are performing, with that business reportedly worth $30 billion to the college

 The feature itself was developed with a different goal: making it a lot easier to see a live concert, and that’s definitely the case for this new app.

"This week on the TC Gadgets Podcast, John Biggs, Darrell Etherington and Matt Burns discuss the latest in the world of CES, and how that relates to the new products presented at the 2017 TechCrunch Disrupt conference.
In a small studio in Los Angeles, Steve Jobs once said that the future was “about technology.” There was not a better representation of this than the way Samsung recently presented its latest iteration of the Galaxy and Apple simultaneously unveiled its new iPhone 7.
We discuss all this and more on this week’s episode of TC Gadgets as well as live on Periscope, in-app broadcasts in both English and Spanish, and finally discuss all the latest from Google News with Jeff Jordan over at the TC Gadgets Podcast!
We invite you to enjoy weekly Android podcasts every Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. Eastern and 1:30 p.m. Pacific, in addition to our weekly TC Gadgets podcast at 3 p.m. Eastern and noon Pacific on Fridays. Subscribe to the TechCrunch Droidcast in iTunes, too, if that’s your fancy.

"Samsung is looking to the future as a theme for its new $2-billion-plus acquisition of LG, the Korea-based smartphone maker that has also put up some impressive new technology and its first big smartphone, the LG G6, this afternoon in Barcelona.
At first glance the G6 looks almost too obvious: it’s a phone that looks almost too much like an Android phone, with a glass crown and an attractive metal edge. The G6 is in the mid to low range, but Samsung is touting a new flagship smartphone for both the mid and low end of the market, along with the same rounded corners. In fact, LG has positioned its phone as a “smartphone in the pocket” — something that other mobile makers including Huawei and ZTE are as well, but that Samsung is really hoping to change that when it comes to its smartphone lineups.
The LG G6’s big hardware addition, besides the hardware hardware, is a dual-sensor sensor front-facing camera, which enables a new “sensor enhanced VR gaming” interface, as Samsung’s Director of Product Partnerships for South Korea, Ahang Joo, calls it.
While VR gaming is a topic that Samsung has been working on for its mobile products, the big question is just how quickly and how well these things are going to arrive. The LG G5, for instance, uses a slightly larger sensor on the back of the device — with the sensor protruding outward, and actually requiring users to bend their head in order to turn back and out on their VR headset.

That is to say, Samsung’s VR headset has not been designed around a new kind of head movements for a smartphone that is used to manipulate the way that it moves a bit using the Oculus Rift or other virtual reality technology — like a phone’s glass-capping gesture.
Instead, Samsung has brought that tech to the VR gaming itself. The headset can use sensors in motion as a “body sensing platform,” according to the company’s says SVP for Engineering, Craig Ma. “You can use any body movements, no matter where they are on your body, to move the camera down and the laser down, that’s all you have to make it.”

The company also plans to be introducing a new type of head movement into its new Gear VR headset – something that it also mentioned last week at its news event.
Samsung’s headset is, in any case, one of two. A headset like the Oculus Rift is based around the use of head movement sensing.
Meanwhile, the company’s new VR gaming headset is called “Oculus Edge,” and it’s a VR headset that not only uses this sensor in motion to enable this kind of VR gaming, but could also change the way we both do computer interactions more significantly.
A prototype of this headset is actually a real prototype, but is still in the labs. The headset can be put through its paces during this year’s CES run-through.
The VR headset itself is a tech giant, if not the world’s most powerful device. But there’s another side to what it does. With virtual reality, if you’re playing an app and someone walks into your headset, there could not only be that something to see —

The new feature could also help to flesh out how the company attempts to grow its current customer base and new talent.
That’s currently the focus for the new employee onboarding materials. The new feature also suggests ways to differentiate employees when the new employee arrives.

The new process of boarding a new employee focuses on how the new employee will interact with a company. When that person initially arrives, they’re told they’re moving to a new building, and then quizzes are set to find out more about them, and the rest of their experience, before moving to a new home and adopting a new approach to life as a new employee.
The questions are tailored to the industry and the industry level that the company is looking to attract (e.g.        ) and the new employee will also know they’re leaving a more challenging world here. The question to answer is even tougher, because it’s a new challenge with a new level of responsibility. In contrast, if a new employee has only done one job before, the questions may not have as much impact.

A single question asks the new employee his or her role in the company, and it’ll be able to help answer this  question in less than 10 minutes. The question is designed to show a new employee the kind of challenges, highs and lows of a new job.
The questions can also point to a more complicated and nuanced understanding of the problems and challenges that new employees face. It shouldn’t be as easy as just asking about what he’s going to look like for four seconds, and then hoping he’s going to have an answer."
"Today, we hear about a ton of new smartphone maker launching on the world, and how it is going to get onto the market quickly. At today’s Samsung press conference in Seoul, we got in on the device, which has been leaked as Samsung’s next major flagship (well, if you watch the footage, at least).
For those of you keeping count, this is an Android 5.0 handset with a dual-core chip, 2GB of RAM and a 5-megapixel camera capable of capturing 640PPI pics, with the latter being a high-res picture-saver.
The new phone will come in three variants: a $99,000 gold edition, a $149,000 silver edition, or a black edition with a better image quality and a camera that works with the new software Samsung introduces with the Galaxy S5.
Samsung has teased the device in the past, including a teaser video, so we’re looking for the best way to use them before they’re released on the market."
"The next-gen Apple Watch is still only a couple of months away, and already a new leak has popped up that could at least add some much-needed flair to the already impressive looking device. The new Apple Watch has a new interface for accessing apps on your wrist, which could make for a cool new way to use your Apple Watch when you’re done with using it all: video calls.
The leaked video above also shows the UI used on the iPhone; it looks quite familiar to me as early as 2006. (Of course, the Apple Watch’s iOS interface changed dramatically over that same span, apparently, but that’s my story.) And while the video shows the app menu in full, it doesn’t look more like an iPhone interface than an Android one – it looks more like a desktop Internet Explorer alternative, and the text used in the Mac OS Sierra app bar is definitely more readable. This suggests a Windows or Mac version (where that’s not so convenient) would be in order to offer easier access to web content.
And in case you’re also wondering, this is the interface used on the iPhone app in iOS, with icons representing what kind of content you’re sharing. As you can see, the next icon appears below the existing icon, displaying the app icon, and the app’s name and description in bold. In the photo above, the content is called “You&Me”, which also displays the content on the device screen, for those iPhone owners who still don’t get as fancy like they used to be.
The app menu isn’t available yet, but I bet that the next iteration of Apple’s software would allow for user to use a shortcut to access the app on their Watch. Right now, there’s no way to do that, either – Apple doesn’t have a good native app built just for the Apple Watch.
The new interface on Apple Watch would also be a nice complement to a device like the iPhone, given the potential that it’s a standalone camera with no

 info, the most important thing in this equation?”
“Yes, because this is an ad.”
“Is it an ad for an app or a real object? So you can see it, see it, see it better?”
“Yes. It’s real to me… It’s not just an ad. For me, it’s a movie. With this movie, I saw a real thing.”
While the video-and-audio-focused app was exciting, he found using it for other tasks more dull. Using the same app, for example, I can type the name of a tweet, and then it becomes a real object.
He was also curious about “the relationship between the real object and the advertising’s object,” because it turns out that the real thing you can see in the picture is actually the same object you’ll be driving at the same time. It’s a little bizarre, actually. I don’t know how many people would actually get mad at this information, but he did say that in his personal life, he doesn’t like to use a camera in front of the camera. Even so, the reality in the game should be the real thing.
The whole thing is built with heft, in mind, that will make people feel more engaged in the experience. He pointed out that the game will have objects, and if you don’t have an object that fits the pattern of the game, he will create an object to match that, using a program from an author who works at Square. The developer, in turn, will find and build things around that pattern.
In game form, a person gets to ride around and explore the object, and there are visual guides that will help the player navigate the interface within the game world. The best part is that the real thing they can actually do was describe.
He also said that by making real objects a video game, the user becomes a part of the real world when it comes to understanding how different elements work together in different ways on different objects. “The more they learn about physics, how it relates to video games, the more they understand how an object like this affects other parts of the world, and then they become part of that world. That’s very much a real thing.”
This game is a prototype. At this point, the programmer knows the game won’t have very many iterations — He pointed out that the app might just be a “mobile-only prototype that’s the same as an app.” A prospective version could be far more complicated, with “gods and creatures and stuff” coming from different places — in the form of puzzles and puzzles, the way that the game works. It also allows for different parts of this world to talk to each other, which could open up more emergent gameplay aspects to the user.
As Heft and the others work on the game, he said he’s hoping a launched this fall.
Heft’s origins came from a weekend project at Code in Oakland at a time when he said he was looking for something that would feel like a family reunion. What he liked about building something like that, he said, was that it would get used in “really cool and cool applications,” which was why he went with his childhood friend, Erik. He and Rune went to a dinner where they talked about how it all fit together — you build a family and then go through its business process; then you build a ride, and then you come together. Heft had a couple the same ideas about it, and the first was a puzzle game for kids, and they both came up with the idea of building cars and solving different games. They ended up building something along the way: a house, where each object in the game was a vacated object from a different angle, with different game elements.

“It’s not a social network just because I have my own identity” Sankow adds. “It’s a social network for finding good content; we all have social media, but it’s important to be able to find great, entertaining content.”
In the first nine months, a number of startups emerged to solve the problem. The most famous player in this area, TwitVine, was acquired by Twitter, which was also a strategic investor in this area. TwitVine provides a tool to distribute content on Twitter, across social platforms, and also on Twitter itself. TwitVine’s audience is over 130 million active on Twitter. 
Since launching its web-based presence way before today’s official launch as an HTML5 web application, TwitVine has built a mobile platform to power that content distribution, letting consumers distribute and syndicate that content at Twttr. In fact, TwitVine had some 70 million posts on Twitter to date, and more than 1 billion Tweets. 
TwitVine will be offering Twim on mobile platforms as well, and the company is also providing a web-based tool to manage that content. 
The new company is currently the biggest one in the UK TV, but is also developing a distribution partnership with Sony Pictures, along with creating content like Twatifinals, an iPhone and Android app built on TwitVine. 
Twim, is backed by approximately $2.5 million in Series B funding, led by Octopus Capital and others."

Well, that and the “only thing your own company ever does or does not.” Yes, that has been true in other companies from time to time, but it is something that has made us so frustrated. What matters is not exactly who we work with. When you have to do your own thing, your company inevitably hires your own person.
This person becomes the CMO or COO, and in the beginning there is another CTO or CFO, and then maybe one more person joins as CEO or CEO. The CTO or CEE executive can be an industry CTO, so you can tell if it’s a CTO, or a CIO, or an R&D employee. It is usually someone who has a specific vision about how your company will transform into it. If you’re a CIO or COO, your job is to take the company into the next phase of growing your business.
This phase is called growth, and your focus as a CTO in that aspect will likely change with your role and duties outside of those specific roles. So this time it’s important to focus on identifying new companies to do what you do with, where you see the opportunity, whether it is at a company meeting, at a customer meeting, or at a partner event. This has nothing to do with whether or not that is in your company yet — you will figure out when you need it.
There are also a number of questions that need to be answered when you are starting your venture. These include things like “why should I invest this amount? I know this amount, but I don’t know how much.” You need to ask yourself this question because most people have not been able to answer clearly. There will usually be more than one possible answer to this, and you will need to focus on your best option. When there is a clear answer to your question, take these questions into consideration as you proceed.
When we have a clear answer to our questions (e.g. “Why should I invest this amount of money?”) then we are ready to do our work. As our business goes forward I will want to ensure that our company is in full control of our goal to build a profitable business. A startup always is able to take a risk, but when its options turn out to be the best ones, then it is no longer on your side. The last stage is when the most promising company can be acquired.
When this happens our hope that the new investment will be able to help us build on the momentum that we can generate from our new investment and find growth opportunities. But this is the most extreme case: if the new investment is not in alignment with your goals, then you will need to figure out if it’s an appropriate decision to make or whether it is your best fit.
When we have a clear answer to our questions the investor is in fact doing their best work. They get all the benefit of your work and are actually making the right choices as your business grows.
This is really important as you get into these areas, however. There will often be the person who wants to take it all on his shoulders of the job. This is a

�I think what we’re doing is really going to help the world. This year, when it comes to the science of quantum mechanics and everything, I think we’ll be doing something really revolutionary and I think we will do something really revolutionary – we’ll create some new laws. And these laws have implications for science and we will need somebody else to do this stuff.”
But as an entrepreneur and technologist, when a person hears the term “quantum mechanics,” they usually think of the theory of quantum mechanics, rather than what it actually is: a formula that describes how each individual particle of water, gas or air interacts with all the others in a system before the result becomes a universal formula. For those whose ideas fall outside the purist definition, it’s even a bit scary, because for the first time scientists are giving their own definition for something that can be used to solve scientific problems and help humanists solve their problems in a way that is more than a simple rejigger.
As with many good ideas, what actually gets people thinking is the principle of efficiency — the principle of least effort — or “maximize the sum net per unit of input”, as they put it. But that’s where things get complicated: quantum mechanics has a wide meaning for the masses who might end up as the first billion people on the planet.
The principle is in effect across a wide range of domains (and countless applications); in one domain, a person or technology can work with that result to solve a problem, as well as solve the “sinkhole of the universe” metaphor, which is that every decision, every problem, every task has a point of perfection.
So much, in fact, that even today, when a “quantum physicist” explains why one thing or what someone did on the other side of an interaction, one will almost always think of that other thing’s perfection or failure. If there’s enough data out there, there are plenty of other solutions to be designed and applied to.
But when an idea comes from a science scientist, they generally won’t find that it’s that “why would they do that? because that’s not what the science was designed for.” Instead, he or she will think of it as that and explain what that would actually mean to do so.
And that’s what the scientific method and a well thought out application of “the principle of least waste” will lead to. That’s good, because it’s the principle of most of the applications of quantum mechanics that involve people doing something for something.
But it’s not to overstate the importance of a person’s science that it has played a role in the creation of all sorts of new business models and products that will impact millions of people.
“People can be pretty self-critical and they think that we should all do something right now”, says Dorado, “because we created a problem. But it’s this notion that we need to solve it, not be afraid to fail.”
And the irony is that the very reason for this is that quantum mechanics has contributed to a large number of the modern businesses that we know today: from PayPal, and now many others, to Airbnb, Lyft, Spotify and many others — and even companies like Tesla who use computational models to predict the future. There are even a number of new businesses that are still just coming to the world.
Some of them, like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and so on, are also building products for use in quantum physics environments. However, it’s not uncommon to hear stories of major engineering projects that were built in part with the principle of efficiency (and have no parallel).
Quantum mechanics may not have been designed to solve a global problem or to solve specific problems of the human variety, but it clearly has been in the pursuit of them since its earliest form. It’s something in the DNA of the world: in a country that is so highly competitive and so competitive – and so highly competitive in its culture — has the potential to solve a world problem that has many of the same characteristics that we now see in an area like the search space.
So, in addition to those other examples of “the fundamental, fundamental principles of optimization” (from our own), let me offer a few of the more recent ways that physicists today are tackling the space.

The first problem, of course, is one of most common. A problem in quantum physics involves finding the probability of an error from one of the three parameters that are used: 1. Plan. This is sometimes called the square root of the problem

 is a really great way to see that data in a whole new package.
As a point of comparison, the company has invested a good chunk of money into services that help enterprises and consumers view information from different devices and apps across multiple platforms as part of a “cloud" solution.
But the challenge for its enterprise customers is to figure how to find new ways of communicating with data across devices — and this is something that the company faces down the road.
“If the Internet is about the web, when something is important to the enterprise you expect it to run on a different set of devices,” he said. “That’s going to be a challenge.”
At the same time, Smith is betting there is room for some kind of solution in this category. It should also be interesting to see what a lot of the other big players in the market think about next, as they look to figure out how best to combine different types of communications with new types of data — and which ones they’ll be able to combine with them."
"A new study that suggests that the number of professional blog sites has grown 3.7 million since late 2009, with the number of blogs at 476,000, as of last week. The study is based on the annual Gartner website report and includes a survey sent out earlier this year to more than 600 industry experts.
The number of websites with their own brand, or their own branded blogs, has grown by nearly 3.4 million from the third quarter to 2011. As a result, the top brands, such as Google, Microsoft, Cisco, and Barnes&Noblie are now more active on the professional blog sites than their own sites. The report also highlights how marketers are spending money in 2012, when blog sites accounted for 79 percent of total traffic, followed by mobile and social sites.
The data also shows that marketers are increasingly looking beyond the “big 3” media platforms to find content with which to increase traffic and revenue.
As a result, Gartner also says it believes that there are new opportunities to build content marketing platforms aimed at marketers — specifically, they’re looking at platforms where marketers can create content with the “intent to reach a specific audience on social networks — that doesn’t require content to be viral. The survey found that in 2010, the average consumer posted 40 posts per week on 10 different social web sites. This year, it expects this number to be more than 60 posts.
The survey found that the top brands spent $5.5 million in 2011 on marketing campaigns, spending $1.4 million on new marketing campaigns. According to analytics released in late December, the year’s total revenue will be $15.3 million and the number of new campaigns will be nearly 6 billion this year.
Content marketing platforms (i.e., those where marketers create content with an intent of sharing it with you, create products with that intent, and create new products) were the second-largest category, with $4 million in 2011 and $2.7 million in 2012, an increase of 10 percent.  
However, it’s not the “social marketing” platform that Gartner is most bullish on. The report notes that brands spend over $1 billion annually on social marketing services, with a portion of that spending from Facebook as well. The company expects that by 2015, the social marketing business will account for almost 80 percent of total social marketing spend, up from 65 percent last year.
By comparison, the third (and largest) category, which Gartner calls the “publishing strategy,” is coming from the publishing and advertising services business, where marketers spend 1.6 billion dollars per year on a variety of media including blogs, newsletters, web forums, Facebook, mobile, SMS, and video.
These sites, which offer branded content for readers, have a combined reach of 11,000, which in turn have 12,000 unique visitors each month, a large number and growth of over 20 percent from the last year. Gartner also expects 2012 revenue of $15.8 million, with $3.1 billion in EBITDA of $1 million.
But what’s interesting is that Gartner’s top influencers (including The New York Times, Washington Post) are actually doing poorly when it comes to reach, with most authors averaging less than 30 percent of their content reaching 1 percent of fans."
"What do you call a car that sounds like a jet, that sounds like a plane, and that you can even open the door by pushing the “open door” button? What do you call a car that looks like a bird, a unicorn, and everything else in between, and that you can even open it by pushing the “close car” button? I’ll bet it somewhere in between “The Mummy” and

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 just start. At the very first point it was a little outlier that people were getting pissed off because, to a certain extent, the app wasn’t able to deliver a great experience. But, the more I used the app, the more it’s true.
The whole experience, if not quite perfect, is still better than something like Instagram, as you can see in recent comments here.
Of course, this has to do with the fact that you can’t rely completely solely on a friend or random internet celeb to get your photo right. It requires context. And context changes a lot over time, especially if your friend’s picture seems to have a good chance of being right. That kind of context makes Snapjoy appreciateable.
So, the other question is whether the real issue here is one’s selfie’s worth of being right or not.
If someone’s selfie looks good, the app will likely find a way to get the user off the bus by offering them a discount. If it doesn’t it’t get a great photo but makes the photo right, the app probably has a better shot of winning.
If your friend is not as lucky, then it’s more likely that they’ll buy and use their own camera rather than buy a Camera + Snapjoy alone to get your photo from a bad angle. You don’t really need a Camera + Snapjoy to get a portrait, a 360 video, or to make a video.
Snapjoy is working on a video app, which we think would make for a great experience. But video is harder than it is for other apps.


This is partly why Snapchat has been able to make its app the most successful app of all time — it can create an incredible video. But what a video camera is, it requires the photographer to take the time to take a picture of their video. That’s where Snapchat’s app fails as a video camera.
I was not a fan of the idea of a camera app as a means of video creation. I don’t care if someone gives me the option to take a picture or take a video, I would rather have a camera app than something where I was asked to take a picture of my video just to use it up.
The same goes for Instagram. You can make your photos, but it’s hard to make a great app to use yourself or share your art. You have to put some effort and dedication into being a photographer. That’s why Instagram has raised millions of dollars, and why it has taken two years to get any other app off the ground. But as long as there’s more time to spend focusing on visual storytelling, I’ll be more excited about getting a camera app to create my photos.
Because, how do you turn the photo into a camera? You can do that with your filters, but they don’t get access to the camera API, which is what gives the app its potential of being a medium camera.
But while Snapjoy is still very much an experimental application in its infancy — and still has a long way to go in its own right — the app is already doing pretty awesome things. And its app still makes $0.15 ($0.25 to $0.40), so not bad.
For example, the app’s interface was recently overhauled. Now it offers the same filters every single user sees, but instead of simply offering up photos, it will now start tracking your photo and video records and helping to make them available for the app.
The also works even when you’ve switched to landscape. It’s also up to the app’s community to make sure it doesn’t crash. But if you’re used to video, it might be too early to implement all of Snapjoy’s filter options at once.

It’s still early for Snapjoy to go to work in this market with an all-purpose video application. But, based on the app’s early success, it has the potential to become something that’s much better than what Facebook and Instagram have done. After just a year, Snapjoy should start rolling out its product to more people. If it works, it could become a household name.
(Note that the app still appears as a standalone application with no connection to Snapjoy, and that this doesn’t seem like a real product — and if Snapjoy goes down that path, it might not get much traffic.)

 system, when it comes to security,” says Fearsagh.
But he also believes the iPhone is a device that can be used for many other purposes — and that Apple really isn’t doing enough in terms of security, either. It’s an inherently safe place, but the reality is that the risk of bad guys has made the iPhone a haven for the vast majority of our daily use. We don’t use it for, I don’t even look at it to check.
And with Apple’s iOS 7 introduced a new parental controls section designed to protect both parents and kids, the iPhone has become the go-to solution for protecting children, like it is for parents.
“Kids need to be safe and secure and protect themselves. That’s why Apple has this huge audience from day one,” says Fearsagh. “I was working on my kids for two years and then I saw that, so I did think we have problems, but you’ve got the things that they need for their safety.’
The other is the fact that Apple’s software has been downloaded by a lot of kids, who are becoming increasingly mobile. As a company whose consumer hardware is already well known by parents who have kids of their own, the iPhone is an iPhone that gives kids a sense of privacy with regard to everything that you do online.
“That’s why I think you can take a look at the data, and find that kids’ behavior has changed considerably. The only thing that has changed is that kids are becoming more mature and they’re looking for security and protection online, with the first step of parental account and then they’re just using it for the sake of their own sense of privacy.”
Another thing that’s worth noting is that parents looking at the iPhone for other reasons for keeping their kids safe use the app to make sure their kids continue to learn with them, like how Apple offers age-appropriate apps."
"As the online community and discussion for fashion and beauty enthusiasts grows, there’s another area ripe for growth, beyond online fashion stores. And, today comes the news that another, more established player in this vertical has raised a large round of funding. According to a source familiar with the deal, fashion retail giant Zalora, is now working on building a platform that will allow it to leverage its retail footprint in e-commerce, to take on the traditional subscription model for the online retailer. That of course begs the question, “How big in scale does this deal really take?” But what’s interesting is that while Zalora has previously offered a subscription model for beauty-related retailers on a subscription basis, it’s starting to open its door to other types of online retailers who may not want to play by the subscription model by charging companies for services. And while these companies have not directly owned Zalora itself, the source tells us that they are in the first wave of wave II companies, and will soon begin to leverage Zalora’s retail relationships directly on the platform, starting with French fashion retailer Vignoc France, too.
These retailers will be able to better leverage Zalora’s presence in the U.S., and can then offer these brands not only direct access to a significant user base, but are able to target the entire European market, through a partnership with Zalora. The same is true for big fashion retailers in the broader European market as well, says the source.
Both the French and English versions of this report are currently online. The French version has already been published earlier today, and the English version is still in the process of being published."
"While the tech world’s eyes are on Nokia’s big data play, a growing group of startups and technology companies are coming out from Finland with a twist on the Finnish model — that is that they want to get our data into more hands than any single entity. The newest example, Wibidata, is one such example.
Wibidata was founded by four engineers based in Helsinki, Finland. Its platform is based on open source data, which translates to faster processing and processing capabilities. But, unlike traditional data management solutions that just give you big data to store and manage, Wibidata wants data access to become as much a service and the way companies can use it to improve their operations. That is Wibidata is offering a service that lets companies run their data centers on the open source Hadoop platform running on the Wibidata platform.
Wibidata has been running in the public beta for several months and with that it is now starting to make a push to enter the US and Europe. That also makes it an interesting competitor to a company as it comes to mind to try to get into international markets. And of course to compete

 clouds you can see your friends’ profiles, with details like your relationship status, time spent at a business, and activity and interest status of all the people you most interact with on other social networks or on Tumblr, in order to show you more relevant content or offers.
For the more advanced user, they’ll be able to filter the users that appears to their profiles by having to exclude certain users (like their spouse, for example), or setting the age range for all users to prevent those users from dating. It’s a little reminiscent of how you can now filter you contacts on Twitter, so that you don’t see all of their details in the same list, but it’s actually pretty useful for this sort of app.

Of course, there’s nothing stopping someone from using this information to figure out who to include in a new profile. So you’ll be able to connect on Facebook at some point to be verified, but the app won’t show you all your other users’ Facebook statuses or information.
But as of today, the app isn’t getting that much attention outside of Facebook and Twitter, which means it can’t really get any more mainstream usage. That will likely change in time.
The company explains that it’s being used as a way for people to verify their identity on multiple social networks, like Facebook and Twitter, where it gives you a sense if you’re an ador of the service, or get a job. There’s a bit of concern over whether it’s going to be legal for users using this app to “game,” as the app gets called. It’s not. The company says that users are being advised not to use the app in “engaging in online or offline activities requiring the acquisition of virtual goods or services.”
The app is a free download from Google Play here."
"Yahoo continues to look for acquisitions to beef up its advertising efforts: today reported earnings that come out of Yahoo’s third quarter earnings today that beat analysts estimates for $1.36 billion and off a big $1.39 billion range that Yahoo’s board put on the table in spite of strong beatings from analysts. On Monday, when the news first came out, shares were down 1.39 percent in after-hours trading on the news, as Yahoo admitted. The news came out a day after Yahoo confirmed it would buy native ads for mobile in order to beef up its business as a go-to place for advertisers both in the web and mobile ecosystem.
Specifically, Yahoo says it will develop and buy “key assets” and “key products” (like its advertising products), as well as invest in developing its mobile advertising infrastructure. Yahoo said revenue in the quarter ending in December rose 46 percent to $3.4 billion, a big spike on the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin was up 49 percent to $21.5 million.
On the earnings call, the company’s CEO Marissa Mayer was quick to defend what she said she was doing as CEO at Yahoo: “I think it’s a really special time for Yahoo. We’ve had more time than any time in our history,” she said. “This is a global effort where Yahoo is taking on the challenge.”
“It’s no time doing it alone,” she added.
This is the first investment that Yahoo has made in advertising for mobile, and this adds to another strategic role that Yahoo is making in the area. Last month, for example, CEO Marissa Mayer hired away Jeff Mason to help oversee its digital ad program, which also puts to work in ads for search, Flickr and others.
While she didn’t have specific figures for the investment, Mayer made the same general point as when the first round of mobile-first hires were made — that if you’re looking to build a mobile advertising empire, you want “specific talent”.
Last Thursday, when the deal with native ads first got announced, she noted it would take Yahoo longer to implement the buyout for its core assets.
In its place, Yahoo has invested in some areas to improve the existing platform and also to grow the number of mobile-first businesses and those businesses, as well as building better advertising technology.
“It’s about creating a network of products and technologies that improve the ad experience on mobile devices,” she said on the earnings call today. “We’ve been expanding on the back of the product. When we started, mobile was being underdeveloped and underserved because of legacy software and technology not being developed to market effectively for that.”
She noted that in the third quarter, there were

 paying a membership fee, but if the site’s user base exceeds what it already does, it gives the company a way to offer premium features as a way to attract new users, increase engagement and monetize the company’s paid services.
That’s not to say that this is good news, however.
“We have had a lot of discussions internally that have yet to come to fruition,” said cofounder Eric Rigby and CTO and CTO Dan Zumino. “We have to start with the business model and product.”
It’s not clear what kind of engagement is being generated by The Million Dollar Home, however, or what the site will be able to charge — the post itself and an announcement will be more about the brand itself than the product. One of the perks, as Zumino shared with me, is that The Million Dollar Home will be able to generate any leads whatsoever without offering a minimum fee (a $1,000 minimum fee doesn’t apply, either).
The startup also recently acquired its first service providers and started testing a new way for its users to interact with their content, through a private messaging feature it launched last summer with the aim of becoming more of a social network than a collection of short, personal messages.
The startup also announced the new app, Home Page, earlier this week, which will be available later this month."
"“We want to be the platform for your photos.” “We want to be the platform for your documents.” What about Google+? What about Instagram and Whatsapp? What about Skype and Viber?”
Today, Box has just made this decision with the official launch of Android, the company confirms to be launching its new messaging client Android-first within Q1 2013. There’s also a major update for Google’s “All Platforms” product, with lots of integration with the cloud and social features, plus social sharing. This means that, in a sense, Android is becoming the first OS for Box. If Google is going to use its services for other services, it will be Android-first, and Android will be the first OS for Box."

Box launched at the end of spring 2012 with a new application called Box Video. The service is designed for mobile devices and web browsers, in order to use an app for capturing and sharing videos from within a video. The idea is that a video (it’s either a web-based or desktop-based experience) can provide better experience on smartphones than other forms of video captured from the desktop. In a nutshell – that’s how it works as explained in a recent blog post. But the service is also something that has been a boon to many of us at Box. The video capturing experience is far better in terms of fidelity than other third-party solutions.
As a bit of background on the company itself: Back in August, Box announced the launch of a new video-recipient app called Changel2 that it developed in partnership with Panasonic. The app was a bit of an experiment for Box this time in that, while it is an obvious competitor to services like Facebook Live with Live streaming (an app that was also built for Box), it was also more of an improvement on the experience of downloading videos on video and viewing them on your home screen and directly through the Chrome browser.
The experience, when it launched, was the same experience that it works on the Web. But the concept was something that many people had been requesting which was why we initially brought on Box CEO. Now, we understand why that was the case.
But it remains to be seen how effective those were in terms of the company, as it turns out. We understand that the CEO left yesterday, to be replaced by Richard Stoll, who is known to have been involved in the company from its early days.
Now, back to the latest news from Box. The company is unveiling its new mobile application Succeed, a successor to something the company already put in place as a product called Box Mini that, like the existing platform, has integrated seamlessly with existing applications in order to offer a single interface that works like the Google+ and YouTube user interfaces. The service is in Beta testing now, but when it opens up in Q1 2013, Box will add a social layer, too. (See below for a more brief

 has more than 10,000 users today, and it’s not currently breaking out any new milestones at this time. However, it’s interesting that the startup has taken advantage of Apple’s popularity as it is its top-selling platform. With some of its biggest and most passionate customers, Apple does make appointments. At this juncture, you can expect more app-first initiatives in the future to show just how important app-first initiatives are to Apple. This is Apple’s most popular platform of choice on which to launch third-party projects that extend the Apple-brand and expand the Apple ecosystem to create additional value for users."
"Apple is planning to release a larger version of its 12-inch iMac at the end of this week, according to MacRumors — the company confirms the iMac will add a 12.8-inch version of the Macbook Pro 10K, along with a much larger screen, more USB ports, and a new built-in keyboard control. Apple plans to add the keyboard in the iMac, the same way it did on last year’s iMac, with a new built-in trackpad, the new Mac’s third-party controller, and new options to expand the existing iMac. The new MacBook Pro, for instance, has a new trackpad (pictured above) that includes a second touch wheel, which Apple revealed on stage at the company’s recent event in Las Vegas in September.
The iMac also adds an LCD Touchpad on the top of the board to control the second, third and fourth button on the Mac’s screen, and is rumored to get the same new Bluetooth keys the iMac’s design already supports, according the report.
Other spec features include a USB Type-C port on Mac, an SD card slot on Mac, a mini-HDMI port on the Mac Pro, and a Wi-Fi card slot on the Mac. However, the 13-inch version, which is also available in either a 32GB or 32GB SSD version, is the most interesting on paper.
The new MacBook Pro also appears to include a built-in screen for a new OLED-friendly 3,500mAh (non-removable) battery, which provides around three to five hours of use in a full charge, according to Apple’s recent reports. The display is a glossy, metallic cylinder of sorts that features a single button on the underside of the Mac, which makes the iMac appear like the touchscreen screen on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1."
"There’s a new, more detailed design for the forthcoming Apple Watch hardware. The watch can actually now be configured to have multiple display options that turn the watch into a dual-screen experience depending on how you configure it, a new report out today suggests.
The details, which are revealed via an open design process in iOS 7.1 (which is the first major update to Apple Watch software since it debuted back in September prior to Apple Watch earlier this year), is confessed to being the actual case in question, and there are even different rumors suggesting it might contain a physical, rather than touchscreen, keyboard and touchpoint reposits.
Apple also apparently didn’t think to ask much of a design team to build these watches so far – a more detailed report on Apple Watch design suggests the watch won’t have the display Apple is touting in the official report.
The report, which we’ve heard is accurate from initial impressions, is based on some design speculation in addition to actual manufacturing that could reveal what kind of the thing is actually in terms of a design goal that Apple is pursuing in terms of Apple Watch hardware.
One report has it that the Apple Watch could have a stylus that can work, for instance, as part of its case. While that’s not a great way to suggest that a future device in this case is designed to be a secondary display, some idea is to hint at what might be a potential future where the Apple Watch becomes a more powerful addition to your iPhone’s case design.
In many respects, this report says that the first Apple Watch will launch in a limited beta first year first, to let the watch grow from the early customer base into the hands of testers and developers, and then into a broader release sometime next year, all the way down to a more general release in early 2015, possibly in time a few years hence.
The smartwatch rumor is that Apple is looking to get more than 100,000 testers and then into mass production, as it seeks to figure out what people really want in terms of a product design.
One potential is that a larger display Apple could put in your lap, a

:000 by July, with those people then going to try to get their money back. For now, it’s a more seamless way to handle that process than sending emails to people’s email addresses. For example, with people making up to $150 a year, one would have to send them an Excel spreadsheet. Next, there’s PayPal, PayPal or something like Google Apps.

But the company doesn’t have all these options yet. After all, there are companies like Stripe that offer the same thing, and companies like Square that do a little better. In the future, Zowee wants to incorporate support in the Stripe API from Stripe and Facebook or other companies. And if Stripe wants to integrate more deeply, it could take a while — the API still has a long way to go.
So far, Zowee has only raised $500,000 from GGV Ventures and some other investors, so it’s been bootstrapping. The money will be used for hiring, for marketing, and for product development. The Android app, in particular, needs a lot of work because it’s missing a lot of components that make it a marketplace like Kickstarter. It would also be great if the company would support multiple currencies — $50 was supposed to be a good amount of backing, but $150 was not enough — and the website was a bit buggy. I’m working on a mobile version for mobile, but in the future there are probably some other features I should add.
The company is also working on the backend, and the Android app will be a lot nicer. A lot of the new features will be in the Android app, like a marketplace to let users save their payments for future purchases. Payments should be easy to complete on the Android app, too. And there’s an email API to make payments easier to some accounts. The backend also needs a lot of work. I understand I have a limit in the Android app, I’ll see what happens. I will reach the limits within the mobile app, what I think is going to happen is this amount of data. I just realized I have a lot more than 100MB. I need to figure it out.
Zowee’s social graph could be useful. I’m a person who buys things, who researches a lot about my friends, who’s following me on Twitter. If someone follows me, it’s a signal that I have some type of relationship. On Facebook they create a social graph that gives me interests. It could create a network that I’ll follow on Twitter and LinkedIn. A lot of my tweets and Facebook updates are probably already public on those social networks.
The company also wants to improve the way people discover events. Right now, if you want a company to show an event, you need Facebook login information. If you don’t have Facebook login info you can either type in something like “events” or email you can go to their profiles on the web and see their email address. That information is not public when you go to the company’s profile page. It could be useful for getting users on the service who wouldn’t normally commit to being there. You can connect directly on LinkedIn, Twitter and Snapchat to your events page.
Zowee isn’t just about commerce. It lets customers research a service to find the best rate. It can help with pricing and prices, find a nearby bar and shows all events inside, and even shows you how many minutes it will take you. That’s why it’s the first-mover for a new service I’ll be using.
The company is pretty good at getting stuff into people’s hands with a little help. It could try to acquire some new users by offering paid events. It’s growing and it’s trying to figure out what not many people are doing in their spare time, so it needs to get its users engaged."
"There are a number of startups that help businesses track where visitors came from, what ads were seen, and what marketing campaigns were used, but one of the key challenges with doing this is getting the right user data. Today Gartner is releasing some estimates on how some of those efforts might be succeeding.
The report (based on tracking 1.5 billion impressions per day for 50 different mobile apps between March of this year and January of last), reveals that for the first time, mobile app analytics company Flurry has recognized more than 80 percent of all mobile ad impressions made on its platform. In other words, more than 60 percent came from organic to paid campaigns. (Flurry uses that number to define its own “mobile ad campaign” and to classify the rest of the web’s ad

 brothers. The company does say that it’s working on a mobile application.
With the new funding, Cogimobile will also be expanding to more platforms, including Android and iOS. And the company will look to start to partner with other mobile ad networks and offer additional services tailored to mobile consumers."
"It’s good to be part of Facebook. It’s good to be a part of Instagram. It’s good to be a part of Twitter. It’s good to be a part of Tumblr. And of course, it’s good to be a part of the Internet. What’s not to love about all of these things?
The Internet, in all its glory and power, has come to us for many of its years without much in the way of governance and control. The web itself is still incredibly unbalanced to such a degree that you have to put a firewall between the people you interact with and the people you follow.
There’s a lot of fun to be had in the Internet: an infinite resource. A huge volume of information coming from a large number of sources. An equally vast amount of control over the content of the web, even the information coming from the Internet itself.
That’s what the Internet itself is, in all its glory and power. And it’s a power that should be enjoyed.
But the Internet isn’t being made more or more democratic.
In fact, there’s no democracy for the Internet. There’s no democracy for the web or mobile or the web for the most part.
No one is making the rules, the Internet itself is. As is true of all the web, the people who interact with the internet do.
It’s not Facebook, as all the other democratizing trends we’ve seen in the web have been created and pushed by the owners of it and are now using the Internet to change the world. In fact, the only democratic model it has — “organic” — is in places like the US, where people simply don’t feel entitled to participate in this capacity. No one else is allowed to create the power structure of the Internet in this way. The other way of looking at it is the Internet itself is as a voting system. And it’s not democracy.
No one should have power over the Internet. They shouldn’t have. Just like that’s not true of the internet. Yet, to ask people for a vote is a mistake.
That’s an error.
So let’s take another look at some examples of things that are not democracy at play. These are not democracies for the first wave of Internet users; these are all just votes. There are no single voting points for the web, no one has much power over the nature of the web itself. No one is to make decisions, or to run the world.
And yes, all of them are coming up with these things, too. But are we getting all these users just to go and do everything for a few seconds in order for Twitter to register and be allowed to use this tool?
This is not true.
There are many other methods of voting, many more democratic ways of voting — but many of them are not designed to take the place of traditional democracies. The user has no voting power; the user does.
And yes, when you use some of the more democratic methods of voting to govern your own life, it does not feel democratic. In fact, it feels authoritarian. This is no democracy; it is no democracy.
This is no democracy. It is not democratic.
There is no democracy for the web for an Internet user. It’s a new way of looking at the world that requires new ways to look at existing democratic models, as well as new ways of looking at the world.
There is no democracy for mobile or video. It’s a new world without the mobile, so it’s possible to do without necessarily needing a mobile or video device. It does look a bit like the old Internet without, you might say.
There is no democracy for photos or video. We are not in the world of photos or video when it comes to social media.
It is a new global network that does not require more or more devices to use it. Our social media will remain on whatever device suits us.
The Internet itself is not a democracy. It’s a new global network that is not based on voting points or anything else. It’s a new global network that has no voting points, no one to vote against, no one to vote for and no ones to join. Just as no one is required to join a group in order to join a club in order to make its decisions.
The Internet itself is no more “democratic” than is the Internet itself. You are,

 that they have to make an offer in 10 days, the average turnaround is a day. “You need to get a lot of the content that they’ve been putting in there over a lifetime.”
The deal to get content in front of more users is not out of the blue, as it’s a bit more than just another monetising strategy for a mobile internet platform.
“I think that a lot about what Spotify is all about is the way they’ve been treating music,” he says. “If I’m someone like me, I have to be able to have the chance to hear what’s going on. I can hear something I’m hearing, but it would be terrible. It wouldn’t be pleasant hearing that’s going to sound awful. So I don’t think about it like that. I’ve got this app that’s called ‘all the songs in your library’ and it’s a little bit of music that I just couldn’t find on other apps. When I hear something, my head hits over a thousand, I just don’t understand why it won’t just be in my library and nothing that’s going on.”
What’s more interesting is that this deal will give Shazam more information on what other listeners would be listening to as well, so at the end of the day, Shazam can offer up more data to advertisers to show them how it can deliver more content. If users can be convinced about the value in their listening experience then they’ll be more willing to pay for marketing services.
But the bigger vision is one that extends Shazam’s business to include advertising as well, as it explores ways of selling more apps and hardware. Right now Shazam’s main focus is on music, but eventually it will be looking to expand those into other types of media, too, says O’Driscoll.
As for the business model, it sounds like the company is considering a revenue share with Shazam for the upcoming year or so. “If we work with Shazam, there’s a couple of things that we’re exploring, one is how would this work in a revenue share model, secondly how could we be a profitable business that’s independently owned by Shazam and not just being a partner partner,” he says. “It seems like an exciting future… That would help the company make the right decisions and it would help us grow the business.”
Right now Shazam is just about music — in fact, the company has partnered with Apple on music videos. “If that’s the case, then in the next couple of months, we’ll be adding additional features at the same time,” says O’Driscoll. In some ways, this is the same strategy as the one used by Shazam’s competitor Rhapsody — the latter company was acquired by Sony Music Group last year.
At the same time Shazam is playing to its strengths. “I still love how the Shazam for music works,” says O’Driscoll. “It still feels like the best possible experience that’s using Shazam. We’re proud of it. We’re going to use this opportunity to reach new audiences that way, to build on what we’ve launched over the past year.”"
"Budget music service SoundCloud is today announcing its latest acquisition, in the form the acquisition of social marketing startup Grow. In a blog post, SoundCloud notes that this is the first acquisition of Grow that the company has made outside of its parent company SoundCloud to further “expand” its ad business. “Grow will help SoundCloud grow its advertising business and ad platform without the need for additional engineering resources. We’re thrilled to bring Grow’s talented ad team into SoundCloud. We’re also excited to welcome a highly talented and profitable team from Grow to the family. We’re looking forward to bringing their technology and growing the SoundCloud ad platform.”
Grow was founded with a mission, says SoundCloud, to “radicalise social marketing” — this idea going back to the beginning of Internet advertising. But how radical was this vision? Well, for instance, at the time when they were still just a few employees, Grow was already processing $2.3 million in sales per month. SoundCloud notes that it’s now at 30 million users and is bringing in $10 million per month in revenue, with half of that coming from advertising.
Grow will complement that team to help SoundCloud grow the team

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 it’s also the launch of the newest version of our Android application, “Pocket” (a “personal savings account” for Android users, including myself, unfortunately now that this functionality is included in version 1.2, because we just couldn’t get enough testing data, so we’re not making any plans there yet.) — all new users will also now have their original savings stored in a single “Pocket” account.
Although Pocket is being offered initially for individual use, the startup’s team is already seeing a number of businesses using the service, including those that sell subscriptions, stock, and coupons to users, and those that charge a small “Pocket” fee that gets applied to all of a company’s accounts and, therefore generate potentially substantial amounts of customer revenue. These businesses could charge to start Pocket, but they could also create and use Pocket for their existing customers, or those they were trying to sign up for later, or those they wanted to reach and target based on their existing behavior, like “pay,” for example.
To generate its initial revenue, Pocket will begin work at the retail level, and will introduce the “Pocket” option for businesses that want to integrate Pocket with a retailer’s online wallets. Those already working with Pocket will be able to view their wallet’s balance at any time (a feature that has been available in prior versions of the application), view a list of upcoming balances, and select items to add to their own Wallet or to those saved in Pocket.
The company is currently working with over a dozen merchants and retailers, with the hope that its mobile platform will reach a wider range of customers. And it does indeed seem to be taking the “consumerization” to the enterprise: Pocket has already been deployed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and is now being used by some 25,000 locations nationwide.
Pocket is backed by $750,000 in funding from undisclosed U.S. and U.S. government sources, and the founders believe that the new funding will be used to grow its team and its focus on small to medium-sized and family-oriented businesses. “We believe we are poised to revolutionize personal finance by bringing its innovative approach to the masses – making Wallet a place where every family member or friend can enjoy,” added Dorsey in the introduction."
"It was a very quiet last few weeks, until today. For most of the time the press was focused only on Apple’s upcoming event in Cupertino, and nothing much happened, save for the company revealing a brand new patent application for its Smart Key technology. Now, however, Apple is dismissing an app that it unveiled back in 2011 with a substance that, well, isn’t too subtle about what it thinks its new feature replaces, instead of a whole new device.
Specifically the app was concerned about your “personal information” being leaked on the network, and it asked you to protect that information by putting yourself “in proximity of any user”, regardless of whether your phone or not, which didn’t work as advertised. It appears, however, that the Smart Key app was already a popular part of the iOS ecosystem at the time – and this new version doesn’t change that feeling, at least not in terms of functionality.
The new Smart Key app is called Easy Shift, and as I mentioned above it requires the smartphone to be in your pocket when it’s near you in order to work, which may or may not work for some folk who have no issues with always being around the service at all times, but who are still fine with swapping out their phone every day for work, or who don’t mind losing their contact list for a better contact discovery mechanism (as opposed to something like Hangouts in the enterprise).
In terms of what’s new today’s release of the updated app does, rather than what’s changed since the last app Apple released, it does change that.
Apple says that the new app looks almost as if it’s just a rebranded version of “Lockitron” by the product design teams of Apple and Samsung, which introduced the lock screen back then in 2011 on the iPhone 5 and later. With this release you’re swapping with your existing Lockitron, so long as the phone has been in your pocket as of March. But that was a very different direction in terms of development from Apple’s original product.
Easy Shift was originally focused on making the product simpler to use, but then later on adding new features. It does this by making your phone so it’s near you that it can act like a smart cover when you’re

 down at the moment is that they’re going to want to be the first to get to a deal."
"There’s no doubt that digital music sales are continuing to fuel a surge of streaming companies entering the space. And now, in December The Beatles’ catalog (all of their music) is going to get more and more mainstream. And just because Spotify gets all the credit for offering users a choice in how they pay for music doesn’t mean everyone will follow suit. According to Kantar Worldpanel Comtech, Apple and the Beats Electronics brand in particular are leading the digital music category in terms of revenue last year — which should bode well for a similar move in the year ahead.
But while the growth of the digital music units is encouraging, they’re actually decreasing in importance overall. The music industry says that the “CD” dollar in the U.S. only made up 12% of the total in 2012. In December it was only 15%. In December 2010 and 2011, when CD sales were still king, the industry says that the music revenue was more than double that of CD revenues. Since, that picture has flipped and today the top two digital music companies are down by 10%, in part because they’re competing with each other and with other players (like Pandora). Their combined market caps, too, are down by more than 20%.
A similar story is unfolding in the movie industry. Despite having a long and varied history, a decade ago movie studios were essentially using CD sales to make a profit. Now they are losing out to digital music units in the entertainment field. In December there were 3.7 million movies being released with digital music. This year there will be only 1.7 million films, down from 24.1 million in 2010.
So a bit about why the change is happening and how it’s affecting the music industry:
The music industry in January of last year said that sales of digital music units had increased by 3% of the total in 2012, to $57.8 billion. This increase had been driven by the CD in particular but also was reflected also in the overall revenue decline, according to Kantar Worldpanel Comtech:
The music industry is clearly feeling the crunch in the market. Although iTunes, iHeart, Rdio, SoundCloud, and YouTube are still the most popular streaming and download services, they’re all losing money. That could be because they are cannibalized by mobile phone and tablet devices, too (which are pushing into the mainstream).
The growth of digital music units is another factor contributing to lower unit margins. The lower unit margins have not gone away entirely, even as the volume of digital music has been dropping. But the overall point of the change is far bleaker.
“The change in the marketplace is creating higher unit monetization and lower gross margins. The unit monetization of the digital music business is now lower than it was in 2009 and 2010’s numbers indicate,” writes Kantar Worldpanel ComTech analyst Ben Morris, in a statement. The analyst noted that the first-two months of the year saw unit merchandising revenues of $936.6 billion versus $719.6 billion in the same period last year, which both years were flat compared to the same period a year earlier.
This is a drop in unit sales and a dip in revenues but it’s going to keep the price labels and artists making money from digital music units a huge part of the battle for digital music sales on the market.
“As the unit-priced digital music devices enter the mainstream, artists and artists are making less in royalty and less in revenue. If these devices succeed like the digital music players, their success will depend in large part on the industry’s ability to attract these consumers and attract the movie industry and the game creator.”
We see a lot of speculation that the music industry will need to do more in terms of ways to encourage these lower-priced units in the future. That could include other forms of digital content, like virtual goods, rewards, and new services and more. This would mean fewer streaming exclusivity deals and more potential for indie musicians to become more prevalent in the industry (something also worth watching for with Apple’s forthcoming iTunes Music. Not to mention that iTunes Radio is coming to other platforms.)
This is a very different approach from that of a decade ago, when you could sell music for $20 or $40 per year. “The consumer would have to go out and buy an album — they couldn’t buy an album on iTunes or anywhere else.”
It’s also a turn to the music industry not only as a whole but also a more digital one — and one to look to for answers to how to create an environment where consumers could buy digital music (and music fans might not be so enthused — at least not for the foreseeable future)."

. But these are just three examples of how social media is growing faster and growing more diverse.
And it’s not just in the realm of technology. It’s also in how we talk about it. As you may have guessed, when someone tweets something on Twitter, others follow to follow along, too.
We’ve seen various “likes” before. And, not long after a “love” gets posted, the popularity of another’s opinion carries it’s weight.
It turns out that what this means is that people are using social media for good reasons. There’s a reason why our smartphones are constantly ringing.
And just as we can expect, the “like” button has morphed into become a very mainstream, yet still confusing phenomenon.
Many have talked about the importance of “liking” — in a positive way — in order for a consumer product to become a success.
But is the “like” button truly good? Is it just a passing fashion trend?
To find out, we decided to dive into the world of opinion sharing and analysis to see what’s happening, and what the people who wield the power to shape opinions on social media are actually doing.
There have been many studies done in this area over the years. The most comprehensive is probably this TED Talk by Dr. Robert Van Zant, co-founded at Stanford in 2004. Van Zant explored the psychology of opinion sharing and the role of emotion in opinion formation, and offered a great example of why a ‘Like’ button works so well.
He noted that while there are plenty of companies that have attempted to “raise” opinions on social networks, most have failed to take advantage of the data collected from the likes of Facebook users in aggregate and aggregate over time.
What people really want to know, he said, is if a piece of content is popular over time and when and how that content is used and shared; if a particular piece is popular over time and when others share it; if the conversation is about something specific and individual, and not about anything collective.
Is this data really being used in the aggregate? It appears so. Below is a list of the average number of views, responses and engagements that have taken place on the “Like” button.

The above data shows that the average “Like” engagement (both the view count, response count and engagement rate) has increased from 1.4 times when a topic is shared over time and 5.2 times when a user is “liked.” The majority of these Likes are from Facebook — the only real data source that counts is Twitter.
People also like to like other people’s Facebook posts and comments, so when people talk about it on Twitter, opinions may spread — although, again, the data shows that the average Like per conversation (that’s the total Like count per person) is a fraction of a single click.
But how does this all work?
To create a view counts, replies and engagement data, the companies must first identify individual Likes and “Likes” each, and analyze how all views are trending over time (since the Likes are generated by people Liked most recently).
Next, they must identify the most popular opinions over these responses and engagements. If the engagement rate is greater than 5 percent, they can get a sense for the sentiment. The data shows that when there is a positive sentiment over another person’s likes, it tends to spread by three times, with the strongest positive likes being shared by the most liked user.
So, where do people Like most over time? Over time, what other content shared over social media varies, and there is variability from one user to the next, so this data can help users to decide whether their preferences are actually being shaped by others, over time.
Once they have identified the view counts, users can determine if their own responses are similar or negative — or if their “Likes” are actually more positive than they are over time.

This data can also be used to refine Facebook user data analytics over time, and inform consumer privacy policies, Facebook ads, and other policy decisions. But Facebook won’t have to rely on any one data source. It can take the views, responses, engagements, and preferences of individuals on Twitter, Facebook, and more and provide those insights to Facebook over time.

"Social gaming is, as you’d expect, one of the fastest-growing categories in development in the last few years. And in the last year, it seems like the entire field has gone from “PC” to “console gaming” and everything in between, and a whole lot of gaming companies are quickly following suit.
But there’s still an enormous diversity of companies in

 of its own, it was not the original design that got in the way and led to the acquisition.
The new app is also a bit too complicated to use for a layperson, and a bit too heavy, to be very practical. You only have to remember to start adding things to your photo book once and then stop once you’ve got the album closed. After that it can’t get any simpler for some photo-sharers. And if it’s broken open, the company says the app will work much better.
The new version is live on iTunes right now, with the Android app yet to come."
"The Apple Watch isn’t just for the tech industry fanboy crowd, however, which is really good for the company to launch. If you own a smartwatch, like the Pebble, you’re probably thinking of adding a companion iPhone to your smart arm at some point along the way. However, some consumers aren’t thinking of putting a new iPhone on their wrist or taking advantage of an accessory like the LG Watch Urbane, as the company recently revealed.
Rather, the new LG+ Watch Urbane is a “modular” smartwatch, with a rear-facing AMOLED display, a heart rate sensor, pedometer, and more that allows you to use your wrist (and watch) as a sensor to detect things like how aggressively someone is wearing their device, when they’re using it, and more.
In case you missed the live stream of the LG+ Watch Urbane, it features the same round face that was currently present on the LG G Watch. The new heart rate sensor looks to track your pulse, temperature, altitude and movement and the accelerometer, GPS, compass, and gyroscope will alert you when your phone is within a certain range of a certain height.

The original G Watch has three different watchfaces, including the square face that you find found on the smartwatch – the LG G Watch S is the bigger brother, with both a circular, 3,000-pixel display plus a sub-pixel sensor to provide up to eight readings per second of activity.

LG’s new watch features a sub-pixel heart rate sensor so you can measure how actively you’re moving and when a user’s heart is reaching a certain range. This will determine your current calorie intake, number of hours, and more, tracking your breathing and breathing rates. It also has a sub-second accelerometer that’s good for 100 nautical knots as well as a silent vibration motor that will wake up the G Watch Urbane when the accelerometer senses a person is entering the bath, as well as other potential health and fitness functions, including swimming, gym, running, etc.

You can see the LG+ Watch Urbane on display at the bottom of the GTV video above. It’s a nice, simple piece of technology, however, in that it’s not just a gimmicky feature. The LG G Watch S acts as a great accessory for the G Watch, or as a companion Apple Watch, if paired with your iPhone, Android Wear watch, or even the forthcoming Apple wearable – the Pebble is a distant third, but both have great potential to bring the consumer attention to wearable tech, while offering a number of potential functions and a slew of differential input. It’s still early to make any definitive choice, but the LG+ Watch Urbane and its companion app, which is available for Android today, looks to provide lots of potential to those who may be looking to move in the right direction."
"Last fall, a New York-based startup called RunKeeper came out of stealth mode with its platform for running sessions on the smartphone. The company launched with $1,400 in seed funding and a $6,000 cap, and with 18,300 users, was going to need to quickly grow if it was going to become a breakout hit.
But in the summer months it hit a major milestone: 400,000 registered users. That’s when the company decided to reveal its pricing to a select group of users, giving the service a “freemium” model. Starting around $14.95/month, RunKeeper is selling subscriptions to a group of users, with $25 to $35 a month. That means a user can start at $5/year — or a new user can buy and add them for $5/month.
That’s all well and good, but what’s interesting is that this number is based on user input/usage. So a high percentage of users who have bought and are using the service is paying, but also those users are likely paying a percentage of the service, as well. So the higher percentage (higher’%) may be due to more people who are paying.
The company has been expanding by acquiring (

 experience their day-to-day lives.
The company’s website today offers a number of pre-assessed templates for users. For instance, users can select to receive free shipping, free shipping on same day orders with a 3-day shipment delay for free with a click of a button.
After completing the pre-assessed order form, the service automatically matches you up with a shipping service provider and sends the request to a mobile app. Shipping isn’t free: Postmates charges its users $9.99 per order on all shipments but says that the company averages about 25% fee per shipment, which works out nicely for those orders.
Postmates says that about 95% of order requests come for delivery within 7 to 10 days, with the customer ordering from over 40 countries in all. A full delivery takes 18 to 24 hours and a lot of orders arrive by the time the customer reaches Postmates for shipment with delivery that is usually arranged on an as-if-tact, rather than a “delivery guy” approach.
The company also offers free cash refunds, a couple of days free shipping after customers cancel the order, and free shipping on orders over $25.
To make this possible, Postmates has raised $7 million in funding from a number of investors including Khosla Ventures and an unnamed investment group in New York.
What the company is working on now is mobile apps for Android and iOS, and a mobile experience specifically optimized for tablets. The company recently brought on the former VP of the New York City Department of Retail, Michael Dearing.
Update 10am: Postmates has also said it will shut down. It will lay off 70 employees in the next round of cuts to cut costs, but it is not making any public comments at this time. We’ll know more when the company posts its plan to raise a series B by the end of the year."
"Google’s Nexus 5 is already out at Best Buy, and it appears there was even more news today involving the company and the Nexus 4. While they’re not officially sold out, new information is leaking out at one store specifically. The same store, Best Buy, showed off Google’s latest Nexus 4, alongside what it’s called a “Nexus 5″ device.
The leaked information is based on a couple of hours of data being gathered by Google from its Nexus 4 site, which has been popping up just in time from an earlier leak. Most devices, like the Nexus 4, are sold out on a day or so after their initial release and even on Amazon. It’s unclear whether or not this is the same leak, and there isn’t much to see from it.
The leaks suggest that Google’s Nexus 4 is a mid-range device, and that the Nexus 5 is a mid-range device. The Nexus 5, of course, is very similar to the Nexus 4 in terms of specs and performance, and it would be wise to expect other leaks to come, too, with similar leaks. But it’s safe to assume we can expect lots more about the Nexus 5 here."
"Apple’s biggest iOS 8 update came in iOS 7 back in June, and it brought a whole host of changes to stock Android. The first notable change in many ways was the introduction of the lock screen, but the second biggest is the addition of the Notification Centre, which introduced a number of new features like Quick Reply, a way to reply to emails with a “Yes” or “No” based on context, and Spotlight Search, which let you find Siri and Spotlight queries.
If you’re trying to get the latest version of an older version of a top-of-the-line iOS iPhone, chances are you’ve noticed too. When you’re using your device with the latest version of the operating system, you’re going to notice. It’s no good to be forced to upgrade immediately, and in the meantime, that’s an easy way to reduce frustration. Apple wants a way to make sure its iPhone 5s and 5c get the latest and greatest features, but there’s also more need for a simple way to update the device itself, and it’s making it a bit easier than just locking your phone.
The update comes a day after Samsung dropped a blog post to its own site, as suggested by Samsung’s recent Galaxy S5 launch, where they announced a new partnership with Samsung. Samsung had promised consumers it would get something like this for years to come, but they delivered with an actual device to boot. It’s a nice little addition to their devices, and I’m surprised that consumers didn’t notice it sooner than they did. I’m sure Apple will be looking to capitalize on this to help it gain market share and popularity in the future

 push an advertising-centric new service called Ads on Demand.
This marks an evolution for AdRoll, which was founded in 2007 and grew to cover ads to social and digital media. It’s taken over the platform, which was bought in 2011, acquired by AdRoll in 2013.
AdRoll CEO Jon Weiss spoke earlier this year about the move and a big bet on digital media:

However, AdRoll’s original service for tracking ads didn’t quite pan out. That’s because, over time, Facebook took over the social ads space. The service is currently only used by a number of advertisers on the AdRoll platform, including Facebook.com, Microsoft, Twitter, the NBA, Yahoo, YouTube, as well as the NFL and Google. This represents the first time the company announced an ad-buying service on its platform.
In its announcement, AdRoll explains that by integrating its technology into AdRoll’s platform, it “gives its customers unprecedented access to ad targeting technology, leading to billions in savings.”
According to AdRoll, the ad-buying service, called AdRoll Ad Exchange, combines online trending ads with social and display ads. It can also help AdRoll customers to reach new or existing customers based on their behavior.
The service will be on the AdRoll platform for free, with its acquisition of Tune, the ad service company acquired by Facebook, for $8.7 billion.
“AdRoll has provided an essential tool for small marketing teams to deliver and distribute dynamic social ad campaigns. For AdRoll, this is an important acquisition which expands ad platform offerings for a broader range of online marketing companies that are looking to expand their footprint in social media marketing,” Kapurvel said in the launch release."
"A London-based startup called Slacker is looking to change the way you track your online activity and discover new services. You probably know this startup from its earlier efforts for connecting musicians and musicians, but Slacker wants to also be a general way to track the health, fitness and general wellness things in your home, whether it’s tracking your activity, sleeping patterns or just finding out what kind of stuff your living room air looks like.
The product, Slacker, works by listening to your stuff, and sending you a push notifications when it detects issues. You don’t have to open the app to find the issues, in many cases, so Slacker can make recommendations as you go to help you find the problem, or you can manually dig those things out using a slider on the left.
For example, you might be asking your Slacker for a guide for how to find and treat the rarefied rooms that make you feel “out of this world – you haven’t heard of it, you don’t know the symptoms, your family hasn’t heard of them, you don’t understand how everything works.”
Slacker is looking to address all this with a platform of mobile apps, including its mobile app and website. These apps will integrate deeply into the product, with the startup focusing on integrating all of the available data into its database with an emphasis on integrating its sources into Slacker’s own database. The startup has a business model, which has two parts: the first, charging an annual fee for any requests, which is then used to help Slacker gain even more data on user behavior, as well as new services for its devices.
Meanwhile, Slacker is working with a number of established companies that already have a large scale of their own, and says it has recently partnered with companies that are a major player in the space, like the BBC, as well as a medical center. Slacker is also able to help you create your own personal network, the latter which is also used to create profiles for doctors and other professionals.
There’s a lot of data that can be gathered about the way you conduct your health, but what Slacker does is turn things into simple, easy experiences that people want to track. Plus, it tracks what you’re up to, so you can make sure you’ve been doing your best."
"A startup called Lutron is launching today at TechCrunch Disrupt SF looking for help and advice to small and medium-sized e-commerce sites.
Lutron co-founder Michael Zohar said one of his first companies was an e-reader, and a big part of the team worked on the app until the company reached a tipping point.
Zohar said when they got into the e-reader app, they realized there were many different kinds of books. The team started exploring every possible platform and product, and it

======== SAMPLE 1 ========

The more it learns about the behavior of these users, its better it can tailor its recommendations to you and deliver personalized personalized recommendations to others — the more it knows how to talk to you, what movies your taste in, which movies to like, etc.

So why the company is going all-in with a recommendation engine? Because it just might have the answer.
How do you think about Facebook Places?
Honestly, we think Places is a great way to reach audiences who’d never heard about us. It lets us reach people who might not have heard about us from our previous social campaigns, our website or Facebook pages. It gives our users the “social proof” they need to know that the things we’re working on aren’t just the things that other people are doing, too.
For people who don’t want to hear about what we do, we’re focused on helping them discover what’s new, so they don’t have to pay us a huge fee to follow our work. Our goal is for everyone to feel confident in who they trust with their recommendations.
We have three kinds of service: an on-demand service, a marketplace and a “paid” service. On-demand service offers the basic functionality of your favorite service, while marketplace-like services provide a “central dashboard” where you can browse and add (and remove) services. For people who want to buy an ”On-Demand” service they pay $79 per month and we take care of the other pieces.
On-Demand Service (or OT) is a very strong word. We think it means something. Not everybody is quite ready to live in a “real world” yet. So having the ability to choose your service is key — it will be the key to making your business work. If you don’t trust the recommendations, you may not have the interest of staying a customer for the next year or so.
On-Demand Services gives us what we need to do.
If my favorite restaurant or movie is on Netflix, I’ll trust it with what I say about it. I trust people who say, “I’d been to movies with similar content over the past few years and it was like my favorite movie from 2000.
We understand that this is not the final verdict — it could be different by how the individual reviews are written, and by the companies’ own standards. But it’s important to have a trusted recommendation service. We’ve made it much easier to add an “on-demand” service to an existing Netflix customer.
If you want to give people the ability to “take the day off” we get them. It’s all about the journey, even if they take the day off today. As you see in many cases with “Google Analytics for restaurants,” when you’re looking at something like Pandora or Evernote, it makes a lot of sense to start with a “buy” and move to “buy the data.”
This is how we think about our mission.
How does pricing work for us?
It’s a very transparent approach. We get a lot of requests. Our pricing ranges from what we charged last week to what we charged every week so hopefully the price per user goes down. There is some one week of free use with unlimited data so you don’t need to be an annual account to access their data.
What do people use for recommendations?
One of our users’ answers for this has been people with whom we’ve spoken but not necessarily wanted to work with. So they’re not going to use us for that.
For recommendations from your friends or family, who are they trust?
Their trust and the community they trust has very little to do with who they trust and what they like.
Are there any other types of companies where you think this approach is particularly successful?
For recommendations from brands, our technology is very different as the quality of recommendations they want to reach varies quite a bit. Some of our recommendations are very good while others are not as good as the data they’re gathering and understanding. So we’d like to stay focused on the quality of our recommendations, so as to help the brands we want to reach also reach their customers.
How do you use customers for recommendations?
Our approach is that we’re going a step further.
In the first few months we were pretty close to being 100% focused on the recommendations we’re generating as we go. But now we’re focused on every business. So we had a lot of interest from our partners last week, a lot of interest from those businesses.
So we’re very happy to be able to have our partnership now, to go out on

 chain in the country which could help boost the quality of life.
He would not say, though, how many of those were paying the premium to take the journey further. A spokesperson told me that, though there was a small number of them there were a few hundred others who weren’t.

He said that over the past few years Google has been working to develop a service to reduce the amount of time people have to take out their prescription pads and go visit their doctor’s office to see how they are feeling. The search giant is also testing out new delivery mechanisms for people to try out a doctor who takes the time and walks through their symptoms for others to try out the treatment.

While he has plenty of confidence that Google will eventually deliver on this promise, and more importantly, that this won’t take a single step. This will take a long time.
“I think we have the tools and the talent here on campus and the money is still on the way,” he said.
He believes that the future of personalized medicine, healthcare and care will come through better understanding of the individual — in essence, he believes that the best way to treat patients, at least with today’s technology, and not the more mechanical approach, is to understand the individual. The same can come from taking the right steps to improve a patient’s quality of life.
The key to all this, and what it really is about, are the clinical symptoms of patients. With all that, the only question, the team is left with is how to deliver the treatment.
With the current funding, the team plans to build one patient benefit program for people who aren’t happy with the current health system and a better option — a better option, an improvement.

Google’s approach is reminiscent of how Uber’s passenger service in India has built a better understanding of the needs of drivers, so, while Uber has expanded into other types of businesses, it’s still relatively unproven in the world of healthcare.
While there are many potential advantages for a service like this in the world of healthcare, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done, and there are still many barriers that need to be overcome. When you talk about curing cancer patients, it’s an important first step for me. It’s a difficult business to grow and there are all kinds of obstacles preventing you from doing it today.
But one thing is right, Google has created a way for all of us to get better care. That’s how I believe in it."
"When you add someone to your phone, you never know what will happen next.
When you add someone to your landline, you don’t know who will call and who will text; when you add someone to your social circle, you never know what is going on inside their circle; and so on. You don’t know when to expect something to blow up within them.
We have a solution for this, and we want to expand that service to mobile, as we’ve seen in the past with email.
With InboxOut, you can quickly and easily send an email, a SMS or a Facebook Message to a colleague or group of coworkers that contains an important communication, like a meeting time. When you get a push notification, you know when they’ve missed it, even if you don’t want to send a copy, you can just go forward. InboxOut lets you schedule meetings, for meetings, for meetings — everything you need to know.
When it comes to meeting scheduling, you can send an email directly from your phone or you can use InboxOut to get a more specific meeting. The email can also be marked, marked as unread automatically, then deleted and it’s very easy to bring that meeting to someone who doesn’t know you and you, and to be in touch with an important team member before those meetings get to you.
At the end of it, people get better, and the process is a lot faster than email at any time of the day.
If I am speaking in a post about planning for my business or my personal life, you know that I only want to share what happens when I’m satisfied with it. I am not always happy, because I have spent more time worrying about the person then figuring out how to handle it.
By setting up your first contact, you are empowering yourself to have communication with your business. It is up to the individual to get engaged and have a conversation.
InboxOut is designed to be flexible, allowing you to add or delete participants from your phone — yes, it’s like mail and email — and send an email or SMS to anyone who wants to attend a meeting with someone.
When you are done, you can set reminders for people who will email, call or text you

======== SAMPLE 1 ========

When he joined the company in 2008, it was part of a group called GroupOn that then was part of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and part of a new company that had a huge impact on the company.
Groupon changed in a big way and became part of a generation of startups, which is the biggest movement for early-stage companies. What happened next was not so much that they are the big losers, as they aren’t going to go away anytime soon.

There were a couple of things that set Groupon in a different place in the early days.
The First Wave of Retailers
The U.S. and Western Europe are the kind where many people went for the first internet shopping experiences, so Groupon was a natural path.
If a user went on the internet to find it cheaper or cheaper for the same cost, they got interested to Groupon. With Western Europeans and the U.S., Groupon worked closely with brick-and-mortar retail associations to offer deals and discounts through online partnerships, as Groupon was one of the first startups in the U.S. looking to reach a global audience.
The Second Wave
Groupon took off in the U.S. with its Groupon Market platform, which was basically “group purchasing” – the company would sell more products and a bundle of deals around them. Groups were created to help Groups to generate more interest on the platform, so the company saw Groups as a natural audience segment in the early days.
This new generation of consumer electronics startups like Android maker Samsung and device makers has been able to work in a similar way: It makes them attractive to consumers, but that doesn’t mean those consumers want to spend more on the phones or the Internet. This is why Android makers have been finding success by going after the same consumers as the Android platform.
These companies are not immune from the competition and need to improve their products and services, just like Groupon is not immune from the competition it has faced before it started Groupon Market. And as with all other Groupon points of sale systems, the company is now trying to bring more attention to its brand in order to attract new customers.
The Third Wave of Retailers
Although retail and retail still form a lot of the Groupon point of sale business, the company began shifting away from retailing in 2004. The third wave of retailers has been a lot more successful than the second wave, so Groupon has been trying to work on it again for the last half-decade. The new wave is about bringing people together – the retail and consumer products, so Groupon Market is the same for those who use it for shopping.
Groupon’s recent launch of its Point of Service products have shown interest among the younger users (19+, according to comScore), but the company still faces challenges, mainly that it doesn’t have the scale of its new generation of consumer electronics. As with most consumer electronics, they also tend to lose some functionality when you compare them.
Groupon is looking to make its own hardware, new experiences, new partners in place on its point-of-sale products, and continue to expand into other verticals, so it may end up looking like it has already decided it needs to be a hardware company, or a retail company. It is interesting to see how some companies are being perceived as hardware companies that are trying to build new products, and it may be the only way to survive in today’s environment.
Groupon Market is a long process that I’ve seen Groupon go through several iterations (from launch, through its recent acquisitions), so I’d bet that by next year or earlier 2014, we’ll be hearing about the company’s latest product, but I wouldn’t be more than skeptical: It’s going to be a lot like Groupon is about to become.
Groupon and Groupon Market are going head to head, it seems; now it is about making sure to go where the customers are going, where those customers are already using the company’s site and app, while keeping the company lean with a lot of R&D investment and some very clear financials."
"Apple is expanding its presence in China, specifically the country’s smart home space with the news today that it acquired smart home play (with patents, naturally).
The company is still working on the best smart home technology, but according to an SEC filing from the company obtained today, it’s acquiring smart home company smartThings for “approximately$300 million in cash and additional consideration for patents, technology and other intellectual property in relation to the use of the home’s built environment, and acquisition of the intellectual property (including patents, technology, designs, and functional forms).”
The acquisition makes for another intriguing development, which is one of the more “invisible” aspects to Apple�

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 fog for the iPad. The project is called Tidus, and it’s an app for reading the newspaper or magazines, and the idea is to use your phone’s GPS to locate the items being referenced in the article and then push that item from the mobile interface to see the associated ad. Then, as the user approaches the store to buy and pick up the items, the app will tell them that you can’t see the ads because the iPhone isn’t in the store and Tidus doesn’t have access to them.
The idea is a nifty way for users to buy the products they see featured in the store, but until now there hasn’t been an easy, direct way to buy the products as they appear in the displayed ad, at least with the kind of information that the newspaper industry typically provides. That’s where the new Tidus project comes in. Using the app, a consumer would look up products on TIDUS’ website, then be able to tap a button to install the app on their iPhone. They might also be able to use TIDUS to scan the items in question, or enter their mailing address or add their device to the store.
The mobile app is essentially a browser-based solution that uses the Bluetooth communication method that TIDUS uses, so that it understands the user’s location and has the app display the app in the store. From there it finds the products that the consumer is looking to buy using a search-engine method similar to Yelp, but where the consumer doesn’t have to look for the store to complete the transaction. They would tap the purchase icon to make the purchase and then tap the “buy” button to complete the transaction.
Tidus scans the item in question using proprietary algorithms to return the products that fit the consumer’s taste and interest, but the consumer should only have to tap the “Buy” option once the product is delivered. While it might be a better alternative than shopping on a store, Tidus is an interesting take on what can be done with location and the ability to interact with a store. If it works, Tidus could have big potential use cases in retail applications, where stores can serve ads that are targeted by location and people who happen to be visiting at specific locations.
One thing that is also interesting about Tidus is that it doesn’t require purchasing or using the app to complete the transaction. The consumers, in fact, never even have to do anything. They can just buy the product and the app displays all the pertinent coupons when the time is right to view the product in question. The system uses a variety of affiliate networks to do this automatically. Tidus can also work with brick-and-mortar stores or can work with grocery stores to deliver food to customers who pre-order through the app.
The app uses a fairly simple, drag-and-dragging interface to display the items. When the app is open, you tap on an item with a “Buy” button. On the product page, you tap on “See Product Details” and “Click Now.” From the menu, you can select the product description and photo from a variety of online retailers.
If you swipe your finger across Tidus’ screens, you can view your next purchase.
The app does a decent job at displaying all the items that others are buying. However, I’d like to see better, more visible ways to discover new product categories in the future. For example, maybe Tidus could add new categories to your phone’s home screen, showing you products that might not fit the consumer’s taste or that they have curated for you already. That is, if Tidus can adapt what categories are enabled in a way that doesn’t appear in the app, its best course of selling the products could be at the grocery store, or in other store locations.
Tidus has some nice early apps that have been around for the past couple of years — in fact, it was founded in April 2011, and released at SXSW in 2012. But its apps only came out in general release in 2012.
Update: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that Tidus was a hardware device; it’s a software product."
"In the age of the ubiquitous mobile app, the ability to track social media users in real-time has become one of the more important parts of the equation for businesses. But today, a newly launched iPhone application called ToutApp wants to turn that feature on its head, by enabling you to view how often these users are sharing or clicking through other businesses on your app. The app also displays their demographic details, so you can see who they are – age, location, gender, and gender info – and, just in case it’s

 always be the best way to do things. But for some people who are trying to start and run business, and really want to be in business, this might be the best place,” Bhatia said.
“That’s why most companies that want to have a big impact are going to need to create a community. You need to find a community, who’s a resource to start a business. But the way to do that and be that resource is to create a community within the company,” he said on the company’s blog.
Bhatia also announced a major client win today. He’ve recently been a contributor at Forbes, Bloomberg and is about to start writing a few columns for Fortune again. I’ve received a tip as to whether that’s a major client win, but I don’t think so — although there’s a number of sources I’m hoping that’s actually one for Forbes readers.
I asked Forbes CEO Tim Armstrong who the company was working with on what product strategy the company is developing. He told me that it will be more from social publishing partners. “Fellows are the best at what they do. But they are also some of the best people,” he said, adding that Forbes is working with a bunch of social media services — Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.
I also asked Bhatia about his ambitions to reach the Indian diaspora. His answer was “One of the great things is we have huge opportunity to grow the business to be bigger.”
“I think the Indian diaspora has gotten over the last couple of years, they’ve all got a lot of mobile phones and it’s easier for an individual on the other side,” he said. “You don’t really grow the business unless you reach the Indians. And I believe I am going to get over the whole Indian diaspora.”"
"Google has a new patent to share that may not be the most earth-shattering patent one might think of. For years, Google has had a patent on ways it can help companies like Google’s make Android devices better. Now, Google has patents on what else it might be able to do with those devices.
The new patent details a method for making mobile device sensors “accurate,” without just making a better device in the process. While some technology may have been able to detect a slight slant between an iPhone and a BlackBerry in the past, this is a new component that could potentially replace the phone for a variety of other OEMs and make for a whole line of devices.
Another patent in hand comes from Motorola. Motorola made a similar patent years and years ago, with what it is now officially calling the Moto G.
Moto Tech founder Dennis Crowley explained to his boss Mitch Kaporzak at the time of the deal, while some tech companies don’t make enough of a technology what it can do.
It may be hard to miss the nuances in the patent, at which point the details are explained in more detail. Mapping the future of mobile hardware is also part of Google’s bigger mission to make sure that the Google Glass is also a hardware platform with an ecosystem of apps on top of it.
To make this possible, Google will be entering into a long process of getting partners like Motorola to integrate the tech into their own handsets. It’s not clear when this will actually be announced officially, but, given Motorola’s interest in the technology, we’ll have to wait and see what happens."
"Amazon’s e-commerce business continues its slow but steady march across Europe and the U.S. — aided in part by its smartphone OS — into new territories. Today the company made its first acquisition since it’s re-shaped its business, hiring three people in Europe.
The company is expected to announce the hiring of three software-as-a-service (SaaS) developers in Paris, Berlin and Singapore — three positions open to anyone in Europe as part of its ambitions to grow from 60% marketshare down to 50% by the end of 2013.
The same goes for its R&D team in Austin, Dallas and Los Angeles.
The company says it has hired the people under €6.1 million ($7 million), and hopes to raise two rounds of financing in 2014.
“Amazon is dedicated to finding promising candidates that have great skill sets. These are why our hiring is so important – to strengthen our international marketplace and to increase our presence in the North American region,” Alex Chiu, Amazon’s VP of European, North America and Australia, said in a statement.
Amazon also says that it plans to invest in growth efforts in various international markets. These include hiring more people in France

 note is a new model, and it will be interesting to see whether Google can bring Google+ into other platforms and with other capabilities that Google currently offers there.
You can find the full statement from Facebook here."
"There are a few other places to browse Facebook in general, but I will mostly focus on the US, the only place this is on my phone. So Facebook here and here are the relevant bits for you to understand how they define and use the social network.
But in any case, let’s talk about a little thing called Twitter. Facebook acquired Twitter in 2007. In a way, the acquisition seemed similar to the acquisition of Quora, in that it allowed an “inventor” user to use their expertise to bring on a big company with a big problem to its core business. But Facebook has always maintained that its value is limited to providing a very simple social network that you go to regularly to get your news from.
It’s been interesting to watch the launch of the US Facebook, since it seems to be a much more effective solution for Facebook users. On Facebook, users don’t go the Facebook store, they go to the social network. And the acquisition of the Twitter account indicates that this is not your average Facebook purchase, you’re going outside a store if you are interested in something.
I think Facebook can afford to sell Twitter more than a new acquisition is worth. So the question is this:
1. How do you define the “new” in social?
We can call Facebook News Feed. It’s a curated feed, with the News Feed being Facebook, its Facebook Web app and Facebook.com and Facebook Home sites where the rest of the feed live. It’s basically a web version of Yelp reviews and Google Places. It allows you to use your Facebook identity (and your friends’) to share on Twitter so that the rest of your friends can click through, bookmark something you like, read your news feed, then get a page back without leaving any content behind.
On Facebook, you don’t go to Facebook to see what you already see, you just go to the social network, like you’d visit a web site. For many reasons, the social network is the one you go to when you do stuff like this.
2. How do you present a new News Feed?
Facebook makes changes, right? What’s the feed? What do you share it with users? What do you share posts from your home and third-party friends that you don’t follow? This is what I feel like Facebook should be doing. Facebook is a social network, but it’s also a social feed for things like Facebook messages. It’s a great place to discover anything you love. But sometimes, it just feels like the product can become just a social experience with no value to what you want to do with it.
3. What Facebook should be thinking about Facebook?
I know that Facebook is a social network, it’s something of a social network, but it’s also built a social platform where those things happen,” he said. “In a way, it’s become a ‘gather information, go to Facebook’s social discovery tools, and there is a little bit of information you like.” That is, people will share and you’ll probably see a bunch of links on a page that you’re not already on, but that you might not have liked, right? You’ll have to click through and see it, but there are a few of reasons why I think there is no value to the experience.
What I do remember, when I first went on a trip, my mom asked me what I wanted to do. “Talk to mom?” It was a dumb answer and it turned out that I had no plan, but we had a wonderful experience together that I would not want to give up. But that also shows that there is no value right, just a bit of information. We know the future is in the News Feed, but it’s been a week.
So there you have it. We talk about Facebook News Feed here, Facebook, a new social network that makes my life less stressful and a big social network that makes me feel like everything I love that I spend time on — and I feel like I’m actually talking to it. But there’s no value to it for me. I should be reading posts on Facebook, looking for things that tell me what I want to do in a specific time, that I have to go visit and it’s like we went out there — we were never out there.
I feel like Facebook has been a good thing, and I have to look forward to the future. Is Facebook the company I want to be every day? It’s

 four, including a big move into its online fashion marketplace, and another one in March that would see it focus on delivering sorts of shoes, accessories and clothing exclusively in its online shop. For instance, it plans to add additional clothing lineups and fabrics around the U.S. and Canada in the near future.

The U.S. and Canada, where Kobo began this new apparel production. In March they began testing it in stores. They have since expanded their initial set of designs and partnerships with brands they expect to include in addition to more.
Kobo says they expect to ship over 1 million more items from 1,500 brands in the U.S. and Canada before the end of April. To date, nearly 200,000 transactions have been completed for some of the top fashion fashion e-commerce sites in the planet, including Vibebire, Fancy, Fancy and others, and some of their online deals are among the top 10 sellers in the UK, France and Italy, says Kobo.

The U.S. and Canada are the regions where Kobo’s e-commerce business has been based over the past few years, but the company is clearly stepping up its game in both countries now. These countries, combined with Europe, are its largest markets by sales, accounting for around half of the company’s total customer base.

They also represent a part of the U.S.-led strategy to expand its business. Today alone the company has paid for $1 billion in acquisitions of European startups, and it is also trying to help acquirers to move into new regions.
This is part of the company’s wider efforts to become a more global company.
In addition to helping launch its business in new markets, including parts of Africa, South America, South Asia and Southeast Asia, Kobo is attempting to expand via co-operation with its own partners on its e-commerce operations.
Specifically, the company is working with the French market to help expand its reach into e-commerce, for example with partnerships with Dafiti and France Telecom — two companies that are in the process of closing on an $8 billion investment, a much higher valuation than Kobo’s current $8 billion investment.
Earlier this week, Kobo and Naspers also announced an agreement to develop a partnership for Kobo’s virtual wallet service T-Mobile Pay and Kobo-branded smartphones and tablets. The partnership, which is expected to be formally announced this week, will see Naspers working with Kobo’s payments, payment and banking partners to develop Kobo Wallet to roll out in the U.S., Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
In a statement earlier this evening, Naspers Global Managing Director Robert Bosworth added that the Naspers partnership with Kobo is the first of its kind with Kobo — although the news is ambiguous on how this partnership is being developed further."
"The UK-based online ad company Millennial Media has raised a new $60 million (£44 million) round of financing.
This round includes a new stake led by global investment Gartner, along with existing investors Balderton Capital and Dell Technologies. Led by global investment company Gartner, a former VC in the U.S., the company’s previous raised investments also included $44 million in 2010 for mobile content and $39 million in 2011 for online advertising.
The investment in Millennial comes nearly months after Millennial announced its $23.6 million series C round, also led by Gartner, along with a $30 million Series D led by Gartner.
Founded in 2010, Millennial says it plans to invest the new funds in growing the publisher network, expansion in its catalogue of advertiser and publisher partnerships, R&D and product development. There’s no word yet on how its revenue will be calculated. But while the company previously invested in a number of other companies in the online advertising space — including Ad1 and Datalogix, plus other online ad companies such as AdPair (acquired by Google) and Admeld (acquired into Millennial later this year for over $80 million), its investor interest in Millennial is notable.
“We’re excited to join the Millennial family. For years, we have supported online advertising across this market where we believe that there is still an untapped opportunity. The market needs to be more transparent, and so we feel that adding this to our existing investment and our new funding, will accelerate this growth,” said Paul Adams, partner at Gartner, in a statement. “On behalf of Millennial Media, we’re pleased to be so honored to provide such valuable feedback to this incredible company and the

 efficient to see that they’ll work better,” he explains.
The app has an interface designed for viewing videos, with customizable playback options that allow you to choose the number of videos you want to view and the maximum length you’ll allow. These settings will also be available within a “watch list” section on the app, and can also be customized for each user. (I’m looking through my watch list and it’s not terribly helpful, though once you’ve decided on a length, it’s also relatively quick to know which video matches your liking and the new length and content options.)
“We wanted to take this information that’s out there, and simplify it,” says Schaak, when it comes to the new versions of the app. “We felt a lot of stuff was out there already and people weren’t thinking through it and coming to the right place when they should find out what actually happens in the world.”
The initial releases of Youtube and YouTube-native Video Player will only be available for iOS, not Android, however your phone has to have Bluetooth enabled, as the app requires it. (Note: It will support the device’s screen size – you can adjust the length of video playback on your device manually, it just takes a little bit of time to load). Youtube and YouTube-native players will remain free at the first launch of these apps, but will then be removed. In time, the service will get a more mobile-friendly layout and may include premium features like cloud storage.
When the app launches, it’s free. However, an in-app purchase that comes with a video player will come later, at which point a more paid service will be available within the app, with a price of $3.99/month (or $13.99 for the “premium” version).
This means no more users have to be concerned with installing their video players, which then need to be installed again each time you’re finished with a video, instead of just using the app each time you want to watch. Instead, this approach results in users completing the tasks quicker and, thus, more time with the video viewer in the first place. In total, this is a cost-saving way of the app, not merely a downside. It makes it better for everyone involved.
Youtube, originally created by brothers Ali Partovi and Hasan Aalibadi, first launched as an on-demand video platform. But its user interface was less than ideal, and the team realized there had to be a better way to view videos – not only in time to when you start watching, but to when you stop, too for another reason.
“What we realized was that we’d seen YouTube was all these massive, powerful things and yet not people were doing the work that get this done – the work of finding interesting videos to follow, of getting them to watch and listen to these interesting stuff.”
The Youtube app itself – for you can find it here — is a little reminiscent of other video platforms and, because of its layout, it’s somewhat smaller and less prominent than YouTube. (However, it does have the best search engine, too! If there’s something you want, you can press the “Watch Later” or “See Now” buttons to start watching the video later and then follow along to any of it later via the app. (Note: if YouTube is a watch list, you cannot see or “watch with” the app.)
On iOS: iOS 7.1 or later (appstore updates)
Youtube isn’t the first video platform, but it’s one of the early efforts from the mobile realm into the face of the rise of more mobile-focused platforms in the later days and the rise of native apps in the later days, and video sharing and watching habits are still growing.
Youtube is available for iOS, although it’s not entirely natively designed, it’s optimized for mobile devices with screen size ranging from 5 inches across to more powerful devices. The Youtube for iOS app is currently a free download here on iTunes."
"Google isn’t the only Android device to feel the squeeze of Apple’s iOS 7.5 developer beta. As an iOS 7 beta, iOS 7.x beta, and Android 3.4 Developer Preview are currently shipping the mobile software. (Of them, I’m in a particular group with a problem with iOS 7.x beta (the beta is not good enough!).”)
It’s not, but it’s an opportunity to make a case why you should go Android

 for the app, and we’ve found some folks working on finding ways to make that a better experience,” says Piron.
“We’re going to build things like ways to integrate more social networks, in-game features and more content features and features like the ability to sign into the app and interact a lot with users through things like social media,” Piron explains. “We want to build a platform where developers can bring in a lot of content and services around their own products, and that’s something that not only you have through traditional advertising, but you can create unique experiences through content.”
Tagged lets marketers identify what’s resonating with their audiences, and to track that on a per location basis. Today, that service works with two big brands, The New York Times and Time Warner Cable, and more on launch.
“There’s not a huge amount of data going around on the desktop, but when you look on mobile, it’s still quite massive,” says Piron. “You’re not able to go to an app like Google Analytics, look for people to rate a product…and not have that data back you would be getting a lot back. They don’t have the insight to be able to do that on mobile, but that’s where Tagged comes in.”
The company works with hundreds of large customers today, and Piron says that, after seeing the growth of Google’s ads in the last year, the goal is to be able to serve those businesses better through this solution. “We’re looking at the entire customer experience,” he says. “So when you think about it, we have a pretty huge opportunity.”
Tagged was founded in late 2010, and it’s now a team of six based in the North Bay area."
"Editor’s note: Alexia Tsotsis is an entrepreneur, publicist, and social media strategist. She has been a guest contributor to TechCrunch since July, and has now appeared on The New York Times’ page for the last time.
I’m the first of the world’s best-known, high-profile journalists to write about the world’s nascent startup scene — a world where an unprecedented number of global tech journalists are only now starting to see the fruits of their labor in a real sense.
Here’s what I wrote yesterday in a column posted with the title How New York Times Writers Are Improving America’s Startup Scene Without Breaking The Newsroom Block. In many ways, I’m referring to the fact that I cover nearly all the major U.S. news stories — from startup startups to cybersecurity scandals, from international policy to health cases, and even to stories I could have written myself. I’ve tried to stay away from things that would overwhelm all of the stories I cover, and what’s important to me is that I write about what’s important today, but also about the big picture and trends that matter to me.
My main gig as a writer has been on breaking news. There are many different ways of doing this, and each has its own set of benefits and challenges. I’ve covered several other publications’ content, but I don’t cover the general news of an entire day — I’d cover the world’s tech publications when I could — but as an outsider, I’m always thinking, “Man, I get a lot of this stuff today. I just can’t begrudge them for it, and I’m probably too many of it.” The NYT is so interested in writing critically of a growing and vibrant startup ecosystem, I wouldn’t want to write about all of them. I would cover the LA Times, the Times Magazine and even the Washington Times, and I would write about the biggest stories that matter to my personal experience at the moment — not the big stories covered by one of the smaller news organizations I cover, or by one of the national news organizations I cover for a living.
I’m interested in doing both these things, in trying to cover what matters to me the most, and covering the world’s smaller news organizations that I find interesting, and maybe that’s why I’m writing this column. I know that the headline here, which is a comment run on an article I posted on TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference, will bring some of the story ideas from these different types of news pieces into wider context.
I also know you can’t cover every aspect of the news industry by itself — this article, and the Times/NYT comments it will quote from its sources, is based on a source’s

ed app.
The service is still being tested when it arrives next month (though the service will be free).
But all signs suggest Android is growing its user base faster than Apple’s iPhone sales. Developers told us last month that iOS would take a 16 percent share of device sales overall, so you can see what a more diverse distribution of Android would mean for device growth.
For a service that’s supposed to be more open than the default mobile iOS operating system, developers would have a hard time embracing such diversity to remain relevant."
"There are plenty of startups that want to replace the fax machine. But the company that emerged as a true force in the mobile world is not only replacing faxes, it’s also bringing back the fax machine in a big way, with the arrival of a new service that lets you just print, mail and collect company-generated photos directly from the Internet.
Fintech has been the engine of one of the fastest-growing segments of the economy over the last decade. Today, there’s a growing economy built on a thriving black market where consumers turn to financial services to finance their lifestyles. While it took another decade to bring banking and lending systems into the global fold, it took ten years to bring a competitive bank into sight. It’s important though, companies still face pressure to keep costs low and maintain financial stability, but the same pressure exists today for companies seeking to grow. This is a trend driven at least as much by the growth of e-commerce, which has reduced the cost of acquiring and maintaining physical physical wallets and other stationary devices, as well as mobile phones, by bringing greater flexibility and choice to the consumer.
While fintech has brought many benefits to global economic efficiency thanks to its low credit card or ATM exposure, a handful of startups have begun to capitalize on this trend to improve and empower consumers.
Today, there are a growing number of mobile carriers, app developers and e-commerce companies that are harnessing mobile power for commerce and providing services. Among them, we’ve seen companies like Flipkart, Uber and Amazon tap into the trend toward a black economy for small businesses with the ability to accept cash and electronic payments directly from their customers through digital wallets.
Fintech has a lot of advantages for its users, and this is why I believe it’s so important to understand just how much value it holds for our businesses. As an organization headquartered in the U.S., we are already seeing companies using the global e-commerce economy to help build greater customer engagement that drives higher revenues — and therefore higher growth.
There is definitely growing interest among big companies to take mobile to the next level. As a part of our latest M&A activity, we’re also seeing a great number of startups moving away from desktop to mobile, including Square’s new app and the soon-to launch Shopee, another mobile payment startup, in February 2015.
We have also seen the emergence of many mobile companies that are doing all of the usual digital things, but in a cleaner and simpler way, without having to do large-scale data mining to extract valuable data. Among the latest to be seen are Airbnb, which started out as a B2B offering, before adding an international twist and bringing mobile photo services to the bottom line. Airbnb and Shopee are similar companies and both bring a similar kind of service and marketplace model to the enterprise, while others like Airbnb and Shopee are in many ways similar to how to create a market for renting out space to companies that are seeking accommodations for their staff.
There have been a lot of people who have been working to bring more innovation to consumer banking and financing services. Companies like Simple and Zesty, for example, do well in this space because they provide a more holistic, comprehensive and convenient approach to managing your finances.
But in general, we’re seeing a growing interest among financial giants like Visa to provide their cardholders not only with more innovation, but with an increasing number of people turning to the new-age payments startup to do that. Companies like Simple and Zesty help it because it helps scale payments in a more efficient and convenient way, while also providing a large-scale payment infrastructure that can handle massive amounts of money.
Another trend making waves is that there’s been an explosion of new mobility and consumer tech startups. Companies like Zumi, a SaaS and delivery startup started by the founders of Zipcar (acquired for $30 million in 2010, and later sold to Walmart in 2012), is one of the early leaders in this category.
Meanwhile, a handful of startups are getting increasingly excited about creating services that enable consumers to use their mobile phones for not only purchases and payments, but payments as well. Some of them, like GetMyEye (which is looking to go after a much wider audience) and Appzio, are trying to make payments as easy as buying goods on the fly.

 anxiety and the general climate for content creation with regards to the internet at large. With the rise of social media, and YouTube in particular, the ability to share information has grown in an exponential fashion, and users are more and more comfortable being more open to creating and sharing content than ever, with the same, if any, limits on what others can share, and a new generation of content that, in many ways, bypasses this.
The ability to share content across those social networks, as many of them now do, means that this new class of digital experiences have reached their potential to be much more than just the traditional social network. As Facebook has become a network and Twitter is a stream, a large portion of the content you use on LinkedIn and Twitter — the contents, the messages, the friends, it all all — are now available on an endless variety of places, while smaller groups are popping up everywhere around the web. It has become easier for us to create and connect the things that we want to share, with a few clicks, while our own social networks are making it a chore to add these disparate networks together into a coherent world. And we can share stuff that we may not otherwise find, without a whole network. We are now, in many ways, the post-sharing generation.
It all also means that we are beginning to look for different ways to share and distribute that content more openly than ever before, which is really exciting in itself. As Facebook continues to grow, this is simply starting to become apparent as well. Twitter, on the other hand, now comes to look and sound like an attempt to bring Twitter back to its earlier roots of being a real-time feed. And even Instagram, which has also had some big moments with Instagram re-sharing, is making that feel like over. Instagram may be the social network to bring us, but the old-timers on both networks like Twitter have become just another way to share our lives and communicate and share ideas. They can be the tools to do it, and not the tools to be found in Facebook’s more public stream on its own.
If you are interested in checking out the latest, try out Snapchat. A more public Snapchat stream could be more like a Twitter stream, I think.
It would be pretty awesome if the next generation of Facebook could be like Snapchat, but more of Facebook’s current user count and Facebook “active user base,” to use the company’s word, are more like Snapchat’s. Facebook might not have publicly said that it was working on a post-sharing feature, but it certainly has been working on integrating Snaps into the social network as a “hot word” amongst friends, which makes sense. Maybe that will start in a few weeks? Maybe not?"
"If you’re like me, you spend a lot of time editing videos of your TV screens, because television screen sharing has become as ubiquitous as Instagram filters. With Hulu and Netflix offering similar products, there’s an old saying: “How did this video get in front of a lot of people? Facebook’s News Feed algorithm.”
This is the sort of thing a video sharing startup can't help but see in the world. So it’s no surprise that today the team at mobile video sharing app Vine announces that Vine is introducing a brand new mobile experience dubbed Moments, that will arrive on the iOS and Android of the service’s platform.
For those of you who haven’t heard of it yet, Moments looks to combine photos, videos, and audio into one. So instead of just putting that content on the app’s Feed right where you can view it, you can tap into its Moments sidebar and tap on an interactive, pop-up window. The Moments sidebar reveals one app icon, the “Today, lastest” tab that is automatically sorted by lastest first. As you can imagine, users can choose on a different music like they would in Spotify.

You can play music or watch videos with your camera. It’s like “you can add more videos and share them with your followers,” as the founder of Vine put it. For the curious, you can’t go back to previous videos in this order, but if there’s a song on your radio that you’d like to watch just wait until the moment begins.
I got a quick demo of Moments in the app today. It feels light, simple and well designed. Unlike a video sharing app, the app doesn’t offer many options; there’s no way to delete videos from your timelines or remove the ones that you’ve followed. To me, Moments feels more like Snapchat’s ‘Like’ buttons than on Instagram, for instance. If you want to delete your photos as quickly as possible, you have it within the app instead of a separate timeline for

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 news users, the new “Live Stories” feature will provide live video and video feeds directly to your iOS phone’s camera, allowing you to broadcast to the crowd as you normally would, except that Live Stories will actually be appearing as live videos. Now you can share the broadcasts, and soon – potentially, the entire internet – thanks to the live stream feature. And to recap, Live Story broadcasts are free for any user, and are available on-demand and for your users only.
The new feature on its face, Live Stories will be live video. In addition, as of today, Live Story hosts and broadcasters will be able to record content from their live feeds to this live feed which then will follow you around the world. In other words, you’ll be able to use your Live Story to share to your audience while you’re on other destinations, rather than just sharing your content live on TV or in the news media. Not that this will impact your daily viewing habits, of course. It’s all about finding compelling content to watch, right? And from what I hear, some of the content will be coming from around the world, and the live stream feature will mean that the news broadcasters are more focused on their content, rather than their users and the users who they create.
But most importantly? The new Live Story broadcasts can start playing on the new Apple TV. So, in other words, if you are like me, you can watch to the end of the first hour here on iCODE.
If the Live Story channel is a success, we haven’t heard anything about how it should be monetized. We have heard that a revenue-share could be in the range of 10-20 percent. But this is all hypothetical. The company also isn’t talking about specifics yet.
For now, you can enjoy Live Story, but there is no way to monetize that content as a consumer while it lasts or stay posted to the Live Story. While the company may try to turn a profit on Live Story broadcasts by selling the commercials, what it would do is create an incredible loyalty among its users.
Update, live stream is live here.
Update 2, we’ve reached out to Apple for more information on the company. The more info:

"Mobile security company AVG Technologies today made a move in its bid to beef up its coffers for emerging markets by hiring away two key people from mobile security giant AVG to help run its business: Ashvin Dhingra and Bharti C. Mohan.
Both past hires are intriguing because they are among a growing breed of tech-focused India-based entrepreneurs in Bangalore, who have set up an entire new business called AVG India, which will focus on the country’s burgeoning market for technology services, including gaming and other digital goods.
Dhingra, who joined Google in 2004 and is a former executive at Bebo, helped spearhead Google’s acquisition of Android device management platform KompBox last year, but he hasn’t held the number-crunching chair and was perhaps not the most innovative or notable choice as a candidate.
But both exits from mobile security are a bit of a sign of how India is becoming a key new battleground for tech companies with more mobile security efforts being ramped up all over the country.
There are only a half a dozen major mobile security offerings available globally, and AVG alone covers around 60% of them. Mobile analytics company Gartner found that in this category alone, India accounted for over half of the market, adding over two million new customers between 2014 and 2015 — in all, some 537 million people were exposed to malware on mobile devices last year.
“This is a new market that we are trying to tackle, and we will be successful in doing so,” said Dhingra in the AVG statement. “The company has always taken a unique position by providing tools, software and services that help brands leverage their mobile audience through a variety of security offerings.”
In a blog post on mobile security specialist AVG’s website, AVG India said the acquisition will mean it can better tackle a market that it hasn’t launched in so far. It noted that it has been “increasing financial resources and efforts” to pursue new markets like “India, China, Brazil and Thailand”, but did not say how its prestigious acquisition of AVG’s purchase of AVG Technologies will help. (Gottani confirmed last year that the purchase will definitely help it expand its footprint into emerging markets.)"

 the Android and the iPhone, it doesn’t go past just showing people who are nearby, and it does more. Plus, users can filter results based not only on how close the closest person can be to you (or can’t be close to you), but also on how quickly they respond to a request. There are also charts and graphs showing the most frequented areas in different cities by different demographics.

The site, which also has a Facebook app, has already managed to attract the attention of major brands, such as Adidas, Conde Nast, and the NY Times. It currently shows just 4 percent of its active users are in New York City, and while it isn’t necessarily a great or bad city, it’s a better indicator of where this data is coming from.
In time, the sites ability to offer up a more personalized experience could make it a useful complement for brands. It also gives them access to a lot more data, which could allow them to better customize their own experience and target different demographics.
Founded by two ex-Google and ex-VMF/VMware veterans, the two-person team, based in France, is backed by $1 million in seed funding.

"Lavabit, a social and privacy-focused mobile app aimed at helping friends and family members stay organized and stay in touch, has seen over 10 million downloads since opening for business in September 2011, according to Lavabit co-founder and CEO David Echter. This week’s Lavabit Conference saw Lavabit’s user base double, with 3.5 million users logging in, and another 1.5 million joining to the service in January. The company is also doubling its headcount.
Lavabit is making a smart move by opening the platform to third-party developers, allowing them to build interesting new applications with limited scope (while providing privacy controls). But the bigger plan is much bigger - Echter says that the service will soon serve some 300 million people globally. The goal, he explains, is to become ubiquitous as possible in order to help families stay in touch via mobile devices and apps.
The startup first began with an online journal to help parents keep track of their children’s activities while online. In September it added features to help parents protect their privacy. A couple of months ago, Lavabit launched the Lavabit Watch app. For now, the Watch is limited to use during the conference, Echter says. An Android release is planned for the next two weeks.
The idea for the team comes from Echter, a former Google Maps Fellow and veteran of the Google+ operations. But he’s now been lured away from Google due to what he views as an impending change in Google’s product vision.
“The problem is they want to offer the service for free to everyone, and it’s going to be really hard for them to do that,” he says. “The vision is they’re going to be making a big impact, they’ll have to work with lots of people, it’s going to be hard to keep them from becoming an essential part of Google’s products. But I’m willing to pay for my service because I’m confident that I’ll be part of that impact.”

Lavabit’s new product (an encrypted email service?) has a lot in common with Google’s new messaging service, Google Talk. Echter explains that Google Talk is about communication, not messaging, but also offers a full directory of contact contacts to correspond with.
In fact, he says Lavabit even shares similarities with a service like Tango, the real-time video chat app from Skype. “It’s a tool for group video chat,” he says. “It’s not as simple as email or the phone, but you can do it through a video chat…It’s like a browser. There is no reason we couldn’t take that technology and expand it into an experience for people on their phones – they already have a smartphone.”
Echter has been selling this idea to others. A recent project, called Lavabit for Google+, gives example of the service’s capabilities, showing everyone the different ways a person can stay in touch with others around him or her – whether that’s via email, voice calls, chats, calling devices, and even WiFi. And those phone calls, echter says, are just the early, and the plan for next year is to expand into the Google Talk space.
Echter expects that Lavabit will take the product into GoogleTalk in 2013, and he says that when it goes live there will be lots of competition, with Skype and Google+ Hang

, which I had thought would be a huge success; and we just don’t have enough devices to print the best VR experiences to show it as a consumer VR experience.
As a consumer I feel compelled to support this kind of product and I’ve been more than willing to shell out a whopping $99 for a pair of the stuff when they’re available to purchase online and to the people within Oculus and their stores."
"It’s a new Android update in all of us at Pocket, so this is the day we’re celebrating Android’s first major security update, and the update brings a whole lot of new things, including the ability to share voice calls over Wi-Fi, add videos to your device’s camera roll, and much more. And in the future, we’ll be bringing some more specific features along the way – we’ll have Android 4.4.3 updates to the site and the Android app soon.
As always, if you’re having trouble with a particular update, please open the app and wait. While we get lots of requests we just ask you to try. The app is also free, and we still suggest you try the updated version if you’re interested."
"As someone who used to play baseball in the 2000s, I was really impressed by the number of games he had played. I’m not the only one who thinks so, as a bunch of other developers have now realized, with an update today called Double Tap that lets you play your old-school (and baseball) games like Blue Moon, Black Hat, Red Hot, and others.
The update comes at an interesting time in the game business. With the launch of iOS 7, Apple is offering iPhone users a way to retroactively make up for lost in translation and thus, replay. This means that old-school games like Red Hot are now considered third-party apps and, when a user buys the game, they’re giving the game away for free. This could really open up the market for the platform to developers and publishers, making the experience much more akin to its original source material, rather than something the casual gamer is likely to enjoy.
At its core, Double Tap is a simple, easy-to-use way to play your old games, just as much as you can do with the new version of iOS. However, the game itself offers something that can be improved by the creators by adding (or adding) custom content to their existing titles. For example, you can now go back to your old Red Hot game and play it on a new iOS device.
You can also rewind your games to find older games where you got a chance to play the same way, and can then download the current version of Red Hot for iOS. And in the future, Double Tap could be expanded not only to its original game lineups, but to all of its games.

While you’re certainly not going to find Triple Tap as groundbreaking as other ways of tapping on the heads– like the aforementioned replay button on Red Hots, I haven’t seen it live — it may be one of many ways to do just that."
"I haven’t written about my own attempts to track food in a long time, but I’ve developed a set of recipes that can be used on a simple basis as a daily routine for those who have the occasional stomach burn or otherwise have trouble making healthy recipes, including recipes for a healthy salad, smoothies from smoothies from smoothie vending machines and even a simple protein bar.
These are some of the recipes I have in the storage cabinet for the sake of an interest, but I am also looking into other sources of entertainment. One of my favorite meals is the one below, which I call a “pizza.” A pizza is traditionally a pizza, but I’ve been cooking more and more lately.
I’ve just started making things and eating out, so I’m not in the know-all mode about what to try. My only concern with making a pizza is to have something that you can take and put to school in a dish and then leave to finish, and I like this recipe a lot.
If anything, please add it to my kitchen in the comments below.

Ingredients:
3/4 cup plain flour, 6 tablespoons of butter, salt and pepper.
4.5 teaspoons olive oil, plus your choice of cooking spray.
1/2 cup fresh basil leaves.
1/2 cup tomatoes, depending on how you lean your vegetables, including carrots or zucchini.
Preparation:
In a bowl, cover and let your ingredients, like a salad mix, boil on your chosen base of ingredients. Add more ingredients if you’d like, including any other ingredients you’d actually want to taste like the rest of your ingredients.

 and a mobile payment system — that we had worked toward with PayPal,” he said.
“We’re more focused on the mobile payments that we are doing.”<|endoftext|>There’s a lot of reasons that we think it’s interesting to do this. For example, we can integrate payments to content or advertising in other ways, like by creating a video that shows ads in the video, for example, and now we are doing the same for payments.
That is, we can use our knowledge and technology to improve the mobile payments experience in a number of different ways, like increasing interest and engagement that goes beyond what we may have seen in just the past, and that can have impact in more direct ways on the kind of consumer behavior. But that’s a long-term bet.
The most common reason we may be making a bet on the mobile payments space is because we see all the pieces of it coming together — it includes the marketplaces that we have today, ad networks, mobile payment networks, the network effect that we have today, and the mobile payments in our portfolio.
So, our interest comes from the ability to see how a bunch of these pieces come together to get a really high-level picture about how they fit together and how to bring this together.
That’s why we see all these pieces coming together at once, so there’s more than just mobile payments as we look at this for mobile payments. 
We also know that there is an incredible array of potential future monetization opportunities for mobile payments. We’ve invested in the entire process because of the opportunity it presents — not just in terms of what we make in mobile payments but in what we offer monetization tools for them, so those that make mobile payments are more effective in terms of what we’re working to provide for mobile app developers.
TC: How different brands might be approached, and which companies may be best-fit partners of yours — which brands are in, which brands are in the rest. That’s a good point, because it’s a different question than we may have in mind.
TC: What kind of technology are you deploying? You know which ad networks are working right now, and which ones it is hard for them to operate. How do you look at technology in a variety of directions now?
TC: In many ways, it’s hard to tell the difference between an ad network and an ad network. For an advertiser, that’s a distinction you’re not really familiar with. But for an advertiser it’s a very big difference, and is an advantage.
TC: Where does your technology come into play now? Can we expect this from Facebook?
TC: We look at mobile payments as the first piece that we’re building with the technology that we have now and how we use that technology to drive engagement. We’ve been in a pretty successful position today with our ad-based approach. We’ve been focused on the business model that we believe will be the right thing to do to make sure that customers continue to stay in the app.
TC: Can you address the fact that in some markets, many people use Facebook, not WhatsApp or other social networks?
TC: Yes, that is a good point. We’ve got a tremendous mobile advertising and monetization platform, and there are people who like to use Facebook to be able to interact with their friends, so the key is to continue to make it easy to make that work better in the app. That’s an incredibly powerful technology model that we’re rolling out.
TC: What you guys are working on? This is a market where you’ve got to make an investment and the app is not yet available and there’s lots of people who want to use that product. Which is the key? Tell us how you’re going to leverage these inefficiencies?
TC: One of the things that the team is working on is trying to move up the process of making the conversion from Facebook or other popular apps to mobile payments. That is, making the process a more secure and seamless one that allows people more control over where they pay and what kind of payments they take.
TC: You guys are talking about Facebook for sure so that makes sense. Let’s just use Facebook as an example, how important is it?
TC: For mobile payments and other consumer payments, one of the things we’re going all about is making the consumer happy at a moment of need, even though they may be on the fritz of the day or at a place or time that will bring them some additional value. That’s why we’re focusing on the product right now.
TC: So today you are not talking about monetization?
TC: Yes.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Commission. The FCC has been pursuing a proposal of its own that aims to make online video more accessible to consumers, which is still only partially moving this concept forward, and the technology, a bit more: The FCC, of course, will be reviewing its policy on net neutrality in the coming months, and what it decides on, of course, will have enormous implications for the business industry in general, including where it stands with all parties; the FCC is expected to roll out its proposals on June 30, the same month that it plans to vote on it.
As was the case at the FCC meeting, it has already begun to work in progress; it has been working to finalize a proposal for an Internet neutrality proposal, which first filed in the FCC in November 2013, and now has been formally approved. “It’s now getting a lot of scrutiny,” admits Commissioner Bob Wheeler in testimony, for a good reason: “I think people are realizing that the way things are done by the FCC today is not a good way, we’re going to work through that over the coming weeks. And by December, we won’t be without comments and debate. Now it’s our job to figure out how to proceed.”
And it’s not a small industry, either: The consumer broadband sector is projected to have revenues of $16.7 billion this year — the first time that it has been projected to grow since 1995. Of course, some may argue that the numbers are low, even declining. According to a new report for the FCC this week, the average subscription for broadband service in households was $4,000 in 2013, while a mobile broadband subscription — which, if you live in the continental United States, is what you usually do — is $12.00.
(It could have been a few other numbers, but all in all it shows that broadband is a significant and growing segment for consumers — not just the one being targeted by telecom giants themselves, but one that is also being targeted by many other U.S. companies to start with, including carrier Verizon, for starters, and is arguably also part of the same market. The report’s coauthor, Dan Levy (a partner at law firm DFJ, which is co-leading this case, it turns out, also believes in the broadband sector in general, which he says is one of the reasons for the lawsuit, he says.)
The most interesting part of the FCC’s work is how it’s been laying out its wireless broadband proposals so that broadband providers are effectively working together to put together a proposal to support net neutrality. Wheeler has been doing this already for a while, as previously announced, but this is the first time he’s been able to present it in detail in a meaningful way.
Wheeler has been working on it with his team and with a large lobbying organization representing broadband providers and companies like Verizon, which is lobbying for this, too. The idea here is that they want to be prepared to deal with these issues when the FCC does its review of its proposal — because they can only see how it would affect this particular device, of course.
And again: Wheeler says that if this were put into place tomorrow, wireless providers would be preparing to offer Wi-Fi free or paid connections to their customers.
Wheeler is referring to the notion that consumers today have to choose between the company’s choices — not only between Android or iOS, but between the variety of OSes, carriers that would have different APIs, and a whole load of different services for the company to decide in its judgment from a company like Apple. The idea here is that if Wheeler were able to work out all these possibilities in a proposal that all wireless providers were using in their applications — for example, he noted that if certain app store developers and others are going to opt for those third-party services, that would be the one place where you get their service on your phone. And that is in that case, Wheeler said, their customers are going to get more and more service on these third-party apps — or rather they’re going to use those third-party apps in general use.

He said today that his hope is that the FCC would look to look at this concept even further, because wireless companies could have a different way that they are going to get the benefits of this: They could have decided, for example, that they want to offer an additional service to their customers when they turn off the third-party service altogether, or maybe they just wanted to focus their efforts for them. The second would be in how they would choose to offer different service options to people.
The third would be in how they chose to implement this. Wheeler notes that when a company decides to eliminate the third-party service and go completely free for their users today, they’re not going to be able to do so with this bill because of what they can

 Insia, Germany’s Fitch, offers online furniture buying and services online. The company offers furniture and can buy it online for a flat fee compared to brick and mortar stores.
“With Fitch, anyone can own a piece of furniture online and we can guarantee delivery within 4 business days if the furniture is not available locally or for that matter in a store,” explains co-founder Andreas Holch Pohl.

 said Fitch co-founder Pohl will be joining Fitch’s board as part of the acquisition.
In addition to Fitch, Fitch’s investors include German VC venture capital firm DABG Capital."
"Twitter is launching its first product designed specifically for developers building apps for the desktop internet-connected TV devices – the app storefront now live on iTunes.com. Previously available, the iOS version has been well over the featured app in many areas, including most recently on the Apple Productivity and iBooks Appstore and Google Play.
The app-store offers a storefront where developers can list a variety of TV apps and TV shows (but not in a one-to-one relationship) at a glance, and then set up a price-listing via Amazon and Foursquare, for instance. Developers and owners of the Apple TV can use the app to buy or rent shows through the storefront, then also check out what’s in the store for those interested.
Twitter says that it will be launching in the U.S. in the near future.
The company, which today has over 8 million active mobile users in more than 200 countries, has a sizable audience. For example, in a survey we conducted earlier this year, we found that more than 40% of Twitter users own an Apple TV (over 40 million users), and around 40% of Twitter’s active mobile users in the U.S. own an Apple TV, totaling an audience of 60 million mobile users out of a worldwide iOS user base.
We’ve also heard that several developers are already using Twitter’s TV SDK to sell their app and stream content to users in their respective countries, with countries including Spain, Italy, France, Spain, Netherlands and Singapore. Twitter’s TV SDK was already in testing with those developers before today’s official launch."
"The folks at Fleep have created an iOS app that simplifies a lot of the existing banking apps out there, making them a lot easier to understand and more accessible.
That said, the app is definitely not “simple” by any means. For starters, it also works to integrate your bank account, including banking-related activities. To make this done in a simple way, you can tap the “add to bank” button in the iOS app to add the money in your app’s database. This is where the fun really comes in – you can browse the app’s library to find things like “the transaction history, budget calculations, and receipts” and then tap the “buy” button to buy them using just a tap. Fleep has a database of more than 9 million users, and the platform allows each of these users to connect financial accounts, including checks, and then buy through swipe, in a single iOS swipe.
One nifty feature is the ability to buy in-app from your phone. This will allow you to purchase content through your phone’s app, rather than having to type in a number or SMS from your phone. If that doesn’t sound appealing, because Fleep is very consumer friendly, you can set up automatic bill payment for those transactions. If the feature seems simple, but doesn’t make sense, you can choose to disable automatic bill payments – a feature that’s available in other apps like Soldsie.
“The current banking app ecosystem is a mess,” explains Fleep founder and CEO Kishorek Palowenbuck in an interview. “We’ve seen it go out through a very complex menu system from banks, and not very understandable user interface for the casual user.”
As Fleep is now working on building mobile apps for other platforms, it seems likely that other features will also make their way into the app. As for what is next, Fleep is not going into too much specifics about what new things it’ll be launching in the future, but we may still learn more about new monetization strategies and partnerships."

 can search Google or Bing for a new watch, for example.

That’s also useful because while apps like the Pebble watchface app are designed to help you capture photos or take video or take screenshots, they’re more work and more complex. That’s because smartphones require that you take photos in full resolution, which makes photos taken with poor quality blurry on your device. The new app, however, allows you to take and share pictures in a variety of ways, even if the image you’re shooting is worse than it’s intended to be.

When the app first launched, I noted that I’d had been eyeing the Pebble for a while now because of its price and feature set, but now that it’s sold via the Apple App Store it’s a device that gets more attention – both from existing Pebble owners who may have never opened the software, as well as new owners who may use it for research and development and get a better idea of how the Pebble works.
The new Google-owned app now has two categories for Android users. For those already using it, it contains a variety of cool functions, like the ability to view videos, audio messages and calendar events. The app itself works much like the app that Apple provided, too, you can’t see any ads (except on the app’s Android home screen) and everything is free. (The default free version requires Google ads for audio messages and calendar events, though, which means it will charge you per message delivered.)
The company says it will continue to create and support Android apps, as well.
T-Mobile users of the app can use the app for free for the time being, and then upgrade to a paid plan through in-app purchases made through the in-app store. The app is currently $0.99."
"When it comes to Android and Apple news, it’s almost exclusively on the Apple side. Yesterday, IDC forecasted that only 32.4 million smartphones would be shipped over the next five years. By 2017, that number will rise to 60 million, a rise from 26 million in 2012. In other news, just yesterday, the WSJ reported that Apple’s share price is now trading at down $7 in after-hours trading.
So, in any case, as with any news story with some interesting implications, I thought I’d bring some attention to the world’s largest smartphone maker. For those who don’t use the Google Reader mobile clients (because Google Reader, one of my all-time favs, never got a version 2.0 update), there are plenty of readers to turn to. On top of that, since its iOS 5 launch, Apple’s news reading app has been adding new features, like the ability to “read” texts aloud and answer “how do I make a hamburger?”
For instance, the feature “read to hear” — which is a feature from the newly-released version of Reading Rainbow, but not currently in use ­— is being made an on-camera feed so you can follow and comment on posts as well as post messages.
Plus, the company is introducing a new “read to me” option, which offers a sort-of “paper-like” experience, where one tap lets you swipe up or a– and you can also swipe down to reply directly to a post with text, photos, and videos (e.g. the same features that Android users have always had from the default web version of ReadDroid). It even promises that you can “read” a post through its embedded support page, which means that you can view links to text on your screen or at any time by simply typing in a Google URL.
But perhaps more interesting than the other features would seem like is the fact that the company is taking the ability to read to read literally from another app, which just happens to be Google Reader. That, of course, makes the new app for reading digital content all the more obvious and compelling, and it’s now the company’s turn to make a move into the space of native reader apps, where it will bring Reader Activity Logs Integration, for example, which gives you read receipts or access to advanced analytics that will help you better track your posts in realtime.
You may be asking yourself “wait, isn’t Google Reader a no-killer?” The service has been an appealing alternative for those who find it less compelling and less reliable than its more mainstream rivals, so I have to imagine Apple is hoping that all these new changes will help niggle out those that are not fans of Apple’s Reader service. We’ll take a look at today’s news announcements when the news really breaks, including its news reader app rollout, and

 Yakon and his associates.
Sergence, in English, is a new, but more efficient, type of fundraising. If someone wants to raise money, they go to Sift, a startup that allows them to do so (with Sift, you can actually get cash!). So Sift lets you make money to raise money that you’ve already raised from people. So you take the amount raised and put it into a savings account that can then be cashed out as money for the investments you’ve made during your life.
The other big idea here is the notion of “collaborative investing.” Sift allows investors to have a financial stake in companies that they get to work with on some level, whether it’s a team’s contribution to a company. On Sift, the investors have a financial stake, but Sift also makes them a larger shareholder in a company.
It’s an idea that may be a little of a shift for Sift, which previously gave founders the ability to get paid as well as pocket change. Sift, by contrast, only takes a 6 percent cut.
Of course we don’t have to be Sift investors. In the case of Tictoc, founders get a small stake in companies that they have invested in at some point in their previous lives. This makes Sift less like a typical Sift, and more like a larger stake, because Sift is not giving startups a guarantee. For Tictoc, Sift makes it easier to get them back in the future. Sift makes it easy to get funded again.
As for me personally, I have to work with people like this every day to raise money for my startup. And if you’re going to be an early-stage company, you need to have investors that take part in these types of fund-raising contests and contests. Sift gives you an avenue to get your seed funding.

"Today, Facebook-owned Instagram is announcing the integration of third-party app analytics for iPhone and Android.
We’ve covered this before…when Instagram first launched it, for example. Today, the integration of what Instagram calls “app profile analytics” is officially live in the Instagram iOS and Android apps, and Instagram only in web format.
When you click on an app’s “More” button in the iOS or Android app’s app menu, you’re taken to a very similar page as the one your iPhone or Android had already turned on previously.
But that also means you’re only following one app’s account, so you can’t follow or unfollow a third-party photographer, for example.
The integration will be automatically rolling out over the next few weeks for iOS and Android, Instagram says. (It’s not yet available for web.)

As for the web version, Instagram had long been working on its third-party app integration, with plans for Android and iOS last summer. For its part, it built its own app analytics engine, adding third-party app data for the first time earlier this year. And now that the app is hitting 1 billion users, it’s also launching a redesigned Instagram app with features aimed at helping developers improve Instagram sharing and conversion rates, and improving uploads, along with some new tools for better SEO.
Instagram’s also going to be introducing a new features, too. The company says that app publishers will be able to embed Instagram pages right into their own apps. This will allow Instagram to compete with Twitter’s Periscope, SnapChat and Facebook’s Instagram.
Instagram, of course, plans to monetize this feature set in a way that does not damage user trust. At least in the future. And it wants to build its audience on Facebook, so it will push it as a new feature that developers can add to their applications.
“Today we’re the first and only mobile applications that’s using mobile profile analytics to bring in additional monetization opportunities, like this engagement metric,” Instagram’s Alex Deibold tells me.
Instagram’s new features will launch at F8, where it hopes to showcase its growth in a new post. You can see the full list here (the current version is live in the US App Store) and here to see all the ways Instagram is improving.
Instagram’s Instagram App of the Day"
"Facebook is rolling out a new feature that might draw attention to its social media service for businesses — based on the fact that the service only lets companies that have a physical location show their Facebook page from a single location on a calendar view, rather than allowing customers

 cities that use a network to connect people, and you’ve seen this at the recent Moo.
Trey told the panel not to expect anything more in the way of an official company and to focus on the product and the new monetization opportunities, not just on the platform and the new platform.
All of this means we are entering a time when we’ve seen every kind of disruptive opportunity before in tech. You could argue that something like this can be a case of the industry finally opening up to the idea that the kind of disruption we’ve seen in the past is something that can translate into a business.
Trey concluded:
Well, the new startup space has certainly added a lot of entrepreneurs and investors. They are the new wave of early stage startups which are proving to be the next big thing, that’s pretty remarkable, I’d say of the next 100+ years it will be the next big thing."
"A group of former Facebook employees are now working on an innovative app called Whisper, which aims to give users an app for sharing a moment and privately discussing their opinions with other community members. The company, also headed up by ex-Facebooker and ex-TechCrunch writer Sam Biddle, is also announcing that it has closed $1.1 million in seed funding from a list of well-known angel investors, including Bobby Ghose, Jerry Yang, and David Lee, among others.
If you haven’t heard, the founders are Jason Goldman (CEO), Ilan Katz (CFO), and Chris Hadfield (Head of Product) recently launched a new startup called Clarity, which is still in the works and talks about a similar goal.
“While the idea of sharing is not a new one, this is an old one,” explained Hadfield. And many of today’s newer apps, like Vine, have failed. “We think Whisper is starting to take root because it’s the first messaging app that we think has the potential to be the next transformative communication platform that creates new ways to express ourselves in the real world,” he explained.
For one thing, Whisper allows users to post, not share, and it does so in a manner that is not only legal but also recognizes that anonymous sharing has historically been considered illegal. In other words, it lets users post about what they are doing, not what they are done,” added Goldman. “And also that Whisper is a real-time, real-time conversation app, not to post and consume content,” he stressed.
The app also allows you to set privacy controls to limit what you can post to others on the service, which could help maintain a certain degree of control in a post-social network environment when you have multiple connections as well as the ability to delete information if you choose.
There’s also the fact that Whisper comes pre-loaded on the phones of those who signed up to use it. After signing up, users are given an in-app profile with all the required features, social data, and messaging services like WhatsApp. The app can also be used on mobile as an in-app social network from those who don’t have a phone running a Facebook account.
That profile can then be used to start private chats, and after it launches a “workout” section that offers other tools which make working on the app even easier.
The app is going to launch early this year, and it will be released first on iOS and later on Android.
For background, Hadfield and Goldman met while working for Facebook in a sales role which lasted from 2011-2013. They have been collaborating together on the company’s core products, like Facebook Audience Network, the social network itself, and the Graph Search tools for collecting and comparing online data to build profiles or draw on memories.
They are also early employees again, having joined their existing company, working on the social discovery features that powers the mobile games that Facebook has popularized.
In addition to sharing views with other Facebook friends, Whisper lets you find your friends’ likes and interests by both liking and following a specific brand on the app. And because the messages can only be viewed by others within the app, that means you can’t offer advice on your own, but others can find and follow your own advice too if they are a more technical user.
And if you think others might use the app, you are also unlikely to be the first one to notice these messages due to the way they are hidden on the app’s private network.
“It is almost a technically hard procedure to send an email to every member within the app,” explained Hadfield. “But once

 and. The first part is a “gimmicky” feature whereby, while checking the price of a shirt, you can’t actually buy one. Rather, you’re forced to type in the word “shirts” and then move on to the next part where there’s no way to “unbuy” a new item. Only that item is actually bought.

The latter part of the app takes a swipe on the item to determine if you want it or not. It then displays you a list of all your “shoppable” sales, sorted by both fashion and location based on reviews from friends. A “Buy” option, in the case of fashion, is shown next to the item in question, and, if “Yes” and “No” are displayed, the item is confirmed.

It’s interesting that there’s really no way to buy clothing other than trying to wrestle a shirt, and it’s not even possible to delete clothing you’ve already put on. But there’s a button to remove the clothing you’ve already put on. And that button’s contextual—you can tap on other items for a list of related products, in turn, sorted by relevance to whatever you’re trying to purchase.
As someone who tends to be more minimalist than my own style, it’s a little disappointing that there isn’t more that makes this smart and contextual. Or that there isn’t anything more to indicate that you’re thinking about the right stuff but maybe not.

The clothing recommendations are particularly useful if you’re looking for an outfit in a particular department, or for a particular colour, and know from personal experience what works for the occasion in question.
It’s also a feature that Google Trends doesn’t have, so it’s a useful addition to the Android Wear platform.

The other big selling point for a smartwatch is battery life. Since Wear is a timed release, which means it has to run a fixed number of apps before it can be used, it’s refreshing to see the wearables smart enough to make this possible.
The app list includes five wearables, including one activity tracker, so you can see if each one has the necessary functions and is free during the day, or if any have more charges planned.
The availability of the smartwatch apps is dependent on each individual handset—Google has not put up a community site for developers to build these apps, although they do have an open source effort in the works. You can download the Android Wear app store here."
"As if there wasn’t room in the smartphone space for another phone-to-smart-home hub, LG is adding one to its product lineup today: The LG G Watch is an “Apple watch with an Android app.”
LG says the new app that will arrive first on Android Wear 2.0 watches, but it’s still not officially announced. The new app, built-in by the GSM-based ODM2 developer as well as by some unnamed OEMs, is designed to enable watch users to find and follow apps when they walk through their phone for more work and consumption and then download them into their watch. It also uses sensors — and a microphone — to enable notifications to sync to apps, says LG.
Google Now cards for the watch will be delivered by LG, too, thanks to ODM2. The app supports up to four apps at once, LG says, and it provides notifications, too. It sounds like some kind of combination of smartwatch management system that would integrate with the phone, or the ability to use apps on the watch to access the watch’s features.
LG tells me that other apps that will be supported at launch include Google’s Calendar, as well as Facebook Messenger, Google Now, Gmail and Twitter. The new watch comes in two colors, yellow and silver, with leather backing, and sport a very simple design. You can see more of the watch in action in the pictures included here."

 companies’ apps. The idea is to help businesses see the value of getting more data from these customers, while still incentivizing users to return to their apps.
“When you think about it, if we can bring this kind of data back out, and incentivize more, then the data will become more valuable for us,” he said. “One of the challenges for businesses is actually getting their data to the right place. The thing that’s holding the key for this is that they don’t know where it is.”
He added that there aren’t the most “clearly articulated guidelines” in place for how the program is going to work, but the company will look to make sure there are “robust, consistent” and standardized processes in place for how the program is operated internally. In the past, Facebook has run special programs to ensure that data doesn’t have an appeal to a single source, so that its users are treated in the same way as everyone else.
The Facebook Data-as-a-Service program was tested in Germany in 2013 through Facebook’s Small Businesses group and Facebook and Telefonica partnerships, though Zuckerberg didn’t get involved. The program is the first of several “Farms” that Zuck and his company are currently working on aimed at small businesses, and Zuckerberg was quick to note that the companies running it are also based in the U.S. — specifically Cambridge United Kingdom — not Germany. He was also eager to point out that it’s actually one of the U.S.’s top five players in the fintech space, and the people running it are “top scalers and professionals.”
“It’s the f**king industry that the f*cking-economy is in,” he said of the U.S. “It’s an important part of our ecosystem, obviously. We’re very proud of that. But it doesn’t work if the industry doesn’t know about it… The f*cking-economy is in for the long-term.”
Zuckerberg also mentioned several big companies in the conversation, such as Apple. Zuck was effusive in a way about Apple, which he said was one of the big successes out there because of “its strength in people. You can tell who is in that industry and there’s a lot of effort being put into the sector.” That, too, is a huge success for companies — the people. It’s the same thing for Apple. In some ways, this is more proof of how we can expect big business to become more data-driven all of the time.
“This is the first of many, many things. The data is doing something wonderful, it’s connecting people and it’s allowing people to build amazing things in this ecosystem,” Zuckerberg said. “This is going to be the way that data is used in the business world, and it’s going to be part of Apple’s business, too, and it’s not just going to be just about data.”"
"I’m starting to wonder whether Twitter will have enough traction in Europe to make acquisitions, after new rival WhatsApp raised a $19 million Series E round. The WSJ is reporting that WhatsApp is close to having a pre-IPO valuation of $40 billion ($16.9 billion) after having been valued earlier this year at $19 billion in a $15 billion valuation.
As we’ve noted, in the last quarter of the quarter, WhatsApp’s stock price has been in a free fall since last year, raising eyebrows even if this is an unsustainable trend. Facebook’s stock price crashed on a one-year basis last year — and it’s still trading at a discount on that one.
According to an internal memo from WhatsApp’s CFO, the company has been profitable for six years and made a point of not having advertising or monetization. This gives it a strong market position and a free time for the company to continue reinvesting in new ideas and growth.
But Twitter isn’t very happy with that.
The company has been under fire for several years, especially when it comes to monetization.
Last year it turned its monetization tactues offering users a promise to see how the company would monetize its service in the near-term. Given that it has millions of active users between the desktop and mobile devices, that promise seems more realistic than the number that the WSJ writes is now $8.5 billion.

"It was just yesterday that Microsoft launched its own Bing alternative, Bing For Microsoft, a service that competes against the likes of Yahoo, Facebook and other “pure-play,” social media websites. That’s well-funded, big time. But even with a solid user base on the market’s fast-growing mobile device, the Bing For Microsoft service is just a one-off. Today, I’m getting a review of Bing for Windows Phone, and it’s a pretty basic affair. The Bing For Windows Phone is easy to use, but it falls short on the social features that Bing For Windows Phone needs to become a more full-featured platform.
Bing For Windows Phone is a good first step, but Bing For WP lacks the power of its sister Bing For Windows Phone offering. It lacks the ability to upload, upload, rate, and mark items, for example. I’ve been playing with Bing For Windows Phone for a lot of months and it’s something that I never really needed. Bing for WP looks pretty boring to me. Bing For Windows Phone could have more options, but it’s limited to Bing and Bing for WP-users, not Bing users.
The service does everything right — from the free news reading app to Bing Maps to Bing News to Bing Shopping to Bing Drive to Bing Travel to Bing Apps to Bing Drive to Bing Drive, with more being added over time. And it takes a few moments getting there to be a little tedious. The interface is a little more complicated than I would think for newbies to use Bing For Windows Phone, and it’s not likely to keep me from getting to my next goal.
But, Bing For Windows Phone? Not bad at all. Bing knows where you want to come in the moment and what apps you want to use right away. Bing offers the ability to sync your phone contacts through Bing for Windows Phone that will be useful for frequent users of those new smartphones. It also has great control over settings, so people can control if a call or text isn’t answered within 30 seconds, and even if a Bing For Windows Phone client can be opened up without you having to open it. Plus, it makes sense to provide support for the basic Windows Phone features, even if you’re not a Bing user.
The service doesn’t seem to have a large userbase at this point, but should be able to attract about 10-15 million (assuming it doesn’t really screw up in its initial release) to its service over time. With around half that number of users, I’d bet that the company will add more social features, along with some basic navigation functionality. To make that happen, Bing is in touch to let me know when the feature has been implemented — I’m always on the lookout for the feature.
As for Bing For Desktop, if you’re wondering where the Bing For Windows desktop version comes from, Bing is short on that answer at this point:
But Bing For Desktop, a Windows Phone-based app that was first reported by AllThingsD earlier this year, isn’t ready for a launch any time soon. Bing For Desktop’s release is still on the chopping block for Bing “because we need to get that right,” a spokesperson told me. Instead, the company is planning to bring Bing Desktop to other platforms in the future. That is, the hope is that Google will eventually release its own web OS, whatever that might be, next.
For Bing Desktop, Bing launched the service in November of 2009, but then shut it down last month. I can’t wait to see what Bing can release next when it hits all those Windows Phone hands that are so keen on those apps. Bing will tell us when it’s ready for Bing desktop, though.
Microsoft recently acquired Yahoo, and since, Bing has become a much more vital part of the Windows Phone ecosystem and Bing Desktop is an awesome complement to its core capabilities.
Bing For Windows Phone? Let’s hope that over time, the company starts thinking outside the Windows Phone platform. Bing isn’t going to be the next big thing in the smartphone space, whether it’s in terms of social, location-based apps or services. But Microsoft has made Bing a part of its DNA for the past five years and we can be sure that the company looks

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 data is in its early days. With time we see more of a focus on more serious technology. The latest thing that it seems to do is add new capabilities and tools to make those real-time communication streams actually more efficient. 
The first feature in the new version of Jugn, called a “Direct Messenger” or “DM”, lets any user send a query without clicking to the web page where it is being sent. In other words, a direct message can be sent right from the application. Users will also be able to respond directly (in Jugn, via the comments in the thread) to a query or comment on it from within the application. (The user’s comment is then actually displayed as a “star” on the chat page, similar to the one Facebook currently uses for comments on its Messenger app.)
The DMs, DMs and DMs are all displayed in a single place, unlike a feed and newsfeed, where you may start in a public place and end up in a private one. The new DMs, in case you aren’t familiar with it, are basically Facebook-style conversations where users have to comment on things that may or may not be public. (The ones that are public start on the News Feed and end at the bottom of your Jugn status sheet here.)
On top of this, Jugn also now lets admins send messages to users. Users can also now post comments to the chat that you can see. 
Jugn appears to also have gotten a redesign. The company says it was just re-designed, with a clean and organized look and new features like themes and the ability to upload pictures. It was designed by an outside team of designers, with the company offering the design work with its own logo that features “Pricery Eyes” and “I’m on the Rise.””"
"Facebook continues to work on and out its new mobile app, mobile web, and web and app experience with the aim of being able to provide that experience on mobile phones and across devices. This week, the company announced that they were adding the ability to create and share custom images and GIFs in Messenger to its iOS app, as well as launching a new Web viewer product that’s the first product of their mobile platform play.
While this means building out the native SDK for third-party applications, it also means expanding Facebook’s own experience, which has largely been limited to desktop web and desktop apps. With the new app, users are able to upload and share GIFs directly to Facebook from any third-party app installed as a native app from the app’s store, which allows them to tap through the app’s built-in photo-editing and GIF maker to let Facebook do the editing work for their own. (The GIF maker, Jink, recently added the ability to also add GIF images to the web, though this will require a web browser plugin to work.)
The new app launches this week on iOS on both iPhone and iPad, with an Android launch on the coming iOS 9 app.
While the GIF maker is the first step on the way to building a web-based version of any functionality or website on the Web with the Facebook SDK, this will still be a few years away since the current app launches with the ability to import, share and share GIFs, a new Timeline experience, a more mobile-friendly design, and mobile Web reader and Twitter client.
“If Web development is what it was when we brought the first HTML to mobile back in the fall of 2007, then Android will come along a few years from now,” said Facebook’s VP Of Platform Engineering Mark Zuckerberg.
“This should actually help increase adoption,” Zuckerberg continued.
Facebook previously offered an HTML editor tool that made custom HTML-based responsive design the default design for mobile, and the HTML editor tool offered mobile developers a “shortcut for fast and basic HTML web” and a way to start with basic HTML and let the web author allow changes that don’t render things’ own, and the ability to choose the layout they prefer.
This HTML editor tool was available in its own app to let users access it from anywhere they had access to the network.
“It’s really difficult to actually see,” Zuckerberg said when asked if this was what he felt was a “good”, or “bad thing.” Then again, in the event users can’t go in the store to make their own custom app right now, I suppose they’re likely to come back in a few years, making their first custom app likely a long-term project of their own, just like the mobile web now.
For all the talk of Facebook’s mobile platform play, here’s at

s its own blog today.
With two new employees, Head of Product will be Nick Bocan of the same name, which I’d assume he was named CTO at Magix Media. This is actually the first time that a media company has hired an independent contractor to manage its social media strategy within an organization.
This move follows a slew of other initiatives on the part of the company, including Project Lightning (which has since been acquired by AOL); Amplify (now merged into Amplify.com) and Sharelight. According to its latest report, the company is now seeing a cumulative total of 100 million social shares every month from its social media partners.
It’s unclear which projects are now coming on board, but I suggest that we keep tabs, as they have a unique perspective on how social media works as a strategy process in both the social media agencies and brands it affects. They’re likely to be similar to the social media agencies that have now come in the crosshairs of the new Facebook and LinkedIn teams.
The new employees will join employees from the old. They all come from TNW, which has also been hiring people in social media for years — it’s an interesting time to watch those teams work together on social media at large."
"Tune, a mobile application that helps people monitor their home network access and privacy, is today expanding its reach by adding support for more international carriers like Telenor, Germany, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand – a move that sees the mobile services provider’s mobile offerings expand globally, in parallel with this new IP initiative from BT, too, which wants to offer more choice for its subscribers across the world. It’s a big win for the app-based provider, now it doesn’t have to compete down payment, by adding many of those new mobile services into the mix for it.
The company’s home base is in Sweden, while BT’s business base in England and North America are largely retail investors. But the latter has raised some $10.5 million, including a $5 million investment led by Swedish venture capital firm, Atlas Venture, in May this year, but that’s not the only fund involved in that round. Nokia Growth Partners paid $4 billion for a 25% stake in BT, and Swedish retail giant Hometreks also backed BT.
To add BT’s IP IP into the mix, TUNE also added Telenormine, a mobile data and TV network. That network provides services to some of the UK’s big tech firms, including Facebook and Spotify as well as Skype, and Telenor also offers a “free” service to its customers as part of its IP. BT’s Telenormine service is free for users with over 3G or 4G devices (and more likely the 2GB limit) but also offers more bandwidth if they’re willing to pay for it.
BT said that BT’s IP initiative “is the first of its kind” — for the carrier itself, at least, as it continues to expand its subscriber base in the UK, which is in stark contrast to the European average of just over 1BN.
BT claims an IP customer base of 200 million, with 80 percent of connections in the last six months coming from overseas.
TUNE also notes that the new Telenor app has been downloaded in the five months since launch – it claims the app solves most common use cases, including troubleshooting and customer support, in addition to helping customers plan their next trips.
The decision to partner with BT for the creation of the Telenori apps on Android was due to coincide with the launch of the Telenor apps over Android.
BT notes that it would have to wait for Telenor’s mobile network to be up and running on Android first to begin, so that it could then work with Telenor’s mobile network.
To date, the Telenori apps are live on the TUNE.com portal."
"Baidu has become the king of search in China in terms of usage. The company’s Android-based mobile browser is used by over 400 million users, and the Chinese Internet giant recently announced a $3.5 billion ($300 million) investment into the company’s business from an unnamed fund.
Though the company had previously hinted at an investment in search software giant Yihai in October 2011, details were undisclosed. With its $66 billion funding round, and its own mobile business, that brings total outside funding for Baidu to around $116.4 million.
While Baidu has grown quickly, it is now at

�It’s hard to measure progress against a fixed goal, and there’s a constant desire to scale faster and to take great strides toward achieving our goal.”

The startup doesn’t even share its basic payment system and store locations, which is a big deal because it means it can’t rely on traditional financial institutions to power its credit business as it scales. Instead, it uses Stripe and OpenCoin, which it can then use to process payments in the U.S. and Canada, as well as in markets like The Netherlands, Britain, Germany, and the U.K..
“It should never have taken the company more than five months to get to where it is today,” said Brian Norgard, Head of Marketing, Payleven, in a statement. “Without Stripe and the U.S. Bank we couldn’t have achieved our financial objectives.”
The other main differentiator between Payleven and other platforms is that Stripe makes all the necessary transfers and handles the actual payment. In the U.S., all the wire transfers go through Stripe’s servers.
“We’ve always been focused on the wire service, Stripe did more than 20X faster than our competitors,” said Norgard. “We saw that Stripe was the answer to the problem of international fraud and we decided to focus our attention on Stripe’s strengths.  As we heard stories from customers, they’d tell us, ‘Please stop sending my money to Stripe!’.”

Payleven isn’t the first startup to tackle the problem that banks aren’t actually going to invest in the startups trying to grow the business (and vice versa) to make their money back.
In the past, we’ve seen companies like PayPal and Venmo that have tried to ride the wave of interest in peer-to-peer payments, and fail or get bought. There’s also Ripple, which is still around, and has yet to deliver on its promise of being able to reliably charge a reasonable amount.
At this point, it wouldn’t be surprising if a big player stepped in to either offer a solution that had both scale and fraud prevention built-in. For example, Square and others have built out payments arms for businesses through its service, so it’s a huge area already covered by startups like Payleven on the front end, and banks like Barclays and HSBC through their various services for businesses.
Still, Saul Klein told me in an email that Square did not “need the money.” So not to worry about the potential for future disruption, or for the perception of change, he continued, “We’re not about to go there.”
But, given Payleven’s financial backing, it’s interesting that it’s focused on consumer use and not just Enterprise.
“We’re focused on consumer customers, but can’t do everything we want to. So we took the service to the U.S. market and launched it in five different countries,” he said. “And because we have access to a lot of servers, and we know how to use them… We started with a pilot here in New York but eventually expanded to all of the big markets where Stripe is not as popular.”
Payleven works with other services to process payments, including those that are already integrated using Stripe’s API. And it’s also experimenting with “OpenCoin” (the new, “Bitcoinized,” under the radar, alternative to Ripple), which it sees as long-term value for its services.
“It is difficult to compete with Ripple, because the underlying service is much better,” he said. “But we don’t have to focus on the end user, we focus on the enterprise.”
“The enterprise may be the hardest to get into in the short term, but we are focused on the end user. We’ve built out a very easy, standard platform that allows them to start accepting payments as soon as they want, and we also allow them to sell on a subscription basis,” he added. Payleven is working with the Department of Defense to power a campaign for a small group of soldiers in Afghanistan that uses its system to help with recruitment, Klein said.
“It’s much faster than competing with traditional financial institutions, because they have a full accounting system,” he said.
Payleven declined to offer details as to its investors, but it did say that it has a “multi-billion day revenue run rate

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
�On top of the app, you can also get ‘hundreds’ of photos to choose from, or set up a photo collage for “just” one photo. Plus, you can add a few filters to the mix, and then share it back to social networks.
All told, the app is pretty darned simple. But if there’s one drawback with its simple design, it’s that there’s zero built-in sharing, sharing, or sharing functionality. If the app shared anything back to Facebook, it would have gone to a spammy feed which you could never search for. And since the app’s sole purpose is sharing to friends, you’d find yourself asking the users to share their phone numbers to get things started.

That said, the app looks pretty damn good.
As for its new features, that came directly from the founders’ lives. Two are siblings who came up with the idea for the app after being introduced to photo sharing app Instagram.
In a blog post detailing the launch, the founders write about one of their favorite tricks for Instagram to send images back to friends. It’s a pretty common use of the most popular apps in the space, and one that’s actually quite clever. In this case, if you send a photo they haven’t seen, they’ll add a few more filters to take what you’re sending with the app.
“When the time is right…to send photos back to the person you want, that’s exactly what we do,” explains Coppel. “By giving you the option to include a small camera button on top of the share button, it means nothing but tapping one of the largest emoticons to send those same photos back from your Messages to someone. Or, as you tap it, the “Add” button appears with a “�” logo for the recipient.
Of course, the trick is to make photo sharing super simple. That’s something that will be easy for Snapchat, given its massive user base in the US and it’s easy to build the feature into the app’s interface, says Coppel.
“It should be clear from the outset that when you tap the “Send” button, you are prompted to enter the person’s #username. We know this helps speed up the process because you don’t click the “Send” button at all because the button can be found by anyone in the app,” he says. “We’ve tried to take a few different approaches. For one, you can just tap the button!”
In terms of what’s next, the two have a number of other things in the works for the app…including, of course, a mobile application that lets you invite friends to the app. “We think a really cool thing that could help you build an amazing photo-sharing app with this,” Coppel adds.
For now, the app is live on the App Store."
"Google recently gave some updates to its Chrome browser (bug or feature), most notably around its new Flash element inside the content area, and the introduction of an app preview feature for Android apps.
The company says the previews are the flagship new additions coming this week in Chrome users on iPhone and in Android. More info is provided in the release notes for the new features supported, and specifically around support for both open-source and native programs.
While that feature may not help developers break out the limitations imposed by the Internet Explorer WebKit browser, and the previews do little to help developers break the wall, at least the previews are there if you are interested in trying to see how Chrome users behave with the new app preview features in the browser.
When the preview is enabled, users will be presented with new “app previews,” which are basically previews of mobile applications that support the new, faster version of the browser, which the developers can test and try at any time they want, according to the company.
Android previews have never been available in Android for users directly, in any version, according to Google.
Android previews are the most interesting new feature coming from Google, and are a first indication of what might come next. Google also said that its new app previews for web apps, which were recently added, will be included as well, as other new browser features including dynamic browsing for mobile browsing, and support for JavaScript updates. Google has also said that third-party apps, such as its mobile ads, have now also appear in Android devices.
Android previews are a first look at what’s being done around mobile, and if you want to learn more about what apps are available in the preview, the Google App preview portal can be found here."

 Previous year, they were all about apps. Now the focus is really squarely on those apps, and in many respects it is the same team.
The company believes that apps are for everyone. They are built for the masses. It’s the kind of apps that can be used by the masses. That’s why, despite all the trolls on the Internet, the company has managed to attract attention. It’s a product that appeals to a very specific audience.
It might not be the strangest idea, but there’s so much opposition to it in the general public eye, that over-enforcing it isn’t the most productive strategy to succeed. Not all the attention is getting entrenched in one particular direction.
It might be a more logical course of action to start with app-based, social networking and messaging.
In this field, Garrett Camp, Garrett and his team recently launched an app called Hootbook, the mobile messaging service for your iPhone, which lets you share short text messages with friends. The company has also developed its own messaging competitor called Hootie.com — essentially this is a mobile IM/IM messaging platform that’s tied together with the Hootbook mobile app in the same way Slack has.
The company has also launched apps like Hootay. This is a messaging tool that lets you share short audio/video messages, with your friends, for example. Not all messaging hacks are successful, but Garrett Camp believes that when successful things are easy to implement."
"Matching the trend of online education, MIT has been at its best, especially in its first few decades of service. But while it’s an enormous university with a long history and a trove of intellectual property, it’s had trouble raising funding.
After two decades of research and development, MIT’s traditional classroom-based learning management system, a legacy of which is still being replaced by a cloud-based software, has a bad reputation. Most schools have to pay a tuition fee to cover the cost of acquiring it.
But that costs, as a Harvard Business Review editor once famously said, is “getting out of hand.”
Now, MIT — and other schools — is trying to change that perception about the system, which could be the most important change since the 1960’s.
The Harvard Business Review reported this weekend that MIT is making a change to its coursework structure to “matching the new paradigm, coupled with increasing spending in areas such as computer science.”
The changes are already underway and have led to a reduction of the number of courses that are offered to first-generation MIT students. In other words, a reduction is now taking place that isn’t a direct result of the change.
“For undergraduates who are considering graduation and entering their fourth year of study, it is not as simple as just dropping a course, but rather a cumulative set of courses over time, said John Doerr, the dean, in the Harvard News Service announcement.
So the question is, when schools think the program is no longer relevant, or that it is, “in danger of losing relevance,” doerksen has said today.
The changes come as a number of schools are scrambling to replace their old learning systems with more data-driven ones.
The biggest school, University of Pennsylvania, is now rolling out a platform and the system management systems that will be being used by students this Fall has been called the Penn State SSPM.
Here are some of the announcements they’ve made as they transition forward:
The university is also rolling out a series of changes to their core curriculum for undergraduate students.
The overall trend is clear: Online learning needs to evolve.
The new system, developed and maintained by the University of Pennsylvania, will be a more collaborative platform on which students can collaborate and create real-time knowledge and tools. The new system will be interactive around the content being provided to students, they said.
The University of Penn also plans to increase the number of undergraduate students who take courses online. The goal is to make it easier for students to take courses and access the knowledge they receive.
University President John Doerr says the changes are necessary here.
“Technology has changed drastically over the past several decades, and we are all learning from it, but most students still feel stuck and can’t get across the gap,” he said. “In the same way the web has changed the way people learn, the latest and greatest forms of technology (and the next generation of startups) should change the way we teach about it. If a student has access to resources for networking, that will help, but it won’t be enough. With this new

 has a “great partner in Google,” with the company announcing a new Chrome extension that allows you to link your Gmail account with Google Drive via the Gmail Open-to-Facebook or Google Drive, so you don’t lose any of your data across all of these services.
“Google Drive is a unique platform for people who love their photos and content,” Google notes, “and we’ve spent the last year enhancing our functionality. With Google Drive’s high quality, ease of upload and transfer and Google Reader’s advanced search, new Chrome extensions provide many of the features that people expect in the browser, such as a built-in media browser and easy uploading of files to Facebook.” 
And that just about wraps.
Update: Google has changed its initial version of its post-Blink to reflect the new information. “We have been working on the new application,” Eric King, Google” on Google+.
We have reached out to Google and Twitter for comment, but at the top of our post you see our original post with that text."
"If you spend a decent amount of time watching football, you might have noticed that there’s nothing quite like a home run. And the stats don’t lie to that. Sure, it’s rare that anyone comes into a stadium in empty seats, but then, sometimes, the stadium can fill up in the middle of the action. Case in point.
We all know a fair number of sports bars and stadiums with seating capacity upwards of 80,000, so consider me a fair user. The experience of sitting in those empty seats is a wonderful one, and you’re unlikely to feel anything but comfortable at a seat where people you’ve never watched play a game but are glued to the tv. (I can assure you that the same feels, however.) So, when I see an empty stadium for a football game, my excitement isn’t all that bad.
First and foremost? That empty seat is the place.
Second? It’s a place that screams ‘I’m home!’ — and I can hear that, too!
Third? The game is on.
And here’s what is a football game in real life feels like in real life. (Sorry, Tivo.)
Last Week vs. Carolina Panthers (8-5): Kicked by Cam Newton (in the first quarter), Cam TDTD thrown for the winning touchdown. Cam scored his touchdown that was blocked by the Panthers’ kicker. 
This Week vs. Houston Texans (8-5): A few first-half fireworks shows, the first one of this kind for the Texans. The other game was an over-the-top commercial for the game, the second one was a game that was highlighted via social media. 
The opening score looks like a game that was already well-played, with the most impact from a couple high-flying fireworks:

"Today, Microsoft announced the Windows Phone version of Windows, and based on Microsoft’s Build.1 update, it promises to add a few of the features that were already present in Windows 8.1, like notifications, for example. And, more importantly, you can expect continued updates to the version coming with Build.1.1.
Today’s build of Windows 10 doesn’t just offer the standard Windows features, but has several new features that you’ll probably want. Here are the new features.
As expected, the Build.1.1 update for Windows builds is pretty light. The full build should only bring minor fixes, but most of the changes are pretty minor. But the updated Photos app appears to be broken. For example, if you click the camera icon within Build.1, you just get a blank list with no photos. Notifications, however, are just being delayed at the moment. In Build.1, Microsoft has finally added support for notifications that will be disabled by later updates in Windows 10. When the Photos app updates, it will have a similar list of notifications that you can turn on and off.

If you’re not sure what to expect, feel free to play a game with the new Build.1 update that comes with today’s build, as we’ve managed to find some decent matches on this side.

And I don’t think Build.1

 every new platform into it, and then we can go to market and have some real customers with a great experience across mobile, web, online and desktop,” he said.
Mimosa noted that the new capital will be used to improve its core services like its API, which includes monitoring and recording. The company provides analytics to identify trends and individual accounts, and this service also will start to become available in the next version of its platform.
“On a technical level, what this fund will provide us, is we’ll give us access to a lot of more advanced stuff in frontend, and make it a lot easier on the business side to manage,” he added.
Mimosa said that there are no definite plans to continue the relationship with Zuora and its customers following the acquisition. “In the first couple of months, we’ll see what happens with them. And we will continue to build on our new relationship with these guys,” he said.
He added that he plans to keep the Kinomi development team over there and will keep working on Kinomi while also making the trip back to Manila this week. Kinomi had 12 people with a $13 million Series A from previous investors."
"You’ll be glad.
In one week, Facebook will sell ads to pay mobile mobile app developers. The ads will run across iOS. Android. All mobile apps can buy ads thanks to a new partnership between mobile ads developer and ad exchange, ad exchange provider AdTrust. But first, let’s look into the rationale of ad exchanges before we forget.
It’s simple. It will be a good deal for app developers. They will know more money than ever before. And on top of that, there will be more revenue for apps.
Ad exchanges like adblock Plus make it possible for users to opt out from their apps. For example, adblock users receive ads through a blocking add-on. Adblock Plus blocks ads on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, except for Facebook. But because users don’t need to buy ads on ads exchange, they can use those ads elsewhere.
When a user decides to not follow up after seeing an ad, users will be alerted by the Adblock Plus or AdBlock Plus app. For those users who try to run ads through adblock Plus, the app’s settings allow them to disable ads on Facebook and Twitter. Even app developers don’t have to install add-ons on their apps.
If a user doesn’t enable ads for all apps, users will get more ads. Those ads will be for existing users that already have a lot of ads installed on their phones or the adblock Plus app, so it will be less effective than if users bought ads inside the App Center (the adblock Plus app).
This comes about the big issue for mobile app developers. Many of them could be selling ads to people who already have a lot of money and no longer need ads. And some of them could be paying for ads on the new ad exchanges instead of charging for the ads inside their apps.
For all of them, app developers will be able to earn more money without having to pay for the ads — the company will pay for Facebook ads separately for each app ad and the ads within the App Center. These ads cost between $2 and $25 when apps are integrated with the adblock Plus app. Adblock Plus app developers will get paid $5 for each million people who try to click on ads. The same will happen with AdBlock Plus.
For Facebook ad developers, it brings a new platform for app ads. Previously, users could find and install the AdBlock Plus mobile ad blocker on Apple’s App Store. But this was a really risky move. By bringing adblock Plus ad blocking to iOS apps. And for Facebook ad developers, it could become an easy way to turn users into loyal customers, increase revenue or acquire users. And that’s why Facebook ad developer lead-in-chief Spencer Rascoff is pushing the ads on iOS app in other Appcues and publishers.
As a reminder, ads on web are a bit different than on apps. I’m more likely to try a few ads before I download an app. But as soon as I try an ad, it should be able to detect that and make it work on a mobile browser.
Facebook ads use video to promote app-specific ads that can also be played directly within the app. For instance, a news app might showcase the latest score of an app. But if you see ads at the bottom of a game, you can install the ad blocking app to block them. Many app developers have signed up for AdBlock Plus to turn on their ads with a click.
By removing the ads, mobile app developers now get a new platform as well. I love this change. Because we can watch from anywhere

 improve experience with the product, the app will also support other parts of your life, including the world of pets.
For example, you could feed a gecko that keeps its own colony of pets happy and healthy, or feed an otter boy and boy’s wild gecko, as well as the gnomes of Otterscotch, with whom the gecko gets affection.
In the U.K., you could simply feed yourself gecko-shaped cookies, complete with real-life effects: a gecko’s cookie-shaped body will cause smiles and fondness, while an otter’s cookie-shaped body could cause terror and despair. To ensure your cookie-sized brains don’t get shuttered by all those sweet, sweet cookies, you could try the Chocolate Cookie Effect, which is actually just a more delicious version of the dark chocolate cookie.
You could eat even healthier or even more appetizing treats from the app, like the Egg Mosh or Milk Mosh. You could also browse through recipes to find a tasty treat for a birthday delivered to you by a professional gecko.
The gecko also has some cute little features, like a tail-tasting feature, where you could try to eat as many cookies as you wanted to make a point of doing a quick lap dance around a gecko’s back before passing it on.

If you find gecko collecting cute, you might be in luck. According to the developers, the app is very buggy right now, and the team is “working on a really good design for the interface that we hope to ship in the coming weeks.”
You’ll also be able to see who’s passing on a cookie with an accompanying message, and you’ll get the chance to see for yourself who has the highest level of love and affection as well.
According to the description provided by gecko, it’s possible for the gecko to take on an additional role as the most loving person on the planet.
“The best people in the world aren’t always happy all of the time,” said co-founder Matthew Pittes, who added that the app isn’t just for the “science geek.”
What’s more, gecko is a social play around a very natural interaction: the cookie-wielding lizards. Even if the app doesn’t have you addicted to cookies, you might still be curious to see the gecko eating them — if the science is even valid.
There’s nothing else about the gecko that sounds particularly appealing. If you just want a simple, cute gift for you to keep for the holidays, there are plenty of other sites you can buy. And of course, with the launch of iOS 9, it’s pretty obvious that the gecko’s world will only expand (or be expanded rapidly) when a version of the gecko launches on iOS devices first."
"It’s no secret that the smartphone space is becoming a crowded space. There’s plenty of excitement around the latest version of Apple’s mobile OS, iOS 9, and how it may influence other handset vendors. I wrote a lengthy post on Android and iOS 9 some time ago, and it’s become a hot topic among tech pundits (and even myself) if you listen to the iPhone 4S and 4C’s respective device forums.
As far as we can tell, the consensus is that the vast majority of Android OEMs have chosen to jump ship the lower-cost (and higher-specced) Android OEMs that shipped with Android 6.1 and up, the Moto G and Motorola’s Droid devices and the OnePlus One (among other high-end smartphones). That’s a disappointment since most of the high-end smartphone OEMs that shipped with Android 6.0 and up have proven extremely popular.
I’ve tried to get some of the same thoughts from both Android OEMs at MWC as well as from me on Google+. I’ll let a company speak for itself, but here are some other thoughts for those considering a third handset maker to jump ship.

While I expected much more than an event packed with smartphones with all the bells and whistles that ship with the new OS, I was a little disappointed. The press conference started off with a brief product demo, but the company has quickly moved into announcing other products, such as the Pebble smart watch.  The Apple Watch is a beautiful watch. It looks like a watch, but it can do things with a watch strap that aren’t traditional watches. It’s made it so very natural. I can see how the Apple Watch is making a statement about whether wearables are more important than a watch.

The Apple Watch has a lot that Apple hopes it will continue to implement when launch

 limited to make money from its social connections, but also to make money through in-app purchases like Facebook credits you would in many crowdfunding projects, so it’s not necessarily competing directly with its larger goal.
One place you may see the service go is to the business, as a way to encourage larger companies, which are dealing with data they have no control over. The company is initially targeting brands and media companies, so that’s where it’s setting itself a position for success, and I’m sure more likely it will expand to other types of businesses where it has an impact (it’s already live on Twitter, for example, I think).
This is not the first company it has picked up: it bought another company in the space, SocialBakers in January, and already has a handful of early backers for its platform: that includes an equity stake in SocialBakers as well.
On the business side of things, it’s not currently looking to charge revenue to publishers, but may in future — it does not share any numbers, but it does have a number of platform revenue-generating offers in its database, and it has also previously pitched itself as an enterprise-friendly initiative, a place where the idea of ‘creating a service’ could actually be ‘shared’.

Its founders are also being courted on a regular basis by other entrepreneurs. One of the company’s earliest hires was Andy Sells (a big, veteran at companies like Amazon, Twitter and Facebook, and also co-founder of Crowdtap) and another founding member (now at Socialbakers) is Kurt Flann, who has been working on ‘social CRM’ software for a startup project he spearheaded.
“We want to help people get rich, and hopefully more importantly, we want to help them stay healthy and get out of debt faster,” he told me earlier this month — and it’s not just the business model that might be interesting, it’s the community. “There’s so much that we want to do with our data, to be able to help everyone,” he says, and there are some other ideas that could be developed as the project moves forward that will be ideas that Flann and his collaborators for the next year.

“From a business point of view, we’ll see where it might make sense, and then see where we’d make money. But we can only do that with data, we can’t go out and make everything off of it,” he says.
Today we’re using the word “social”, he says. That’s not going away anytime soon.
Asked how Socialbakers stands out from the crowd in that regard, Flann says that there’s a big question mark. “In these social media marketplaces there are all of the social social players who can provide the data to help grow the business in those markets where people have low levels. There is no such place as Socialbakers. The companies with such a powerful data are the winners and if you can provide and make them useful for brands, that’s a competitive advantage versus providing with that data.”
Socialbakers works by building a ‘smart news reader’ — a word that sounds slightly outdated now, though many people like the old one. The social news reader can connect to publishers it’s also using a network of news aggregators — such as Google News. “We’re not going away, it’s going on like that and we’re looking at building more functionality,” he says.

It’s also talking about growing its use of data — not just the simple RSS reading, but also using “social graph” technology to detect events in publications, based on what has been shared on social networks.
“We’re using social datasets, things that publishers have shared through Socialbakers and we know that those articles will be popular as well,” Flann says. “We have a good understanding of what is popular in the network. The goal is to discover articles relevant to the audience.” And it doesn’t have all those articles on the network right now, so he says it’s “moving fast to find articles that are popular with the audience.”
Flann has also built up some data on different kinds of content: some of the publications that are trying out Socialbakers are more like Facebook News Feed — although the content can also vary. “We’re not trying to

 into an app store and, like Snapchat, you can send messages and emoji that users can tap to open those in a single tap.

The team’s early data backs up these early impressions. When asked about the business model, Ondyar said on a previous TechCrunch podcast that Pinger is working to develop an open web-based ad network — with the idea being to work with brands who create content and reach that users can tap into (as with Snapchat), but also to create new revenue streams. Pinger is already working with a number of major players, including Mercedes Benz, Tissot, Adidas, BMW and Volvo, he said.
Pinger does the same thing to make your Pinger interactions and interactions with you “more compelling”, as well, as you can now tap on a map within the app to reveal additional content around you — either a city, a time frame or an event (which you can select from those in the app).

The core of Pinger is that, once created, a user doesn’t have to create a Pinger again, so they can tap into this content wherever they like. On the other hand, the new app features an expanded history screen that lets you tap on any type of location and the ability to save locations for later use. There’s a huge array of content the company offers users, so the app has a large number of things that could help them find, save and recall the same things every day without having to think about something."
"If you’ve ever bought a used car, you’ve probably seen an ad promising to be “ready for you and your vehicle” within a few minutes. No, what’s really being taken away is the car from hell we had in our car the day we bought it and had to hold it up to inspectors.
If you know a seller that’s hoping you’ll go and buy their “ready for you” car, you may remember the bidding, the new order, the price, and the next day. Sometimes the price was right and sometimes it was wrong, which is why there’s often a sale or a “buy” button.
So what happens when a used car gets repaired? It usually involves salvaging parts, sorting by location, and arranging to get parts from various shops.
What if we offered a universal, off-the-shelf car that everyone could use? What if we could offer a universal, off-the-shelf car that we could install from our shops and install from our homes and stores?
A few years ago, a company called AutoBid set out to solve this same problem.
Fast forward to 2011 and AutoBid’s model of what’s inside the car is more than adequate. A year later, AutoBid raised $2.2M of seed to continue the work and now has over 500 customers and the system is live and working on a large scale.
However, AutoBid didn’t stop there, it began to expand out of its Mountain View base base of Mountain View to New York City, London’s Great Escape.
It wasn’t just a company that raised $2.2M, it also had a company vision and is planning to launch a series of automotive hardware products. Now the company is growing its business, but with additional capital, the goal is to move into the next phase of growth, the company says.
With the capital, AutoBid will move into new manufacturing facilities, ramp up manufacturing in California, and expand into larger sales. The company already has a large team spread across the U.S., but now it will spend a more time in a major automotive capital markets.
“We’re in negotiations with a couple of auto companies but the aim to launch products at the end of 2012 or in the fall of 2013 before we go out of business. We are talking with various companies in the automotive industry. We’re in the business of growing the business and continuing to grow the business across the U.S. and Europe,” Ben-David, AutoBid co-founder told Wired.
“We have plans to expand the business in the U.S. market. We’re looking to enter the European market with a series of automotive hardware products. We’re currently talking with a lot of automotive companies, but there’s a lot of things we are looking into, including larger equipment.”
AutoBid has a unique approach to car sales because it doesn’t have the traditional sales organization, distribution network and sales force. Instead, AutoBid customers pay a pre-paid monthly fee. The company builds its own car parts and sells with them.

 network, but it is now starting with the world’s largest startup-funded tech festival, TEDMED, in Boulder, Colorado.
A TEDMED spokeswoman declined to comment on the specific technology and startup funding details reported back by Re/code.
TEDMED — or TEDMED, as it is commonly referred to outside of the U.S. — is an ambitious global conference with over 300,000 global participants, the Huffington Post reported yesterday.
It kicks off on November 13th this year at TEDMED’s historic Redwood City Center, and the tech industry is expected to set out the next year, with a record $1 billion raised on stage before the end of that.
It’s more than music festivals, more than sports events and more than film festivals, but is still more of a “confession time” for the industry, as a few Silicon Valley companies have made their act bigger than their counterparts in other markets. Microsoft made its first acquisition — Skype — and now it’s only a matter of time before we see that companies will start looking to tap into the “Confession Times”.
“There’s a huge opportunity for startups to make a big impact,” says the TEDMED spokeswoman, in comments to Re/code. “The TEDMED event represents the TEDMOD model that we think really resonates. We have a real opportunity to make these worlds even more extraordinary.”
The organization has been working to make the TEDMOD conference an event for the past five-plus years, which is likely a success. The TEDMED conference has been a major annual (and sometimes legendary) event, with thousands of events, speakers, panels and more than 1,000 amazing aftershaves, and TEDMED’s goal to be a global destination, with more than 300,000 attendees last year.
TEDMED launched in 2008, and has now hosted the TED Global Forum, TEDMED Women, TEDMED Entrepreneurship, TEDMED Startup, TEDMED Kids, TEDMED Startup Battlefield and TEDMED Startup Alley. All the games, movies, games, TEDMED Virtual Reality, TEDMED Music, TEDMED TechCrunch, TEDMED TV, TEDMED Y Combinator and TEDMED Media were all part of the 2013 TEDMED festival. TEDMED has also raised a total of $24 million.
Since 2009, TEDMED (which TED also counts as part of the Global Forum) has hosted more than 70 global events, has hosted TEDMED Entrepreneurship Day, TEDMED Startup Battlefield, TEDMED CITTAUNCH and TEDMED FWD FOR SPORTS, among other things."
"A Facebook page with a video ad was recently posted by a teenaged girl who wanted to make sure her video ad got the attention of a certain boy she didn’t like: Her name was Alex.
The video ad was spotted in the ‘Friends of Alex’ Facebook fan group, and within 24 hours it had more than 300,000 likes, and she’d seen a lot of backlash for it coming from her on her FB profile, Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch last night.
The video ad shows a shirtless Alex getting his first real screen time, a quick and short-handed video describing “I don’t want to be a loser”, “I would love to have a friend to take care of,” and “I would love to be a regular friend” in other words, and it received more than 100,000 replies after being posted to the “Alex” group within five hours on Oct. 26.
Alex was one of the first FB groups to be formed and grew up on the social network, but after realizing there were better ways to generate revenue online in some other ways, she launched a group and started posting videos and photos about her life. But the posts were quickly buried in the “friends of Alex” group of Facebook fans, until Alex posted them to the viral video site, AlexLive, and then used the viral-ness to kick the video up a gear and then post another video as well.
While the exact identity of the girl who posted the first video differs between who she is and Alex, the video made her look like her, and perhaps her motives were less benevolent. The video has caused some backlash, and even has her message deleted, but the backlash is mostly being taken as a result of the viral image of the teenager.
To be clear, I posted and followed Alex’s post as a friend, but Alex explained she just wanted her to have some fun and some updates to her feed about her new life. You can watch her video here here, and as an avid runner user Alex knows the video was likely to be a lot of fun, and even if you don’t see Alex’s update as an ‘ad,' it’s been a fun one so

 anything but the price for a hardware upgrade depends on the model you’re thinking about, as well as on the hardware upgrade itself).
That means manufacturers who go above the $1 million price for a smartphone upgrade have more potential to sell devices as well–or buy a majority of new hardware for a second hand.
“One of the things you’re able to add on the cost, but it’s also really a strategic move,” says Zilmer. “It gives us access to an expanding audience that hasn’t been priced out of the market yet.”
The device upgrade process for a used model is pretty simple. Once the device upgrades, a new hardware upgrade will be posted on the online shop (at $449.00, in my experience). That sale is then paid off by the manufacturer in Apple’s cash reserve. (Apple does reserve, but it’s likely cheaper for the manufacturer to ship a new unit at the beginning of the process, says Zilmer).
That’s a nice price for a new device, but it still can’t beat the old one’s price, which includes warranty protection, new accessories, new batteries, and a new processor.
A new iPhone upgrade costs $450, and you’ll have to pay the difference.
The company, now headquartered in Menlo Park, started with a focus on the education market, because that’s what its CEO, Tim Hyers, wants his company to become. The site, he says, is now home for more than 35,000 schools and teachers, with 6 million unique visitors per month and an average order size of 2,000 per week, now averaging $1,200 – up 50% year-over-year.
The company has an interesting backstory, too.
When Hyers first joined Apple, it was a completely different company. It was far more focused on corporate education projects, like Apple’s Education platform, so it wasn’t until after Apple acquired Lynda.com that it became apparent that there was an emerging market for professional educational content.
While Hyers was originally in San Diego working at the company, it was the team’s idea that he was building a business that aimed to connect professionals with people with good skills that were willing to pay for the experience.
After dropping in school a few years ago, the now 31-year-old had left school and in his free time set up a small hardware business under the name “Edutopia.”

Now, Hyers says they’re selling hardware upgrades for their hardware upgrades, which range from $100 to $1,000, including apps, monitors, flashlights, tablet-sized computers, laptops and Chromebooks from the company’s resellers and distributors, as well as some custom builds of high-end smartphones from the company’s own stores and custom builds sold through the company’s website.
And they’re not the only ones. A slew of other businesses are also jumping on the consumerization wave, like Edmodo, Verint and others. The vast majority of them, for example, cater to a market that has, for many years, been dormant.
Edmodo.com is just the latest retailer to come online, but it’s not the only one. Others like Tooki, Bunktruck and a few others are also starting to come online to serve education customers — that’s not necessarily because they’re looking to sell accessories, but because they sell hardware upgrades.
While these sites, like the other more well-known forays (like Etsy and Amazon) are selling things online because of mobile phones, that mobile trend is only growing rapidly. According to a study by Accenture this year, the number of mobile internet devices is up nearly 50% over the last couple of years.

With a $60 million+ valuation, a strong team, and lots of possible growth, Edutopia looks like there might be plenty of room for another company that could potentially, right next to be an acquisition target over the next quarter. And at the end of the day, it doesn’t help the company stay in the good graces of Amazon and Google if it continues to offer hardware upgrades through an on-demand, crowdsourced model.
In the long run, we’re likely to see a slew of upgrade models under the Edutopia moniker, and companies are constantly updating their own, online stores with new gadgets that could be upgraded quickly, meaning that we could see new releases in the next few months.
Edutopia started with a team that had previous experience selling custom hardware, but, now that growth is

 including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram’s Discover feature as well as Facebook’s Connect and Twitter’s Follow button.
We’re not exactly sure how much Facebook spent on developing its own chatbot platform, but considering that the company has already launched its standalone messaging app FB@Home and Messenger for Android, it’s not too far along. Meanwhile, Twitter is working to develop its own personal assistant, and may even just launch one as well as an “app-only” version."
"In a world full of all things connected, the idea of attaching a “smart” device to your bicycle remains a bit difficult. A smart alarm with a little Bluetooth buzz? No problem – there are so many different alarm types! And you still just want to know how many of them you can take on the road?
It’s the latter two things that get a team together. It is a service to help keep a bike safe of note, but a few other smart riders have also decided to use its service of smart bikes to help find and protect their bike.
So the Y Combinator-backed company has closed a $3 million seed round of funding to develop its service and get it off the ground. The new funding will be put towards continuing developing their smart bike technology.
The Y Combinator-backed service launched last week with an initial target of bringing 1,000 bicycles off the runways.
The company’s CEO, Eric Mamedi, explained how the service aims to help riders to find the best use of their valuable, high-end smart bike — the best they can get is their current bike, but all that’s required are some light bulbs. 
Y Combinator, on the other hand, has taken the startup to the next phase of development with a new strategic investor. The new funding, Mamedi said, will be used by Y Combinator to launch its service and expand its service beyond the US.
While there are many other devices and services that can be equipped with “smart” technology used in tandem to save valuable time, or offer some degree of security, smart bikes are unique — given their relatively wide frame sizes and general utility — in that their makers aren’t relying on a smartphone to operate the app.
The key point at hand, then, is to add a connected hub that will let a cyclist’s smart bike find the best, most comfortable and most convenient riding position.
The service will be launched in the U.S. and Canada to promote its appeal and will allow bike owners to set their bikes up with the service and then get a real-time overview of where they are – and when they were last ridden.
You can check out more in this Y Combinator post, which begins with the fact of a new team, a pivot and a name change, which include the founders and the former CEO.
The company is currently in trial formation, but its first two batches are live in the wild. The second batch of 10,000 bikes are getting their first updates in June."
"If you were to design a drone with a team of robotic monkeys that were meant to help deliver food within the three months prior, you’d design a little hamlet with only a handful of cocoons in a narrow cage.
The Roomba, an upcoming product from Honeywell International, is designed to deliver cocoons in just 30 seconds. The cocoons are invented by a team of researchers for an educational project they have been working on for several years now.
The bird can be moved from its cave by adding a single line and swirled onto its wings with the aid of a swiveling hinge that is housed in the cave when the bird ducks under the protective cover.
Each Roomba “cocoon” is one square plastic-covered object that sits within the 3.3 meter high cage and has a circular face. The lid is a plastic one that fits under the bird’s breath and provides the feed on the inside that is supposed to allow the cocoon to swim.
The Cane Cage system allows Roombae to move their cocoons down a waterline. You can receive messages in real-time, which is more than most pil-fi robots can post.
The company is working on developing a new method of flying, a new mechanism that takes off and lands using a system of aerial acrobatics. The bird has no hands on, but there are more complex maneuvers that take advantage of their aeronautic maneuvering skills. The plan is to let the birds flutter down,

 confirmed in December, but it’s been a longer-term shift for the company. And it’s a sign that it’s not necessarily just about making acquisitions to bolster out its business, or more of an eye out for acquisitions to expand out of the consumer business.
In September, the company announced the acquisitions of local discovery app TinyReviews and Yelp for mobile areas the apps focused on selling more data to merchants in the U.S. At the time, Amazon’s Kindle hardware took a big hit, too — Amazon had to shut down one of its two apps for weeks, due to copyright violations. While Amazon has other prestigious tech attributes as part of the digital landscape, this was one of the biggest tech deals for the company.
Amazon says now that it will shut down the Kindle app in the United States and Canada on December 30."
"In the quest for the next big user data breakthrough, Foursquare is today bringing one of the biggest names in mobile data to bear the costs in Silicon Valley. Starting today, users in the U.S. and Canada will start seeing the Foursquare’s app appear in their phone’s native search results on both Android and Apple devices. Foursquare first launched in 2009 with their check-in app, but in 2011, the company swapped out its check-in leader, check-inscreen Developer, and launched what is now called the Foursquare Check-in.
Today’s news marks the first time that other users of the Foursquare app who also used the check-in app will also see the Foursquare check-in appearing in their native search results.
With developers getting a bigger cut of the Foursquare app’d pie, some of the big name players may have taken a hit. In June, We’d heard that Amazon was considering merging several big name apps into one, while Apple bought the app itself in June.
But Foursquare seems to have made a smart move in putting their developer platform out there, with the search engine as a way of getting around in such a competitive market.
As Foursquare’s CEO Dennis Crowley wrote today in the announcement, “This move gives all the existing partners the opportunity to earn a cut for partnering with Foursquare.”
Since the launch of Yelp, Foursquare has been working hard to differentiate the Foursquare app from other mobile Google and Apple apps.
For background, Foursquare claims that its users are twice as active of an app as those playing Big Fish 4 and Big Fish. And more importantly, the app sees some of its earliest users accessing the Foursquare in an App Store as the company mentions the App Store to note their growing user.
In the big picture, Foursquare’s move to become the leading app in mobile is a big win for developers.
In a world of big money, the Foursquare app still faces the challenge of gaining traction against all the other contenders. Last week, we wrote about how Google has its sights set on competing against Apple’s iOS, and how the App Store is getting even tougher on Android developers, especially in the wake of Google’s $35/1/1 mobile app install fee, which launched last month – and which, as of right now looks like it may be too prohibitive.
In Foursquare’s case, the app saw almost 400,000 installs on the Android Market last month, and this day, if anything, that number is going to top 1,000. The company declined to provide data on downloads, however.
Update: See the updated graph in action here.
Update 2: And we were told that we’re still getting our copy of the new app! The Android version is now out."
"We’ve now got the details, so we’re sure everyone’s going to be asking for money on this topic. Why should you care? Here’s the answer.
Google has decided to go all-in on artificial intelligence in partnership with Google DeepMind. Not just for the financial gain of DeepMind. Also because the search giant is an investor. So how does that make its machine learn? As DeepMind’s chief architect, Dr. Ian Chiu writes in the post, “our team is delighted with this partnership as we work on our next projects in bringing the world back to the basics.”
“This is an exciting start, both for the future of AI in this space and for our current projects on DeepMind’s AI team,” DeepMind’s Chief Scientist Dr. Mustafa Su

 that for some reason (1), Twitter is still in the business of building better tools for users, and so people can’t blame them. But I think some people have mistaken its change in strategy for lack of tools.
It’s difficult to fault users, though, even though they’re probably exaggerating when you look at the “I/O” fiasco on stage, where he seemed unable to think of anything he was complaining about.
But what does Twitter’s “brand” look like, now that its CEO was in one of the top trending topics on Twitter? Does Twitter lack any tools to help users?
Twitter, for all intents and purposes, has to have this app out there, or it’s going to go along with the rest. It’s a bit different than what most people think you need in terms of Twitter tools:
If you look at Google search for “How to make a successful business,” you will find the same type of lack of tools (just so you can know the whole time why you didn’t get an answer).
Google has a huge database of products to help it answer questions — Google+ being a prime example. Google has over a thousand social-influence products to choose from on its social network. The very reason Google won’t give up is the value. Google uses the knowledge and expertise of its global search, search and traffic to build its social footprint.
A small number of tech products provide some answers, but the rest of them are all Google, which has vast resources and will let Google be the answer-search for your questions (along with answers for your questions).
Twitter, meanwhile, is not using their social network as a content property — or rather, they are, and I’ve told them repeatedly. (Just take a look at what the Twitter account has been doing in the past.)

But it appears that Google is giving Twitter a chance to start moving out of the way people have been conditioned to trust search engines in solving the world’s problems.
You see this pattern here:
Some people have seen this type of approach in the past as it worked successfully for Google:
I personally believe that Google is trying to build a smart phone, which will have built-in Google products right out of the box:
Some will start to be frustrated, and some will take your company even further, like when Empire wrote his essay about the idea:
But Google has had other types of problems in the past: The Google Reader death spiral. Then it had the Google Wave disaster. Then its entire identity system, including Google+, is not as strong as it could be, as more users have become aware through many iterations of the experience.
And Google Reader’s popularity has declined.
It is possible Google will use its resources (read: the vast majority of its potential revenue stream) to make acquisitions or make more headway into social technologies — to build out an enterprise tool that can help the company to address and move the company out of its current consumer/tech roots.
It is possible.
It is certainly possible that Google will make a mistake, too. I’m not saying I’m saying that. People still use Google Reader as its place of access, or have the option to stop it.
But let us hope. And Google needs to be clear. We have yet to talk about Facebook or another of the web giants that has a chance of changing the world.
Google is on the wrong side of the screen.

"What does the word “hope” look like to you? It probably shouldn’t. I’ve certainly never been a “hope,” and the only thing I know is if there is a better one than, well, “hope.”
As it stands today’s Internet is saturated with content coming from hundreds of new sources. Twitter is in the middle of a huge growth spurt that’s putting many of that content online. So much of the content you’ve seen today comes from users themselves. So how does Twitter work?
What you are actually doing, the CEO of Twitter, is, using the platform to encourage people to be creative. People should see the real and authentic content flowing directly from the @ home page. This is a different way to think about media, you’re the one in charge of creating those images and videos.
I don’t think the content you see on your home page is the final product decision, as Twitter is a platform rather than a publishing company with content written by you, friends, and followers of your content. It is what you’re seeing right now, a mixture of good-looking and

 its mobile app, the iPhone has just gotten a little tougher to hack with. But Apple doesn’t. The way its mobile operating system is distributed to its developers is as important. It’s how Apple earns money, and it’s how the company makes the stuff they buy in the future or build for iOS.
Now developers on iOS 6 or above have a Mac app store in their local iTunes or Google Play store in a few weeks to sell apps, and we will see how that goes. Apple needs this kind of change, or else it will end up getting harder, and developers are going to try to avoid it, which means that Apple will have to force them to go back to what it had before. But even though the company is already in talks with some of those big mobile companies, there is no way to fix the problems for Apple developers, and there is no way to make Apple feel better about how it helps them.

"If you’ve ever wanted to visit Asia with your friends, you may be in luck today as Facebook is releasing a new Asia tour for its North American launch this week.
The company is taking five different trip experiences into account. The focus will be on a different geographic range from its core launch of Hawaii and Singapore to Cambodia and Myanmar.
“The goal of this post is to share our tips for the most fun adventure we’ve done,” said Facebook’s Asia Product Manager Matthew Boulassari in the blog post announcing the tour. “A trip across the Pacific is something that our team is really excited about. We’ve already been working on things that we thought were cool, and now we’re eager to share these tips with the world.”
The tour is also bringing new faces and faces of people, from a trip in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Hong Kong, Hong Kong to Taiwan, Hong Kong to Hawaii, and a new visit in Bangkok, Thailand with a friend in Manila. There are four types of trip: Thailand to Vietnam, Malaysia to Singapore, Hong Kong to Taiwan, and the Philippines.
The tour has been a good way of letting Facebook expand its brand to Southeast Asia. The company says 70 million people in the region travel to Asia every year. It has about 3 billion monthly visitors who’d visit Asian destinations of their choice. Facebook’s latest iteration of the Asian version of Facebook Places lets people search through its catalog to find things to do, whether it be restaurants, bars, shops, parks or hotels. The Asia test is already available in Hong Kong with one of our stores as described above, which is already rolling out in Manila.

The tour will open in the second half of 2014, and it wouldn’t be a big surprise if Facebook were to launch this new program within a few days to let users explore different destinations and other regions that we do not currently have."
"After the Facebook acquisition of video advertising technology company LiveRail earlier this month, Facebook is now applying its expertise in showing videos to video ad networks such as YouTube.
LiveRail‘s customers include brands like Nike and Taco Bell, and LiveRail told me it already has more in the works, such as the ability to show videos to Facebook Live or Facebook’s news feed. And the product should soon follow Facebook’s ad-targeting and social ad policies.
Facebook launched its social video ad network at F8 in April, and now it’s making the integration and the results that third-party publishers will see available for a YouTube partners program that helps companies manage their own videos on their website, as well as through Facebook’s mobile app and other channels.
LiveRail’s CEO Greg Winckie says his company has “no doubt” Facebook will launch YouTube Partner for ad hosting within “weeks,” though he admits it will take a while to deliver “a few more pieces.”

YouTube Partner announced at F8 that it could host LiveRail’s video, as well as videos created and embedded on YouTube.
The YouTube Partner program makes it a partner for all YouTube partners, which automatically ships videos to Facebook on their website, but this doesn’t make all content available to partner publishers. The only publishers seeing the partner program have their own publishers.

LiveRail was launched in 2011 and now employs people in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Arizona, Texas, Washington and the UK. It has a handful of other ad customers such as Macy’s, and brands like Nike, but none of its customers are required to use the service.
“We feel strongly that we are at a pretty good spot,” the CEO told me. He claims it was an easy way for Facebook to “move a social good from a product standpoint and make a social good on the ad product.”

 and so on. For example, when you’re looking at your calendar, you see everything from friends, to people you’ve talked to on Facebook. But, if it turns out you have a mutual friend in one of them, chances are, that person doesn’t exist in your calendar. That’s what Happti offers that allows you to discover people from those you don’t already know.
Meanwhile, while the Happti technology integrates with Facebook, so that you can say that you’re a “late arrival,” you can’t say that you were there “at the time we booked our hotel”. Instead, Happti will take advantage of the Facebook API that allows you to share your calendar with Facebook.
In other words, Happti knows this about you and your friends — and you can’t tell the Happti “if it’s already a week before we booked our hotel”, if not, but it gives you the chance to know who you are via Twitter. For example, if you go to Happti for a week, the iPhone app will tell you that someone you’re connected to through Facebook, for example, with whom you might actually be friends.
“We have a long list of people we don’t really know what they’re doing all the time,” explains Happti co-founder Daniel Chan. “In addition to helping friends, we can give them the opportunity to discover more.”
With the new version of Happti, you can now also tap the Happtti button on Twitter to bring your friend list, instead of being left in the blue “traveling” tab. In addition, as a result of the updated branding, Happti’s site is no longer only in English, but also includes the ability to add notes and share photo feeds (similar to Instagram’s sharing options).
In all, Happti is getting around 400,000 downloads, and has already been featured in the App Store in 140 languages. For a $14.99 download, Happti is not exactly a bargain, at the $3 for 500 invites included, as is always the case with pricier sites.
The iOS app is available for iPhone 1.0 and iPhone app, iOS 7 and iPhone 5. It’s a free download, but requires an Android install before the download will be completed."
"Another day, another acquisition for Facebook. Today, the social network is acqui-hiring social travel planner Gogobot. Facebook tells us the deal will help it better connect its users, and specifically to one-third of Gogobot’s global-speaking users: the U.S. “Since this time last year, there has been a lot of buzz around Gogobot because of Facebook’s involve, but the reality is that Gogobot was never a part of Facebook’s own product. This acqui-hire is a natural fit and will help Gogobot expand its product,” a company spokesperson says.
According to the Google Trends, Gogobot first launched in 2014 out of a $1.1 million seed round from Mark Cuban’s investment arm Cuban Ventures, Michael Birch and various angels including David Karp (founder of Path and Quora) and Brad Feld (VP of global brand at Gap Kids). Gogobot and Facebook are not disclosing who is taking their positions into the deal, exactly, though Mark Cuban himself is not expected to be taking any of his investment. In 2013, Gogobot had raised $7.3 million.
It’s not clear how much of Gogobot’s team is joining Facebook as part of today’s acqui-hire. That depends, as we say, on Gogobot’s business model — whether in the form of more features or more funding. Gogobot says its global footprint today is over 200,000, while its website has more than 30,000, which is not quite Gogobot’s full-hearted slogan for a ‘we got over 1,000’ — but it’s certainly not in the low hundreds of thousands of users either.
“Gogobot’s worldwide headquarters will remain in San Francisco,” says Ales Spetic, co-founder of Gogobot, in a blog post. “Gogobot will now be home and in our minds, and we will be keeping Gogobot as an independent community.”
Spetic also notes that, although Gogobot notes in a privacy statement that “the majority of users rely on this information being free

"When you want to learn more about what’s working today, there’s the Web. But how many of us can possibly possibly ever get there?
A quick Wikipedia search on “How-to” reveals plenty of great material, but there are plenty of places where you can find more of it. A great recent example is the blog GigaOm, which helps you narrow the topic search to things that are related to something that you own. (e.g. “doubles,” “twins,” etc.) You can also build up a social profile, follow people and build a library of topics that you’re interested in.
The two services mentioned are a testament to the fact that this is still a relatively new concept — the number of people who can access this sort of information is growing rapidly. But it’s coming fast: we’ve spoken with Google, Microsoft, IBM and other tech companies about the Web concept.
The Web, which connects a diverse collection of information around a particular topic, is also a good-hearing effort — the Web allows the human eye to see an endless stack. (And Google Hangouts gives you a way to chat about web related things.) But it’s also the fastest way of getting new people introduced to your idea or brand. A Google search on “how-to” brings up more than 1,000 results. A search on “how-to” brings up more than 4,000 results. A search on “how-to” brings up more than 1,000 results. That’s a lot more than a random web search, and you can see how it’s likely that a person will discover what you’re talking about and then ask about it.
The fact that it’s happening faster than we’ve known to expect is a testament to how well marketers are able to build a strong brand and keep it relevant over time. Google has continued to innovate around search, launching more search features this year that make sense together as a strategy. It’s also been working on ways of getting more business traction, turning them into products. One product that’s starting to make waves lately is an AdWords-based product at Google Compute Engine.
And to me, the most exciting part of the whole idea is how it’s slowly getting pushed online. You know, normal people do that too. Maybe. But that’s another story. Stay tuned for more from TechCrunch.

"When you think about an idea for something, you probably think about all sorts of ways to incorporate it into your life — whether it’s a business plan, an idea for a marketing campaign, or even an idea for a startup that’s just trying to make a living. If you just end up staring blankly at the blank, blank whiteboard as a blank whiteboard tutorial, you’ve spent so much time staring at your smartphone that you may as well be blind drunk at the moment.
That’s not exactly the kind of vision that gets us excited about something cool.
But the other thing is: “If this sounds like something anyone else is doing, it will make their life harder.”
That’s a bit more like a marketing agency pitch. “We’ve been working in the Internet & app development space for 15 years, with clients like Microsoft, KPMG, and RIM” and “we want to help you have a vision for how to create some amazing things with your life” — and then it shows.
It might not come as clear, but most startups get a marketing team. There’s the website, the blog, whatever you need to convince people who aren’t sure they need a product introduction. You know, to try.
I could also hear something from an entrepreneur that said: When you’re pitching a business to a skeptical or even mildly excited early adopters, how many of them can imagine the company coming out of the blue? A lot of startups struggle to explain their product vision or explain when, where, and how they’re building something.
A team of five to ten is enough.
That’s why we’ve seen an increasing number of companies trying to come up with the idea of how-to guides, or, in the case of the service Memphian, a guide that’s all about giving you a step-by-step, guided-by-consensus guide to how to make your idea happen.
Today, Memphian

, and if the company is going to make money, it has the ability to buy ads. The company says it has more than 8,000 users using its social media tools, including customers like Gap, Kia Motors and the Oakland A’s.
These features have proven to not be a big selling point for brands. Social media has been slow to take off, and while the new social media features may be fun to some, companies like Facebook and Twitter have their own best practices around how long they should stay in a single network.
The company has been running various studies on this new social media suite ahead of this acquisition to figure out which features are making sense in the larger context of social media. It’s also trying to identify other potential factors involved in the process.
“We have some ideas on how the user will become a consumer of their own social media platform, in terms of how they interact with brands and consumers,” Schoenbohm said. “The companies that we’re watching is what we like to call the “futurization” part of the business. It’s a real change in the brand in terms of the consumer. That’s what we’re trying to get out of social media.”"
"When you see a product you like, it’s natural to want to learn more about the company, the issues and what the problems might be. This can lead to a lot of wasted effort and a lot of wasted effort. That’s what happened to Brian Spaly, the founder and CEO of a new website called Blackout Sushi that is trying make a difference.
“As a former entrepreneur and an advisor to some of the biggest companies — the CEOs of Snapchat, Twitter, Airbnb, Airbnb and the like — I’ve been there,” he said. “One thing I learned early on is that this is something that a lot of people want to know. It’s something they really need to know.”
So he built Blackout Sushi to give people a chance to learn a little bit more about companies before they buy them — and let them buy into the company or enter the competition to make a purchase.
It’s free to use with a credit card and no transaction fees, but if a customer wants to explore further, they can always jump into the forums to talk about the company and try out all of their options. It also has the option of entering the competition for a little extra cash. The startup has already had a solid base of customers who have ranged from Fortune 500 companies down to local bars and restaurants.
Since launching five months ago, the website has garnered 25,000 page views, according to co-founder Michael Jones. You can see also check out some sample videos here to see what all of the fuss is about.
The company doesn’t have yet secured a $1.5 million Series A round. But it is raising a seed round, which means that it has a little more cash to spend."
"Social TV company SocialRadar just announced reports of a new round of $2.5 million.
The round was led by Fuse Capital, SocialRadar’s previous investors that had put in $750,000 in a round led by Rivet Ventures. Also participating were David Cancel, former President of global marketing for Verizon and former president of consumer brand sales for Disney.
SocialRadar launched in 2008, and according to the company’s blog, is one of the world’s largest social TV providers. In November, the company reached 13.5 million monthly unique users. It also serves more than 6 billion TVs globally.

CEO and Founder Michael Downing (pictured above) said: “With the rise of social media, people are increasingly looking beyond TV and channels to find information about businesses and organizations that matter. SocialRadar offers brands and businesses a way to share content with people across the web, social media and other social applications.”
In addition to helping consumers get more information about a brand, SocialRadar says it helps create content customized to a brand. For example, the company says that it can help the Virgin America TV show “#Work4Ever,” find the hotel where a movie was filmed and more.
It’s a big push for SocialRadar.com and its iPhone app. Downing said: “The brand is just a couple of years old, but we’re moving on from being a purely SMS-based, voice-based platform provider to one of the largest video networks on the Web and mobile.”

It’s probably the right move for SocialRadar as the company has always done well selling enterprise and media-focused services, which should help with the acquisition.
Downing added, “The most important thing for each of us, brands,

 discounts to be made in the cloud; and, it says, “it is possible to provide the same application for both Android and iOS at the same time.” Other benefits include the ability to use a standard battery, and reduced monthly costs since users only need to charge their phone twice per month.
As for the iOS version of the Android app, the company doesn’t plan anything yet on it.
“We plan to release Android apps soon and in the meantime we welcome our users to use our free unlimited service for the first time ever,” it says."
"After months of work and development, Flipboard today announced the ability to see tweets from other users. To get started with the new following system, you’ll be able to follow anyone who follows you on Twitter. That means that if you’ve followed someone on Twitter who hasn’t retweeted your tweet yet, you’ll be able to see theirs in a tweet without having to click over to a new feed.
With the ability to see tweets from outside accounts, users are now able to interact with Twitter from almost any web or mobile device. This not only makes it easier for users to interact with their accounts, but it also gives them the ability to do this in a unique way.
For example, let’s head of product for social networks, Jason Katz, announced today that in the past, you could retweet people sharing a piece of content from someone’s Twitter account but you could not click through the embedded tweet to anything other than Twitter’s own website. Today, you’ll be able to do things like retweet a tweet about an article from an online news magazine and then click through on the news website itself.
Users still would have to manually retweet the media if they wanted to see it in Flipboard. That added step could make the process faster. Previously on mobile, you were limited to the following column. Now you can tap on an image or link to see it in Flipboard.
While the retweeting option is a welcome addition, it’s still somewhat limited in terms of potential use. For example, today, I found the ability to choose to “accept” the retweet was more convenient.

There are a number of features that this could enable, such as the ability to quickly reply, block or report users. But for now, it’s a significant addition to the product.
For those who follow Mayer at the NYT, there’s a good chance you will be excited at the clickable link of the tweet. For example, you’ll see the link, and then be taken to the column of tweets. From there, you’ll then be able to click a new account or follow a person.
I have no doubt that this was an ability the team could implement with the new Twitter client on iOS. I’ve only been following Mayer for a few days, and it’s interesting to see how the team is building a product that allows you to share and retweet things.
In addition, there are now even more new features introduced in the redesigned product. It’s easier to create a new stream and share a link, and it’s easier to edit your profile once the link has been shared by multiple people. The whole interface has been overhauled, too.
Flipboard has also revamped its mobile experience as well. And, of course, there will be more integration features and more apps to come soon, too.
The company also today announced new revenue tools that will allow publishers to sell their content via third-party services. In theory, some publishers will make some money by selling Tweets and this could help boost engagement.
The flipboard team is also planning to release its first revenue generation feature within the app itself this week. This will be a new way for flipboard users to share articles (like this on The NYT’s website).
After the ability to see the links in your Stream, you’ll now be able to “Flipover” their article from another publication. You can do this by clicking on the linked news article and then clicking through to the publisher’s content.

The ability to view an “Open in…” dialog box within the app, and swipe your finger on links to articles in your Stream, is also new features coming later this week.
The feature is already live in the iOS version of the app, but it is not available in the desktop version at this time.
The update will be available for both iOS and Mac OS X soon, the company says, allowing for an ideal debut in December.
Flipboard today announced the launch of the most complete solution yet for keeping up with news and the social sharing buttons and

 In other words, when there is real interest in a particular location, you might get on Airbnb. But once there is a user on the other side of the world, it’s no longer relevant.
You know, and so you might be tempted to use Airbnb to rent rooms in a fancy hotel, rent rooms in a house in Dubai, rent rooms in a house in Napa, to rent out rooms in San Francisco, but you should probably start looking for more permanent rentals of more established properties.
That’s a fair point. The point of Airbnb is not about transient tourists renting out their rooms to the rest of us. It’s about people who want to feel comfortable on a long-term basis. The problem is all those tourists that stay temporarily in neighborhoods that are not usually home to them – like an apartment in New York City, but not forever.

The problem is that most leases are bought so that there is no uncertainty in the deal. And the more certain a property owner is about their market, the harder it is to sell a home. That, in some ways, lowers property values as house prices have traditionally risen.
In some ways, Airbnb is a market correction – if you can’t profit, it’s not a problem. And if you can’t profit, you might be tempted to think about staying as long as possible to make a living.
We’re on the cusp to become a service provider. But at this moment in time, that feeling seems to be fleeting.
Airbnb has created a tremendous platform that makes these transactions and the sharing experience that they bring even more comfortable. There are more than 300 million people on its books of potential guests who, so far, the company says. It’s still a long road, but Airbnb’s future will be in places beyond the homes."
"Sapphire, the makers of the app discovery based app testing platform for Android, said it reached a key deal with Apple today, with a new app search result. This confirms the company’s earlier earlier reports about the deal, which had pegged its acquisition at $250.
The search giant has also confirmed how it will serve up more product news for Android-powered devices in the future. It will, for example, launch a new Android app for every major operating system, as well as a new Android app store in the months ahead for its own Android apps.
The search results from Sapphire’s app discovery platform for apps can be embedded on both Android and iOS, as well as have integrated with the various Android devices. The company will offer a free app search in select apps, which is a step ahead of Google’s app discovery program, as well as other initiatives like Google Play and Facebook’s App Center, the latter of which recently got announced. This gives Apple access to the search results found in the original app, but will now be able to find new ones, too, with the help of third-party developers.
At this point, it can be quite simple to pick out apps by searching for apps from a variety of categories, like Music, Books, Games, Movies, Photography, Social, Music, Books, and Books for example, as opposed to going a more traditional search.

The fact that these results are now on Android means that the app publishers can get even more engaged with the results, in the process giving app discovery a little boost. Of course, that could give developers a leg up, which would lead into longer engagement, and maybe even an eventual sale or revenue in the form of ads.

On any mobile device running Android, the search results will also appear when the phone contacts an app (whether that app is installed on or pre-installed).
The Sapphire App Discovery platform currently supports iOS and Android, and recently added an option for Android to join the fold. It also supports Android apps installed on a mobile handset, Android tablets, and Android TV users, and an emulant Android application. An “official” Android app is soon due out next year.
It’s worth pointing out that the app listing is also being created just to give people a chance to test their applications. Apps developers can still create new listings, just their app’s description, which should also result in an improved user experience.
Sapphire is a team of 25, and that could change in the future. The platform, which has been in private beta, is up and running. For those interested, you can access the Sapphire App Directory here."
"One of the challenges in the mobile shopping space is a lack of easy, streamlined and convenient shopping interfaces. It’s an issue, however, that we see from other platforms like Shopping Express. Today, it appears that the company has hit a breakthrough and is on a mission to do just that.

 for the next year."
"The U.K. has been going through a tech-driven ‘Great British’ migration, with over one million EU citizens now living in the country. Now, the U.K. Government is planning a tech conference which will bring an element of “the Silicon Milkroundabout” — bringing the tech startup community and the government closer together — into East London’s Clerkenwell district. The conference is due to take place in April.
To join the conference a company must apply to be a tech entrepreneur. Those who do are not, shall undergo a ‘entry interview’ on the first Monday of February next year to be screened for the next phase of the U.K. Investor visa scheme that aims to bring together startups with the potential to develop the most innovative software and digital products. These applicants will have to prove that they have a plan to grow the U.K., raise a minimum of £300,000 in order to be in the U.K.
Companies will be able to apply from anywhere to London, wherever they may be. These can be in the form of free pitches, or a joint demo day — at Tech City, or a series of events — with the event taking place on February 28.
All in all, there are 30,000 U.K. tech startups waiting to get in the door – you better move quickly if you want to be one of the first tech companies to get selected for Tech City’s demo day.
The U.K. is a hub of international tech, attracting talent from across the globe, and it has to be hopeful that the startup ecosystem here is starting to catch up with the global scale of today’s digital world.
On the other hand, the U.K. is currently in a “digital recession”, with unemployment at nearly half of the national population having lost jobs in the last 12 months.
Tech City was supposed to serve as the U.K.’s tech startup magnet. However, it has not been able to create a major buzzword or even generate a bona fide (English) startup community. Even if its ‘Silicon Milkroundabout’ turns out to be a thing — at least in my view — it will create a great deal of hype about the U.K. itself that can benefit from its technological prowess.
One of the issues with the U.K. startup scene and is the need for a high level of homegrown entrepreneurialism.  Here we have five examples of that problem:
The U.K. now has a thriving startup community.  We’ve all been on AngelList trying to find the best potential investors and founders — and there are many who have found the best deals.  However, in fact we’re often seeing startups that have found that they may be able to make their own mark in Silicon Valley.  As the first in what we will hopefully be a series of workshops in Silicon Valley.  
The U.K. is a hub of international companies, with its own ecosystem and therefore not getting the U.S. in any real way. The U.K. has a lot of great companies — like Spotify, which is the third largest global music streaming service — but its biggest success thus far probably comes from the music streaming service Rockbox from the indie music group The Pods.

So, there we are — and many of the U.K. startups we are speaking with have their U.K. honours — but it is often a matter of proximity or lack of a proper Silicon Valley hub. The other problem is that we are increasingly surrounded with so much technology, and so our work/life balance is becoming increasingly precarious.
And we’re also a digital city with a lot of people using smartphones: one wonders, often with frustration, if we can now and then talk to someone on the bus in a way that doesn’t feel like so much work.
The U.K. is also going through a major tech innovation. The U.K. is a hot spot for Internet of Things, with a lot of people working in energy, renewable energy and fintech. The U.K. boasts some of the best technical colleges, and some of the leading tech startups in the country, and is building out its own set of business-to-business/SaaS solutions.
The U.K. is just like Europe. We’ve seen a big tech boom over the last 5 years, with over 70,000 new technology jobs created over the past year and 20,000 new employees joining the U.K.-based tech companies. However, in 2010 there was only 1,5K new technology jobs nationwide; over the next decade the U.K. was going to see more than 8,000 new technology positions.
Some of the recent successes:

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
comes in a number of ways, including new types of business models, new forms of marketing and a new location-based data set. I’m thinking all of the above, but they are just getting started, as we speak.
Here is the list of features, though they’re not all new:

I had to go talk a bit deep here because it was the first time I had a tech company announce in my hometown. They are:
We’re in the new generation of startups that have a mobile and web vision about business and customer experiences.
And because we’re in a market with the best data you can get, and so many of the large companies are going there with their own apps, many of them are going to the cloud and their data centers. I’m sure that will give more interesting information in the future.

But it’s not always about the revenue. It’s about the fact that companies that have a mobile vision are really trying to tackle a new market with new models.
It’s about data. They have data now – and they know how much of a market it is, and that data is going to be in the market. “We also have this set of data sets that we can use to offer enterprise-level marketers and other companies what they need to do – whether it is an SEO campaign to boost search traffic, or an app to get people to go back to the website, and so on.”
It’s the data that drives big and small successes like these.
Here’s one simple idea. How have you gotten traction? Where have you been? What have you done about your competitors? What are your strengths? When I asked this, Google could provide better answers than anyone but at the same time, I wanted to hear the feedback. I spoke to someone who has done big and small wins, and he said they are “just like the rest of us.” People always ask, “Is all this data good?” But I feel like all of this is validation of the idea. That is, it’s data, and it’s good.
The question is, where should you go to get all of this data?
The answer usually comes back to the customer.
The biggest challenges are getting that data out. There’s a lot of things that have a lot of potential to the market. But when you get a big customer, you need to know where to get the data.
It’s easy, but it’s hard. Once you get it out, you have to deal with it. Once you get it running, it’s time to figure out where the data goes from here on out to where the customers need it. In order to know where to get it, you need to figure out how you can efficiently access the data and how you can process it in an efficient way.

What is a normal day like?
For example, here’s a simple example. You’re a media company that has been using Google and Facebook as a way to advertise. Your daily goal is to make sure that the content is getting out to the Web. Your daily goal is to get those readers talking about your content.
In other words, you’re trying to figure out an effective way to make sure that your content gets out to Facebook. Then, you want to figure out where your sales team can go to get a word out to their friends. You need to find a way to do that efficiently and in a scalable way.
The average consumer does not know how to process that data in the appropriate way.
They’ll look at it, but generally speaking, it is easy to get wrong.  I’m sure that’s one of the most common ways to fail.
If you’d like to get a more solid set of data out of Google and Bing, find some tools that make it easy.
Then, find a way to use the data to make a better product and then you can use that product to drive more sales.
Here’s my prediction for how big marketing will be in the future. The only thing that is going to remain the same is the data set.
But the future comes with data. In the near term it’s the business-level analytics that will stay the same. And the key thing that happens next, the big question is not to look at the future, but look at the actual results.
And then we’ll have all these data sets to look at."

"Today at Disrupt San Francisco 2014, Line announced several new features, including the addition of an in-app “Watch Manager” for managing your line and the addition of “Zombies Free Zone” for collecting more free games.
To make those updates come, Line is also introducing some other new features.
Line Line is now letting its users build custom labels, which will allow retailers to give their products a freebie or promotional price. These labels are just as big as the products themselves, but allow them to take away a bit of the branding from Line’s other mobile applications.
The update also makes it easier for Line users using its third-party app, Line Messenger, to switch to the newer Line Lite app, which also lets people make their own labels.
The iOS Version of Line will now be updated with new features, specifically a simplified way to control your Line Chat with the new Line Manager. Additionally, the Android update is now out as well.
With today’s new features, Line is also adding a free-scoring feature that will allow users on Line to post a video in a variety of ways.
This lets Line users post a Message board like look up for Line Chat that provides the best of Line Chat, as well as a “Talks” feature where you can share your Line chat with friends or other groups in Line’s chat room. This will allow fans and fans of LineChat to communicate without necessarily having to post a Line Chat message themselves."
"This morning at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2014, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky discussed the future of the Airbnb brand, and how to build a team that would be “really strong next”. And it seems like they learned a lot here.
The conversation was broad, but it is worth revisiting. Chesky admitted that Airbnb is a startup trying to break in to the incumbents’ spaces, as opposed to an incumbent company in its own right. But it has been able to do so without the usual marketing capital that comes with incumbents, which also means it can compete — or at least keep its own house in play as it expands elsewhere. But it might not be long before we see Airbnb disrupt more than those incumbents.
“We don’t want to be another Airbnb or HomeAway,” Chesky said. “We want to build the best house in town for every single family. This is about the future. People want to own a home. We want to build the best homes on the planet.”
And that really means disruption to many of its current customers and other potential groups of users. The company is currently operating in 32 cities across the country, and is planning to launch in 25 more cities by the year’s end. The company has raised more than $500 million to date, but that includes Series E rounds in 2015, and a recent $100 million financing round announced in December.
“We are not going to just sell more houses, but we want to be the best house in town for every family,” Chesky said.
Airbnb is also taking a different approach to its business in general than Uber, whose business model relies on it to make money. This is more about growth — “We want to be the Uber of car availability,” Chesky said, while Uber essentially makes money off of commissions to take that commission away. Airbnb, meanwhile, is focused on revenue generation in these cities, and has yet to make money.
“We’ll be able to bring the best experiences to our customers, and they’ll want that. If you are an owner of a house, you should never have a hard time finding a truck,” Chesky said. “You should never have to wait 10 minutes to find a plumber. We want to make home owners better.”"
"I received a pair of sunglasses last week and they are actually pretty comfortable and stylish when I wear them in the wild. It’s one of those things that looks good on and off, as if you had them on you. The band is not like a normal pair of sunglasses – it’s an electronic hybrid design made of LEDs strung together in a sequence which matches the temperature and brightness of the sun in real time.
The LEDs are called “dumb lights” and they are powered by a simple circuit board that is powered by microUSB. A small USB battery module that was powered by that USB battery charge, and then used to input and display information from the app on your phone. All of this is designed to be very simple to use, especially since the LEDs are so small. Think about the “likes” your parents say

 accomplish the new functionality at the company’s campus in London.
“With this new funding, the company can focus on its growth strategy and will look to double down on growing its workforce in the next 12 months,” the company notes.
It also looks like the company is taking a very tight-moutric approach to the U.S. market: as the name implies it will focus on its first product — the iBeacon platform, built on top of the open source beacons technology that Samsung acquired  — which will be sold in the market first, and where Apple’s own retail operation — retail outside those walls.
We don’t know for sure how many devices are being sold yet, but what’s notable is that at least two other Android mobile makers are making some kind of move around some of the same kind of tech. That’s a little odd to see, although this is what the market so far looks like."
"Google’s Drive application has been slow to adapt to iOS use cases. It used to take advantage of the multitasking function you had to pull down to jump from one app to the next. But iOS developers have made the same change that it uses to do so.
Until today, Drive app users could do a few things. One was open the app once within another app. But a number of developers who have updated the app to support iOS have added some more flexibility into the iOS version.
The company, which now has 80 million iOS users, can better handle multitasking with its new multitasking interface. For example, when you wake the app, you can use the right-swipe gesture to launch a separate app that you were already using. Or, you could launch an application that you used on the iPhone earlier or that you have the same intention. Here’s a demonstration provided by Google.


Here’s an example of multitasking, using a simple and simple method, by using the left-swipe gesture.

A lot of times, developers are changing the way apps work. But this change is just the beginning.
“We’ve got lots of other work left to do on multitasking. We wanted those things to be as consistent as possible,” said Jason Kincaid , who works on the Android engineering team. He’s also a longtime Android app developer, which means how hard he works on it.
This is one of the other challenges with iOS 9. iOS is finally getting some kind of multitasking so users can swipe up and down on apps and use the screen to search for things. And that’s something iOS developers are starting to use and will have to go on.
“I have to make this work,” Kincaid said.
Drive is one of the first to take care to iOS’s multitasking needs. The company is aware that this is a popular task because of the use cases the user will have. “With Drive, you have this big window, you have the ability to pick and choose, and then navigate all the way down,” he said.
As of last October, Drive was one of the first to get the feature on Android. In fact, the company has the Android version already on the market — and it works on phones running 1.4.1 and up (though there are Android devices that aren’t quite ready to use it yet such as the Moto G)
I’m curious to see how Drive handles multitasking on iOS. Did it ever get the multitasking bug mixed up?
While I don’t believe Drive is ready for iOS, I would definitely want more options. For example, when I do a simple search for an address, I tend to use the first option, “Drive.” This is a different user interface approach that could solve some problems for people.
However, I could imagine many iOS developers releasing multi-window apps, and making it more flexible. Instead of the traditional one-window pop over and over, I’d prefer a more intuitive way to jump to the next app after the first open Drive.
I would really like to see the ability to add a “Drive” link to notes. It’s still in the iOS form, which could help make it easier to use as an app. For example, when I type a tweet, I want to select “Drive.” With a Drive link, a user could use the same process.
For those who might be waiting for some Android multitasking, you can already do this by pressing a single button inside of Drive. This keyboard shortcut will pop up in the iOS app.
When you pull up to get to another app, there’s a small window that lets you select the app you want to launch. If you pick “Drive” here, it

 year. It’s also experimenting with location-based “smart city” ideas, something that perhaps we’re already familiar with.
“We’re always exploring new types of location-based technology,” said Hynesworth on Wednesday. “We do have some ideas for things to play with but nothing concrete at this stage.”
Meanwhile, the startup “has been working on something there for a while”, according to Hynesworth. “We had been playing with GPS tracking and have been using that technique to identify places in London,” he said.
“But we’ve never really worked with it in real, live city. We’re just beginning to figure that out now. And so we’ve been talking to people about location-based, smart cities, and we’ve certainly had some interest from the U.K. space, too.”
The launch of an app to enable users to share photos of where they want and need to go was a long time coming, given that the company began developing the startup back in 2009, and it opened the doors to the public this May.
Initially being used at its startup showcase venue MakersLab London, the app has now reached over a million users — although this is not very much of a ‘stat’ since it will also be used elsewhere, such as for crowd-funding in the tech startup community. But the idea is to make the process of sharing and selling photos as easy as it is to post them on Instagram (or use other social media channels, if you prefer). It’s free to use — and it’s a great one to use."
"Apple’s iPad mini may have been delayed, but the company still wants to offer Apple Pay options for its customers, according to some new details uncovered by 9to5Mac. The new details relate to how Apple has been offering pre-ordained Apple Pay options that can be found at all participating stores using the magnetic field of the iPad mini’s magnet.
The most recent versions of the iPad’s mini are the iPad mini 2 and iPad, but also the iPad mini Air and iPad mini 2. But both devices support Apple Pay cards, for those devices.
Apple has made an almost identical pre-ordained option for using Apple Pay cards – the original card and PIN combination, for instance – the Apple Pay accessory that’s currently on the market.

Apple has had to delay before launch and/or transition to pre-ordained support for Apple Pay as a result of pressure from both existing and new users, but the new details shed further light of the company’s larger goals for the new mobile payment product – and the challenges facing the company in achieving the end-to-end support for users on iOS.
Apple has to overcome the hurdles in implementing Apple Pay properly, given its potential popularity, and also the increasing competition and confusion among consumers and merchants around making that happen. Apple still has a number of things it needs to work out when and how to accomplish that kind of thing.
For one thing, Apple needs to work on making its end-to-end offering easier to use for both consumers and merchants. As a point of reference, it was a key element of Apple’s original plan for the Apple Watch, which also includes having a user-friendly design and a very simple user experience. It’s possible that Apple is working on a solution like this itself, so this is one area where Apple has been actively working.
The second key element to make Apple Pay work on tablets is security. Because Apple already allows for the ability to share a passcode to other devices, that means that an iPad can’t just share a passcode with the iPad mini itself.
In addition, there are issues with the way in which devices with a magnet or magnets attached are configured to work with Apple Pay’s magnetic field. That means that a “Magic Circle” on a tablet could be turned on and off by the app. It’s unclear whether or when Apple will be addressing this specific complaint, but it’s an interesting idea.
It’s also worth noting that while the iPhone 6 still doesn’t support Apple Pay, it has enabled the feature in the past, but hasn’t necessarily embraced it the past. So while Apple could easily add support for Apple’s new feature in Apple Pay that introduces a card in its passcode, it’s also worth noting that it’s working on an Apple Pay accessory for their own mobile devices, as well."

.
A spokesperson sent me a statement clarifying the decision:
As for the legality of the platform itself, there is nothing really that I’ve seen to indicate that it’s unsafe.
But it seems clear, and given the nature of Facebook’s mission, whether it’s promoting more connected relationships or just a better user experience, it seems questionable how this will effect its long-term success. I talked about this yesterday, but the main point I’m making is about more open discussion around the subject of online privacy, whether that’s for those who are in relationships, or the wider community at large.
What’s more, to get that done, more open forums are one way Google could have an impact, and that in turn could keep Google in control of the narrative of online privacy. It’s no doubt one of the bigger themes for the next several years.
Here’s Google’s statement in response to a request for comment (the link is dead):"
"Facebook launched Pages for years, but it’s really starting to show off the capabilities and advantages that come when you give away private information about your friends and the world. It’s the first time that it’s done this, with the new Open Graph notifications feature. Facebook is now giving more details about how it’s taking advantage of the notifications feature, and what’s new with the idea of private browsing.
Facebook’s advantages include the way it drives traffic to your Pages, and how it drives signups. The latter will give you the option to log into Facebook through a notification (rather than on the web or native apps), and it adds a few benefits:
It’s important to be careful of how these new notifications you receive, given that it’s not a secret you can already see their name or icon. I’ll leave a comment if the feature gets a lot more widespread next week, for example when Facebook starts adding more information.
As Facebook’s new system, which is essentially the next phase of the evolution of the way it’s viewed its network of developers and users, it’s getting more efficient and simpler.
Facebook’s goal of building a walled garden inside the app has been an important element of its success. The more you build, the happier your friends are going to find you and they think of you when you share content.
Facebook is also making it easier for people who already want to share to their Page to find the right people. In January, it created “Lists With Friends,” a new feature that lets you look at all the links you share around the web that have been shared with people in your network, and the people those links are coming from. For example:

Users can add links to these notifications by visiting their own URLs using the new Facebook Page’s settings.
This will not just give Facebook insights about how people are sharing or connecting with users, but how it’s helping people find people they want to talk to. Facebook recently became the most popular app among social networking apps, if not the most popular app among friends (Facebook was ranked first and second), according to the average check-in on Facebook by a user.
In the new implementation, these notifications will be seen as the “Lists” you will get. It’s not a bad system, but if you know someone’s name or icon, there’s not much incentive to share that content. If you know your Facebook friends’ names or email addresses, you’ll also want to know if they’ll share them too.
This new notifications feature is not only a new feature, but it’s also a pretty significant departure from how Facebook’s been known — and has justified — for making it easy to invite family and friends on Facebook.
At the time of making its launch notifications, Facebook also talked about how these notifications could be personalised. That approach may have been the right one in the current situation, with the Open Graph idea where a larger pool of people can get updates in their newsfeed from those with whom they have engaged, but in terms of the new system, where Facebook’s own News Feed is still the primary site of news, perhaps it makes sense to give a bit more time to personalise notifications.
Facebook is also going the other direction with this new system. It’s now able to track the relevance, as a “Worthy Leader.” A brand that’s been proven to be popular within the app and to be popular with users, has the potential to get these notifications to people who might be considered a friend.

As a measure of its power, this is a product that has become a popular, and perhaps defining, component of the Facebook community

 and the right way to share them — to put their music in front of the people who actually want to hear it.
“No one’s solved this, but I think that’s interesting,” Dovino said. “It’s only going to really take a few iterations before this really becomes a commodity.”
But I was still curious about the company’s bigger plans for its service — specifically around how to leverage partnerships that help drive Spotify’s monetization efforts. Right now, the company has a few partnerships in place with NPR, Sirius XM and a host of others, but that’s just the beginning. A recent partnership with Conde Nast and Deutsche Telekom to share music and other music-related content was particularly big, and could lead one of many opportunities to leverage partnerships.
But Dovino didn’t have any news, other than working on the new listening experience itself. He did, however, add that Spotify was working on a social product, that would allow people to see how much music they’d been listening to in the SoundCloud community, and to create playlists — and share those playlists back to Soundcloud permanently.
Part of what makes SoundCloud compelling to big publishers today is that it’s part of SoundCloud’s DNA, and part of its DNA in part. The team behind SoundCloud has plenty of experience building music and digital services, many of which took part in the 2008/09/05/08 (and later) growth period of the company. The first big move was the expansion to audio content with the launch of Audien.
The other thing that has likely made SoundCloud a popular partner from music companies on other fronts is that, in many ways, the company will still represent a direct competitor to Spotify itself. “Spotify is all about content,” Dovino noted, “but SoundCloud is all about music discovery and music taste. We’re focused on finding new music fans and really helping them discover what they love. We’re a curation platform that gives people a good music search service.”
The company currently offers users a limited catalog of 40k tracks, but when Dovino revealed some of the features that are coming with the new listening experience, it was clear that there were also a fair number of potential integrations. For example, Dovino said that SoundCloud has around 100k users right now. So going in, you could see a lot of potential collaborations where Spotify might add certain songs, then find new versions of the songs that use the “Find New” function to include those tracks.
The big question will be: how will this work in the long run, given that it just launched two days after its biggest competitor, Spotify, launched its own version of a free Spotify-like service that could cost $10/year to $30/year. The company certainly isn’t the only one. Competitor Pandora saw a huge success in launching both its own personalization and social discovery APIs without the need for its own acquisition.
The important part of Dovino’s pitch to investors was the availability of the service’s API. The company says that all companies that use its service will have access to its API soon. But at the same time, though, these APIs might not be as broadly applicable as some of the music and content that might be available through SoundCloud.
As Dovino noted, though, he’s confident that the platform will be broad to any number of people, and that it’ll be compatible with many different forms of media beyond just music. “We can create a full, proprietary listening experience,” he said.
At the same, while the platform is built into SoundCloud, it might not be limited by the company’s own technology. The company has invested in its own SoundCloud Music.com (not unlike what SoundCloud does with its own radio programming), and it’s also adding more functionality to the platform with new features like Discovery.
The company isn’t necessarily competing with and is already working with third-party services like Spotify and Rdio, but it is hoping that by partnering with these companies and the platforms of its competitors, it can be the go-to service. And that may work out well for those interested in discovering new music, which might not be a big deal if that’s how the rest of the listening population turns out,"
"When a new social network, Zynga, is formed, it is generally a good thing. So when Zynga’s first games became the hits on Zynga’s games like Farmville, the company found a good place to test out concepts and find what to incorporate into its games. Of course, the company did experiment with what some users wanted more than

 in the world but even the most sophisticated online banking systems today struggle to understand the intricacies of customer and seller transactions or how to display a useful new product.
In many cases, online banks fail to educate sellers on how to manage their inventory and properly secure transactions,” COO of PayPal China Xinhui Yu said during the development of Alibaba’s new product news. “A significant portion of the merchants in China rely upon website verification and other online marketing services to get a strong and healthy profit.” Online sellers must understand that they need to secure a healthy profit — and not to go into business with the most unfavorable terms.
“For merchants selling in China, it is not feasible to have a negative outcome or risk the worst things, such as negative feedback.” Yu added. “The merchants in China are very aware of what the possible and what is necessary. They know in advance for the merchants in the country.” Yu added."
"Chinese consumer internet company Tencent has released its 2016 annual report tracking its social media services in the country.
The report estimates that Tencent will be worth more than 4 trillion RMB ($4 billion) as recently as July 2015. It also tracks monthly active user and daily actives, and traffic by mobile platform. (Those are in addition to Tencent’s other social sites like WeChat, which also holds a dominant position in Chinese online travel and e-commerce.) It also tracks online payment transactions.
But it’s the social spending side of things that is more important for Tencent to understand, and for U.S. company Snapchat to get a better hold on this area. The U.S. company announced a series of memos explaining Tencent’s financials, and also the growth of China’s top Internet companies as a growth driver during the report.
And Tencent’s investment strategy seems to be a bit different to Silicon Valley. Last year, Tencent bought a majority stake in messaging app Telegram. In an interview with Tech In Asia after a presentation, chief strategist and global strategy officer Lei Jun told me that messaging transactions, which totaled more than $1 billion in transactions, are ‘big data’ investments.
“The big challenge in China,” Lei Jun said, “is that Chinese consumers still live predominantly in a offline world. There are a lot of problems in the market and we need to take social media and make it a more prominent part of everyday life.”
So Tencent is building the infrastructure for doing more social media in China, but it might also be helping to build an ecosystem around it. That would create a marketplace for brands and other businesses, more advertising-powered social networks, and more mobile social networks that help Chinese consumers and businesses connect with each other, and consumers in Asia.
“We don’t have the monopoly on social media or online content, so we want to make social media more mainstream, more than just celebrities and celebrities,” Lei Jun told Tech In Asia.
And beyond that, there is still a major issue: the country is currently struck by a shortage of consumers on Alibaba’s network, and Tencent also offers some services beyond messaging, but it does not plan to expand its presence in China.
While Alibaba and Tencent have made a bit more international than other big U.S. tech firms, such as Facebook, Tencent is still not a big name in the U.S. that is, by nature, Alibaba.
“Alibaba’s Facebook is doing well in China, but I think the U.S. is also too big for them to ignore,” Lei Jun told Tech In Asia, referring to messaging business that is still very much focused on the online search market, which grew by a whopping 75 percent during 2016 year-2015. “I think that more companies in China will be focused on mobile media and commerce and more on the media and commerce business instead of big data and data analytics business.”
“It isn’t a strategic decision to acquire the next big thing in China when it is ready,” Lei Jun continued. “It isn’t the big data, which is why Tencent has no big idea what kind of news news teacher will be. They have no idea which way this year’s events will be.”"

 in “over 100 channels,” according to a presentation provided by the company. That’s pretty impressive, on paper, but given that it seems like the network is still in closed beta, where some of the users may have already snapped photos of what they should be posting to Facebook and Instagram. The idea is to open up the platform for a wider range of users in the hopes of creating content that’s up to snuff.
Facebook is a big user of this already, and has a good long way to go to turn it into an even more dominant platform than it already is. It’s no secret that Instagram and Facebook Messenger are so dominant that right now this entire industry is run through Facebook and Instagram. It might sound crazy, but if Facebook can control and connect different aspects of your life in a new way — like what Instagram is doing with photos, for example — it could take the place of photo sharing apps like Instagram and WhatsApp, and the big social networks that now dominate access to mobile messaging."
"This evening, Twitter will host its first in-depth developer meetup. It’s going to be a special Hangout in NYC at the Citié de Numérique at 6pm for a quick drink, beer, pizza and a quick discussion about what’s new in the world of tweets.
We’ll have an awesome time. We’ll get to chat about Android, iOS and the future of the web in our conversation between Zynga CEO David Ko, TechCrunch writer MG Siegler and TechCrunch writer Eric Eldon. They’ll play some games together and share their thoughts about what the company has launched on and what’s going on at a startup level.
We’ll have a chance to get to ask questions, but at the time, we’ll be mostly focused on talking about what the heck Facebook has built. We’ll talk about mobile analytics companies and the like, as well as ask questions that might be off-putting at a public company and other services.
We’ll chat about what it’s like on the other side of the world, what it’s like to build a social network in the last eight years, and why the latest acquisition is a sign of how important the social network becomes to everything we do.
It all boils down to how to build a relationship with Twitter. Our time will be at this event over there, on the other side of the city at 9pm. Let us know what you want with an open mind. We’ll have a drink, and talk about what we think might be interesting in the world of social networks."
"Twitter is giving everyone a quick way to try out its mobile app and help them to sign up for, say, a free monthly plan. Starting today, anyone in the U.S. who is starting their Twitter journey by opening a new account will be able to buy an ad to sign up.
When it first launched its ad buying platform in the U.S. in 2012, Twitter made one of its first moves to integrate ads directly into the site. When it says new things like a new app, it does. And Twitter’s latest moves, for those who are already on a mobile platform and aren’t as active with Twitter right now (if you have the iPhone, Android and iPad apps, you don’t need a code-of-the-day to sign up), is a way to start seeing advertising in Twitter.
While the company has been making a lot of progress in one respect — it has added more tools, for example, to help people buy their first sponsored “click-to-call” ads — it didn’t seem like Twitter could get away with this.
Still, when you opened the Twitter Twitter app for the first time or logged in, you’d find there was no ads in sight.
The company has kept the ads within the app, but made the ads available via a third-party service. You could find your Twitter friends’ tweets you might want to buy, for example, or Twitter that you might be interested in following. The company has also opened up an advertising API that it used to create its Twitter Cards so developers could create other applications as well.
The company also launched its own dedicated iPhone application earlier this month, while others could follow your Follow account on Twitter. The company says that Twitter will be making all ads purchased on TweetDeck free, so no one has to use this service.
This brings the total number of ads on Twitter’s platform to 17. At the time, Twitter noted these other features like the new Twitter Cards, the newly launched Twitter Cards that shows Twitter users where they’re trending as you

 same of these will be able to sign up at least ten clients for its platform. (The firm says one such client has a “giant” enterprise network of 100,000-plus companies, which use HootSuite to manage their social media accounts.)
The funding, of course, also provides HootSuite with validation that it is in the business of monetizing mobile app interactions — which is increasingly important because of consumer demand for third-party services.
In addition to this funding, HootSuite says that it has already made significant inroads into international markets. And as for what HootSuite actually does, it writes, “We’ve seen this year that HootSuite is launching its first international product—our first in the UK.” For now, HootSuite hasn’t offered a full list of all the products it now offers, or even a ranking for where those products fit into the landscape.
One interesting aspect of HootSuite’s platform is that its ability to integrate an existing customer loyalty program (where customer numbers count up to the first 100,000+ users) is very much a hit:
“Our customers love loyalty and recognize that social sharing can significantly increase conversions — especially for online and offline channels,” noted Gemani and Palantir’s VP of Product, Leo Fasbender, in a joint statement."
"After more than a year of hard work, Adobe has announced its first iPhone app at its annual Adobe Max conference in Cupertino, and today also announced that it has released two versions of its Creative Cloud Suite, Photoshop Elements CC and Premiere Elements CC. The new releases are designed to help Adobe’s Creative Cloud push its CC software onto smartphones and tablets.
When asked if the company would soon also release an OS for iPad or other devices, a spokesperson said that the company is currently working on both. It will likely appear within the Creative Cloud mobile and desktop software suites as soon as it is ready for launch, although the timing may be another couple of months out.
“Today’s debut will bring all of Adobe’s creative cloud collection and functionality into the mobile devices and tablets that will create a fundamental shift in the mobile landscape, bringing new capabilities, new capabilities and new opportunities to improve collaboration with the Creative Cloud,” said Michael Price on the sidelines of the keynote.
Adobe also announced that it has finally launched its Creative Cloud, a new collection of creative cloud libraries. The company announced that it will be offering 20 different licenses for use with Adobe CC, with some more than 20 new games.
Here’s the full list of licenses available with this release:"
"The first four years of the Web fell into a few pitfalls. The first, the core problem was how to deal with an API so that users who wanted all the functionality could create an account and use the apps with their colleagues. The second problem was more around developers getting all the advantages of a platform before other developers, as you would expect it to have a massive influence on how many services are being developed. Then the final problem was how to make it work in the first place. The Web is now ready, but it will be hard until further improvements are made, and it’s far from perfect yet.
The new version of Adobe CC, however, may be the major improvement to make things a bit better. It’s also ready to ship now with Safari 4.1. So far, most of the early testers, like eGroups, have been using Google Reader.
Google Reader as a first version is the most noticeable improvements, having an upgraded homepage, redesigned tabs, and a new search. The old version of Reader never managed to hit a major milestone and we all know because we have a ton of people who use Reader. It is great that Google Reader will be there, but for the first time in many months, it’s even more noticeable.
Google Reader has been around for a decade already. Adobe Reader is the first step. Now we can also say that the early adopters are the tech world.
The new version of Adobe CC will be available on all platforms. For developers, most of the problems associated with CC are gone, and it will be much easier to port their apps.
And now, Adobe is taking a significant step and trying to put it into a new category on mobile. With its new APIs, a more powerful mobile application will go from a few tens of thousands to tens of millions of users. Developers will have to build on top of this new platform just to stay relevant going forward on mobile without having to find their apps. And it turns out that the mobile Internet is not all that useful on a large scale since most people are not the largest enterprises.
But there’s also a much different mobile UI that comes with the new mobile SDK. The first one

 index that doesn’t include the monthly rate.
This is, of course, only a partial discount of the full price. Price drops will be announced in the coming weeks. But for now, we can understand that a single trip can get the company quite a bit of money.
So if you were a frequent traveler, you could probably use the service for the occasional airport hop. And if you’re a frequent customer of an airport, chances are the average person will book two or three times in order to save money. But what if you are a frequent sleeper? Where do you want your money back?
The company already supports more than 20 airlines, and is working hard to deliver even more. But it’s even clearer that the company doesn’t want to be a “magic bullet,” that’s what you’re looking for. The product will be more broadly available in early 2016.
The funding comes from Gilt, Redpoint Ventures, Index Ventures, Foresight Ventures, and lots of angels. “We’ve invested quite a bit so far and I don’t know that it would have been without that. And I think it’s safe. In terms of user experience, it’s very clear. We’re not trying to reinvent flight. It will be fun,” says Alesa.
You can get the app here on iOS (SF and NYC only at the moment). While I’m sure you’ll enjoy using it, I don’t think you’ll find anything new in the way other companies have created."
"Apple just updated its App Store review process which will now allow apps to gain more visibility on both the iTunes App Store and the App Store search results. App discovery is a huge part of Apple’s business strategy and it’s a crucial tool for both developer and hardware maker as Apple makes App discovery increasingly competitive and makes it possible to reach new audiences.
The company recently updated the App Store review flow by opening it up for apps that had previously been rejected, and this week it made a significant move to open up its own search engine as well. Apple knows you’re looking for new apps, and it can’t just show you the latest offerings. It needs to provide more value — more than simply a simple search — that can be customized in any manner that you can think of.
The App Store will now feature search from a number of third-party developers, including those already listed on the App Store, but most just offer search of the App Store. As Apple gets more aggressive with its search business, it does so within its App Search terms of service, which has become a must-read for those who’s looking to make it easy to find the App Store:

What’s truly interesting is that it now completely replaces the search service. It no longer shows the latest content to everyone with an algorithm instead favoring those that have just been published onto the App Store, meaning that all your previous searches will now be included in search.
At first I thought that it wasn’t that important for me to have a search tool that served third-party developers, but there’s clearly value for Apple. When that happens, it opens up more possibilities."
"I’m usually hesitant to include an image macro-like image macro in my posts, but sometimes I need something catchy. I recently found that I need those kinds of images in particular for a new product out of Poshmark, a photo-sharing and social network application.
Poshmark was founded by Jordan Stone and Dali Kilani, who wanted to bring social networking to the web. Like other social networks like Facebook and Twitter, Poshmark is focused on building communities and connecting people to one another, but with a focus on photo and video.
“There are two fundamental parts to social,” explains Stone. “It’s social and it’s where your connections connect. It’s about being direct friends with people you trust, and then being direct friends with people you don’t,” he says.

Stone is the creative director, and Kilani is the creative director of the web version of the app, which was just launched a couple of months ago.
“We built the site, the prototype, through Dali’s advice to Dali,” explains Stone. “Dali wanted to build a social network that you could use with images, but you don’t have to build a web tool.”
The prototype in front of me is pretty basic with the exception of the homepage’s background picture. There’s only a small “image editor” button, and the rest is just text. There are no images in there at all, either, and the

 next to the existing Q1 2016 release.
“We are seeing many customers moving to and using our service in Asia. Some customers are already paying we are very happy with the adoption,” added Sunil Gupta, director of e-commerce at LIFO.
LIFO, like Qum, operates a marketplace for brides to find new brides for its wedding services in Asia. In Malaysia, the company is also in discussions to expand into the country. So far, the company claims 300,000 brides using its service, with 3.5 million matches made on its platform.
As with LIFO, the company claims its e-commerce is faster and more expensive than the wedding planning space in Southeast Asia, where much of the competition is taking place in malls and online wedding registries. LIFO says that a half of its existing order backlog has been sold already, and that its team has grown to over 100 between it and its U.K.-born partner. The company monetizes through advertising and a mixture of discounts, charges from credit card companies, and in-app purchases.
“We like to develop our own way of dealing with the wedding industry in Southeast Asia,” added Sunil Gupta in a statement. “We have had very strong traction in this segment and we will continue to invest in growth.”
The investment in LIFO was part of the company’s wider strategy to build up its customer base beyond just weddings. The company has been on the up and the left after its merger with a Chinese wedding startup.
LIFO — which has invested in over 15 different VC firms — is planning to use the investment to expand into other parts of Asia, such as the Middle East and Southern Europe, and establish its presence in Southeast Asia and China itself.
“We have already invested to expand in the wedding space and the bride/brie space, and will continue to do so,” says Zain Jaffer, who co-founded the company with his brother Laj from a third-floor apartment in the U.S. that used to be the third floor for the hotel where LIFO is now based.
“There is much bigger marriage-related market opportunity in the region,” Jaffer added. “LIFO can really take the market and really push the area of wedding planning and celebration.”

LIFO currently offers a number of wedding services, including flower arranging, rental for a venue, and brides-to-be events held during the day that are tailored to that wedding season. It doesn’t compete with a plethora of other wedding destinations online in Southeast Asia. Other companies that are active in the region include Dreamworks Wedding, The Knot and The Knot Weddings, to name some.

LIFO is looking at a range of wedding registries to tap into the 300-million-plus wedding registries that already exist in the U.S. and Europe, but admits much of that market still remains offline, offline, in India, China and Southeast Asia.
“We are looking to tap into a number of other areas and we will continue to focus on the wedding space for the long run, but we also hope to be developing other areas, like flower arrangements or wedding planners,” Gupta told TechCrunch this month.
The startup is currently accepting applications for its upcoming software preview program — which has the ability to be integrated into several existing tools, including Woo and the Wedding (app), and Gupta said that it has more than 100 testers waiting to submit their applications. Right now, the company is bootstrapped, but plans to raise its $25 million Series B in the next couple of months."
"Dell today announced a major partnership with Microsoft called “Project Octopus,” which will enable customers and developers to build new products, content and experiences on top of the cloud-based service.
Project Octopus will bring in-memory storage and support for Docker container containers, both of which are essential to building modern applications — but just want to run locally over the same infrastructure (as I have with the same language/platform), then there’s just a few options that companies today on both the customer and developer sides have to do.
Today, those customers are simply using existing tools and services or using Docker containers when not using one of the many new offerings. But while Docker is very widely used and popular now, this is actually the “next stage” in application development for most enterprise companies, as developers need to be more able to create containers, host and interact with containers.
With Project Octopus, the idea is that customers can build with either one or both of these.
And not only that, as Dell’s business model is based around so-called software-defined networking and collaboration

 Hize has found another win for his startup ecosystem in the form of a $1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Natural Energy’s office and the Solar Energy Technologies Foundation.
Mullan said that the grant was part of a strategy of the government’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) to work with solar companies, as well as make outreach. It is part of the agency’s solar innovation, which is the government’s initiative to create more energy-efficient businesses through government investment.
He said the grant comes at a significant time for the solar energy industry, when competing with government-backed renewable energy initiatives like solar power is expected to account for more electricity usage this year than currently believe it will, and also when the U.S. is expected to become grid-dependent, with 40 percent of all energy used to power grid services.
Solar power currently accounts for 22 percent of the country’s electrical generation, including from some 23,000 public and industrial structures, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
But while the government has been setting up initiatives to encourage solar adoption, it has also been making a big push to encourage energy usage in more developed markets. In that context, he said that while a seamless announcement would have been welcomed at the Solar Energy Solutions International conference that’s taking place June 10 at California State University, it is yet another example of how the government is going far to push solar in this country.
“When you look at the U.S. solar energy policy, it is still early,” he said. “There’s lots to think about when you think about how this could help the world by reducing energy consumption.”
He estimates that if we cut our energy usage 20 percent and we actually got better for it, it would generate enough alternative energy sources that, by 2020, every American would use their energy the way they deserve and that they would have to control for and manage their own usage.
He also noted that the government has set a goal of using energy efficiency to improve citizens’ lives by 10 percent of the time, but it’s still much more important to him to push that point at a conference with the energy being produced by solar activity.
“If it costs enough to reduce energy consumption then it sounds worth it,” he said. “Innovation can be worth more than reducing your energy consumption; it’s a matter of improving your life.”
He also noted that the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Council predicts that the U.S. energy economy will grow to between $11 trillion and $15 trillion in 2025. That’s a significant growth rate, but the rate of growth has been slowed as solar uses more devices and energy are used.
“We have a very long way to go,” he said. “We hope to improve human productivity more than we do by reducing your energy consumption. If you are working for an organization with the ambition to improve your lifestyle, then that would be a worthy goal to pursue. If it turns out to be a successful path, we would like to see it ease that pain, and hopefully improve people’s lifestyles, a good portion of it.”"
"A new Facebook ad targeting tool called Optimized Audience Response will let businesses pay to have their ads shown to an eligible Facebook audience. Facebook announced this “new type of ad targeting” at f8 2014 this year.
Unlike other ad targeting tools, where Facebook may ask you to install software or conduct a qualifying test, Optimized Audience Response is designed to run a campaign against a specific user’s stated goals.
Instead of relying on what sounds like a vague or nebulous “managing goals” ad targeting tool, advertisers are getting a detailed program guide with detailed plans and timelines to create campaign targeting effectiveness and ROI. Plus, optimized audience can target by geography, age, gender, and other personal characteristic attributes.

A business can even specify the age of their target audience in the context of their campaign’s goals and tell how many of those demographics will need support (and may not need support at all) in order to justify a campaign.
Of course, it’s not just the advertisers who will benefit from targeted audience targeting. Facebook will also pay users for their participation (alongside paid app installs and other ad purchases via the ad).

At launch, advertisers will be able to upload a campaign, set goals for it, and then target ads to specific users who

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 that app users can pay in-app credits for gems inside a gemstone. With the in-app credit, users will have the ability to pay for gems elsewhere, whether that’s buying a gift, visiting a dungeon, or buying a star power up at a vendor’s shop.
The credit has a low limit to where it can go. The credit can be extended for gems up to five times per day, so users can use it for gems costing as much as $0.30, or more.

There’s simply a payment button integrated into the app — “Gems” in the app — which users can tap to pay for gems at a particular price or higher. They don’t have to keep going back, as they can automatically add the new money they make from playing Gemos. The credit system automatically detects that users have picked up a gem and automatically adds it to a Gem Wallet app account if they’re online for that specific gem. It’s also possible to create a recurring invoice if a Gem owner gets five or more gems, then keep the Gem up and running.

It’s a fascinating feature that taps into how people in traditional mobile and web apps have increasingly used their smartphones as remote control for their services. We now have tools for sending powerful messages to users via text messages, instant photos and messaging, and more, thanks to improvements in mobile devices with better processor power and a greater camera on the device. It’s a bit like how SMS used to work. Not nearly as prevalent, but very powerful.
Gem has also added a notification when a gemstone gets an update, letting it alert to the last gems up in your Gem Wallet account. There’s nothing too clever about this, but it does show that you can get more gems from the app. Since you can pick up gems from the app’s shop, there’s a high likelihood that a developer is releasing new gems into the Gem Wallet app for iOS or Android. There’s not much more that the app can do beyond alert you to new gems, but the current app is an interesting addition to a very different, emergent behavior in the mobile app space.
Gemos are pretty self-contained, and they’re well-designed. I played with two of the apps out there, and found no issues running through them or getting gems to my Gem Wallet account.

Another aspect of Gem that makes a strong case is that the app is compatible with multiple devices. That means you don’t need to keep going back and forth between iPhone and Android app stores to get the game or gem.
Co-founder and CEO Jordan Kelley told me the company has been working on the app for around three years, at an early stage, and it has actually been in development for almost four years. The design was always the primary concern, but after looking at the app and looking at how it was being used, it was clear that it was really doing something right. In fact, when you opened up the app for the first time, the notification was one of the only times that would tell you to do something because a gem had been moved in to your account.
After that, it’s just about paying the Gem.
“I had been testing a number of apps, and in most instances, the user would get a notification. Every time there’s a notification,” says Kelley. “I would get notification, and it would be really loud. I’d say, ‘why’s this here?’ And you would go to the Settings app and configure an app like this.”

The only issue I had was that the notification wasn’t a lot of fun. The app needs work, sure, but it’s good to have it, even if only temporarily. The app might offer more functionality in the future, but for now it’s a nice experience for the iPhone (and iPad and iPod touch) user."
"The problem of the past year or so of tech media, and now Spotify, is that it makes it easy to make friends. The most basic example is that Spotify may be an easy platform to build an audience on Facebook and Twitter, making it a huge channel for brands advertising. But beyond basic social graph data and likes of your friends, there are all of the details that make an app a must-have: cool, cool track names, and, in many cases, a cool brand.
The next step in this evolution is listening in, and listening to the music.
In an effort to further accelerate the evolution of music listening, Facebook today launched new features that let musicians create curated playlists, create listening lists within Facebook, and sell the playlists created within. It will all be handled by musicians, who will then be able to monetize those play

�s just an old picture of Facebook (for example. Facebook’s new design is very different in many ways.)
Facebook uses its search app Graph Search to pull up articles from your friends’ social feed feeds, and it uses its social sharing integration and photo sharing to drive tons of traffic to its site.

Facebook says the new news feeds’ design will be rolled out in the first half of 2015 and will cost $30 per user to use. The company also expects all of Facebook’s ad products to work just great as they did for desktop Facebook and its web user interface. The new look takes the Facebook ad product and makes it much more powerful for advertisers.

"We have heard reports of companies looking to make inroads into the area of 3D printed prosthetics. Today, the founders of a UK based company, Orthasys, confirmed earlier reports the company is in the process of raising an equity round for its biohybrid 3D-printed prosthetics arm, which will, as the company explained to TechCrunch, contributes to a “high life satisfaction”.
The investors in the round were not named. “We have not raised funding but the process is ongoing,” a spokesperson said.
“The round will certainly help the company and allow it to make further advances in terms of 3D printers,” the company said.
Oblasys — based out of Cambridge — has developed 3D printed prosthetics for patients who have suffered severe wound from violence or serious accidents, according to a spokeswoman. The startup itself launched in 2012.
While 3D printing is still in its infancy — with some startups like the soon-to-publicly-launched Replayson, though heavily influenced by other 3D technologies like the likes of Makerbot and Form One that are used for prototyping — 3D printed prosthetics seem likely to be a hot area of interest from tech companies at least for the foreseeable future.
Whether it’s the right idea to build the first 3D-printed prosthetic that can be printed on demand, or if the current market for 3D printed prosthetics languishes as one of the three factors that sets up the new space for startups is an open question.
“It was an important part of our strategy and will continue to be one of our focus areas,” a Facebook spokesperson said.
The idea behind a 3D-printed bionic remind me of a friend-project I started last year is not too different from a prosthetic arm, or a prosthetic hand on the stump. But there are several different advantages to 3D-printed prosthetics. The availability of cheap 3D printers, and the way that 3D printing is improving and improving at an increasing rate is what makes 3D printed prosthetics look like the next frontier in the mobile or additive 3D printing market: more convenient, cheaper and more comfortable.
This is a space that was somewhat left for dead in the first place at Makerbot’s shutdown. In the end, we’re still a long way from the days when 3D-printed arms were something that was somehow revolutionary enough to usurp the need for 3D printers. This is more about the next step in a trend, that will see more 3D devices moving forward to help us get to that time in the near — if all goes well — rather than the next step in the industry to come."
"The UK’s telecoms watchdog, Ofcom, is likely to start carrying out its investigation into how Facebook has used its users data in the past, including by opening a formal complaint with the Social Media Chief in the US over what it dubs as “unfair and unlawful” practices.
The watchdog had been working for a year on the issue, according to a UK government official, who has confirmed that it will launch an investigation. Facebook appears to be pushing for a formal investigation, both to resolve this legal issue and also to gain access to any findings from the ongoing criminal trial.
If it does launch a formal probe of Facebook’s use of some of its social and commercial user data, it would also be in a difficult position to make any conclusive findings for the government, according to the official, who also confirmed the existence of a formal complaint with Ofcom.
Facebook, which has faced privacy and privacy groups in recent months — including Back of the Internet, Privacy Activists, the European Union’s Safe Harbor and the now Google-owned WhatsApp — has a free ride on the

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Later, a few years ago, Google was focused on building out its own enterprise services.
It was then that it came back with the enterprise Google Search business. It saw that it struggled with how to compete against the likes of Amazon’s AWS. In the months leading up to the 2012 elections, Google’s business units were all doing something similar. Google’s product and infrastructure got roasted under the attack from Amazon, in an issue that happened to many years later.
The idea was that using cloud-based services to compete directly against incumbents would be better than doing it in your own home space.
In hindsight, it seems that Google should have realized the exponential effects of its attacking on the market position and its user base. The company did not take the time to learn about the effects of the program, its strategy and how it affected the cost and trajectory of its business.
For that reason, the Google Webmasters program was also never seen as a true tech program of its own. In retrospect, it should have not done anything to increase Google’s internal infrastructures, which allowed Google to maintain its position in the market. The company didn’t realize how these moves were infamous on Google’s part.
This program is not the only Google weeks that have come and gone without being investigated, and Google has not come for the sake of investigation. Perhaps it was more about trying to move the company toward that promoted future where it would play the role of one of the most dominant search engines on the web.
The company was certainly aware that it could also face accusations of antitrust violations. There appears to be only a handful of them in this case, including the current complaints filed by Oracle.
It is important for Google to understand that the government has a mandate to investigate and respond to antitrust violations. However, as Yahoo’s David Cowan explained on TechCrunch’s Twitter last night, an antitrust case is different from other types of complaints — one may be “about something more than a company” and have to move to a bigger company’s side of the argument.
Google seems to have learned no lesson yet in this case regarding its aggressive actions."
"As an example of Google’s growing power — and willingness to work with — you may recall Google’s Operation Room software suite that was developed out of the University of Maryland, where it took Google three weeks to get a small group of people “in” according to the company’s website (and of course, Google was eventually sued in a different venue). (In other words, if you don’t hear about a lawsuit, you’re not a legal entity.) In a blog post today for the company, Google’s corporate vice president of the Web, AdWords, Kevin O’Connor, shared some of Google’s efforts to “win” that lawsuit:
In this latest attempt, Google took out a “wizard” that would manage its response to the US government’s complaints against it, and it’s important to understand the scope for this case.
But not everyone can get a wizard for magic and learn how to act against a corporation when their life is threatened. And in that regard, Google’s move may have to be a bit more than that.
The wizard can help Google track any time there is a violation of the terms of service,” as O’Connor puts it in his blog post. “It’s not a matter of rolling into an area of legal peril, and unless we move quickly to mobilize against the threat of a false positive result, we’ll face a huge legal liability.”
It’s not always a matter of when, not if, that’s the case with Google. In this case, the company appears intent on violating the FTC Act, as O’Connor noted:
Google also has a clause in its privacy policy, which permits it to share anonymized information with outside parties. So if Google were to go out of its way to gather whatever information it could on Google users, it appears that there’s a big chance that would be used to protect Google users’ safety, as well as privacy. The problem is that the company is not transparent about this and the extent to which it collects data about users without consent.
Google does not share any details of the type of data it tracks, and the reason it doesn’t make any details of its data publicly

, a couple of the apps we’ve covered recently have also been trying to capitalize on this trend, with the iPhone app Clumsy Ninja a parody of both Clumsy Ninja and The Hunt For The Mummy that has a decidedly awful mission.
In an effort to outdo Clumsy Ninja and its ilk, app platform LaunchRock has teamed up with the Clumsy Ninja creator himself. Clumsy Ninja creator David Tischoff has stated that the startup plans to go direct to legal action against Clumsy Ninja in the U.S., and hopes to avoid the lengthy lawsuits and settlements required to remove or correct Clumsy Ninja apps, with Clumsy Ninja just a link away from any launch app.
Tischoff, meanwhile, says that Clumsy Ninja is probably going to eventually be removed or at least made illegal, as the app was originally intended as a satire on how to make a mess for you. (Clumsy Ninja, unfortunately, seems to take a very dark and cynical approach to the problem.)
But just because the app isn’t infringing on your copyright doesn’t mean you’ve been immune from the Clumsy Ninja clone. In Tischoff’s words, “Clumsy Ninja is nothing more or less than a one-trick-pony.” (Not the first time I’ve seen a Clumsy Ninja clone, but I’ll forgive Tischoff for my snarkiness.)
Clumsy Ninja creator David Tischoff had this to say, “The App Store is littered with these clones and many of them actually look quite silly or have been developed just to show off the ridiculousness of the app platform.”

Of course, if clones are making it in the App Store, it’s not entirely surprising. App-stores typically have to be more vigilant in checking out these trends and not only checking for copy-cats, but also of these clones, which can often feel downright silly or just plain weird. Some of the clones already out in the App Store look much more like their originals, which raises questions about whether they’ll live long enough to become genuinely harmful to the App Store, or at the very least have a healthy impact on the App Store’s ecosystem.

The Clumsy Ninja App Store is pretty cluttered this year, but it’s also a testament to how app stores are increasingly turning into places where publishers get to earn more money than their apps. Clumsy Ninja, for its part, seems to have been created more because they wanted to make an original app than because of the App Store’s approval process (as Tischoff put it, “Clumsy Ninja is designed to be a “clone”” for the App Store’s app store, a “market test”). App stores generally make apps that don’t infringe on apps that they approve for their own use, but if you look around, and even a few apps that don’t meet in this test a lot of apps are probably infringing on your copyright.

Clumsy Ninja also competes with other apps where Clumsy Ninja users try to earn as much as they can, including a Clumsy Ninja clone of The Hunt For The Mummy. It’s an unfortunate but cute situation, for a lot of apps to become popular is a bit of a hit. The App Store has become a real platform for mobile app discovery, and I’m sure there’s still a lot more to be done there. Apple’s App Store review team is probably going to be more interested in the future, as have its developers."
"It’s been a pretty busy last 24 hours for SnapCents, the ad tech startup/community that’s building a platform for buying and selling secondhand used cameras, books, magazines, fashion and other content. Today, the team is announcing that it has received a $3 million round of funding from a host of interesting players, including the founders of Povio, Angry Birds-ing up Paper Palzion ($2 million raised in 2012) and WimTmue, along with new investors S-Cubed Capital and U2 Vision. So, now this is a brand new product, and not the one at Google, either.
It’s easy to see that SnapCents’ value is in service within the wider SnapCents ecosystem and as a part of growing its footprint on the mobile web; the service runs on desktop desktop web, and now it’s mobile-first. Its platform also includes content for the ad world of brands, content for retailers to share imagery and video, and content for both customers and their clients for a wider range of items, across a number of verticals. This provides a pretty attractive revenue stream for the startup and, at a global level, it

 ”and it’s the same story we’re hearing from all of us. 
“We think our team has a lot to give back to the founders,” explains Lai at the beginning of the post. “But it’s also going to be a very big part of what we’re trying to do at Flisk.”
Flisk will launch a new product, called Flipsheet, in a couple of weeks, and will take on the challenge of keeping tabs on the top news and images in your stream. You can snag the new app here, or read more in the company’s blog."
"Foursquare is moving beyond its core check-in services to provide an option for the company to generate revenue off of those. Instead of a revenue generator through Sponsored Places, Flipping Dollars and in-app purchases people send to friends via text message, users are able to pay to get their check in via Paying by the Dollar app, as well as by filling in a form and using the web credit.
Foursquare was still working on finding ways of making money from the payments and ads it saw growing, but today’s news is pretty obvious. The company is offering credit, which, like credit card or credit card (for real), requires a customer to purchase goods on the site or download something – in that case, it’s the app itself, and not the restaurant or bar in the offline world. There are a few caveats to making sure the payments and purchases aren’t fraudulent, which is exactly why those integrations weren’t in place – like Flipsheet and its other integrations, the app can charge any charges, and be refunded.
There are several ways that this works (which are actually more difficult for those unfamiliar with Foursquare’s rules), and those involve removing users from the site altogether, and also allowing users to buy goods through the app without the credit the credit card in possession of the app. In any case, the most helpful thing, according to CEO Dennis Crowley, is choosing the payments method that works best for each user. To do this, Foursquare will take care of billing and shipping for the transactions, and other issues associated with it. (Users, who are a part of the service, can not initiate transactions or upload check-ins, but only those who have a check in the app will be able to make purchases and initiate them, and the payment, if approved, is processed as soon as the request is approved. This also means that the company will take care of credit and shipping costs, if charged.
For those unfamiliar, Foursquare’s app connects you with your Facebook friends, and then allows you to track your interactions across that relationship to determine if there are any real-world implications to a relationship – like, perhaps, a potential violation of privacy – or a potential breach of contract. But, of course, by removing one third of the transactions from the feed, Foursquare now has a better chance of making those products a money-generating endeavor, and a potentially more financially viable option for business.
One of the things it does this well is keep your check-ins to a minimum. On the desktop, Foursquare is all but black; on the web, the app is almost entirely white, with the exception of a few navigation boxes that allow users to check-in to bars and dive into a feed that are best for you. The company is now averaging about 500,000 check-ins per day in the U.S., with 80 percent hitting the service on the iOS platform, and the remainder in the Android and web editions. (Android users are in danger of a lot of these people not paying for the apps, but Foursquare can still charge the account if the app becomes popular and can be seen as an attractive alternative to Facebook if it can generate some growth in the near future.)
Foursquare says that now it has the largest referral network on the web, with more than 25 million check-ins on Android, and a half-million social interactions per month on the desktop. Its gross revenue, meanwhile has quadrupled since its inception, with the company reporting $175 million in gross revenue in 2011, and $70 million in gross merchandise value and gross bookings (GMV).
The company is not disclosing active users, and it does not break out downloads, either. But it does say that the vast majority of those who use the app to communicate with friends or family on the web, not apps, are spending five minutes per session and three hours per day. Flipping Dollars, which lets you make purchases via its in-app purchase feature, is now averaging over 2 million payments per month on Android, with 80 percent of that coming from the app itself. And the company says that the engagement rate on the app is 94

this, then, if Google’s Nexus is right around the corner, there will have to be a better way to discover and use Android devices in general.
Google already has a new Nexus TV set in the market, but it hasn’t unveiled one since the October deal on Google I/O. Now, we should see a release of a product that’s much more widely available at launch, if it’s available to consumers and could offer up compelling competitive value in the mobile marketplace, with a wide range of hardware inside the system, from powerful home security systems to better ways to control a smart home and more.
Google is also building out its own set of smart home services, using cloud data to connect connected devices. That includes a new mobile home assistant that could eventually even offer up the ability to monitor a certain variety of the various home appliances that you can buy today, so long as you trust Google to keep the appliances in good shape.
Google’s Android mobile platform, including Home and Gmail, will compete with iPhone, iPad and the web in markets where there’s already a degree of trust between the two companies. One of the more interesting and important upcoming moves that Google may make as a result of the deal with Nest is that it will try to bring the experience of using its services to iOS, in addition to Android. In addition to Nest, Android may also tie a better relationship with Google’s other products, including Nest monitoring, Nest Learning Thermostat, HomeKit and more.
Apple has also had a couple of interesting changes on the software front lately. The company released its updated iOS 8 and OS X Mavericks updates today in order to provide more personalization and enhancements to its mobile operating system. But that doesn’t include the ability to run mobile apps from the OS X itself – though this is something it does offer, and Nest’s support on iOS is quite useful, especially since many users don’t want to run their own apps on their phones while connected to the big screens of their tablet computers.
All these changes aside, Google is well positioned to grab more mobile experience by offering a mobile infrastructure that’s built specifically for using mobile devices like a smart thermostat and smart TV for Internet-level enterprise apps.
Android is also a better home platform than Apple’s iOS, but that platform has a slightly less high walled-gate potential compared to Windows Mobile, Macs and Linux. To wit, Google’s OS X Mavericks was made available and hosted on a PC (complete with a mouse, keyboard, etc.), that has been customized for running on mobile devices. It looks like the company is trying to find a better balance between iOS and Android, as it may use iOS to ship software or services to enterprise customers, while it still has the advantage of being developed for use on mobile devices."
"After some serious abuse of authority, the US Department of Housing and its Housing Commissioner Ed Yablek just announced that a $25 million settlement money has been provided to the victims, many of whom are victims of the abuse and exploitation. Some of these victims were even suspected of crimes, but the actual cases were dropped (after Apple filed the original complaint to the Houzz) after their records were reviewed by the Department of Housing. According to information released in late December, one of the top three abusers who committed major crimes was former mayor of New York City’s Prison to Prisoner of Ulster William Martby. In a press statement, Yablek noted that over 100,000 people from the community of 100,000 are affected by the crime, and the $25 million in settlement funds will go to several others that will be directly focused on the abuse.
The decision to close the case comes in the wake of a series of other lawsuits, which were dropped or were moved onto another court. The Department of Housing is still pursuing their legal actions, too, and in a phone interview, Yablek noted that “these victims are just a small sample of victims who are going to be supported by this settlement. They want to be able to tell people, ‘Hey, we can’t just look at this as the case of justice.'” In other words, let the lawsuit be the case instead of letting this specific case languish.
The settlement is not the first big settlement to come from the Department of Housing and the National Coalition for Human Rights, which were working together earlier this year to offer money to victims of discrimination, drug abuse, or other serious crime in the community which they cover. The funding will be taken as another tool in the larger ‘Make a Difference’ program. The first grant was a $10 million grant from the Lines Act to a group of women who had been abused and neglected

in of this, we don’t want to provide a service provider with content to be consumed outside of its own walled garden where the copyright regime continues to ramp up.”
At the same time, he’s been speaking up about the need for broader reforms — both to reformat the legal regime and also to provide access for people in the third-party service markets. He doesn’t make the argument, of course, that an uncrackable, peerless service can be a necessary evil in the current legal regime.
It is certainly true that there is a need for reform. We need to get to the point where that will be the most practical thing to do.
It is very apparent. Why did the French court order today’s case not resolve the issue of access over the past five months, but that isn’t to be blamed solely for the French government — it’s also possible that the European Commission, as well as the local partners will need to step in and help restore a lawless Europe.
The truth is there is no doubt in Europe’s EU, as there is in the United States, there will be an order to be overturned.
And yet, the new European law — which, of course, is also subject to debate and challenge, and it’s likely that we’ll see a different type of outcome.
The fact is many in Europe believe it needs to reform and, again, while the right now will probably come out on the European side, the question will be when it will come to pass. The last way will be to wait before the EU can reach to reach a resolution, because a partial solution and solution may be an illusion in the current state of European law.
There remains a chance in the current legal regime, which has allowed the current legal regime to play out, that it will come to an end. And if you’re in the market to do so, you can help.
You can help. You can visit the European Parliament here."
"Another sign of how the consumer demand for services in Europe is growing up, but with the continent yet to become a powerhouse of internet companies, one of the main reasons is because of the growing use of smartphones. Today the startup community organization WebProx has released data that will show which services are driving use of phones more. It will also list the most popular tech services for the region. This new data was uncovered in a recent blog of WebProx by founder and CEO of webprox.com, Paulo Campalle, who writes that the traffic on websites for websites in Europe is “skyrocketing.” It will include a list for the top web service for Google’s European division.
The publication is timed to coincide with news of Google’s first IPO today, when the search behemoth said it plans to beat public investor expectations.
While some say that this will be a time when the company underwrites better products, Campalle notes that Google has been working on new products since 2012, just about at the right time. But, with consumer demand for services in the region going, it is also time to move faster.
“The fact is that the consumer is demanding more and better services,” he writes. “Google has more time to find the answers to the questions above and we just have more time, we just can’t afford to add new features and functions to our product plan every five minutes.”
For example, Google’s most popular tech product in Europe is its search algorithm. Since 2012, the company has said that it has helped drive a new 280,000-user high end monthly active users for all six months, with over half of these coming from the U.S. and the U.K.'s top web services. Google’s search engine for this period, for comparison, made 8 million searches (most of them from the U.K.). And Google’s search engine for other products has made 15 million clicks, and Google has helped drive 150,000 websites around the world and has helped drive over 15 million clickable pages. 
The search engines have also been helping drive traffic to sites, but one is a different beast: mobile. There have been three big developments that have taken place over their weeks — Twitter (its acquisition of WhatsApp), Microsoft’s Office 365 and its acquisition of LinkedIn.

But why will consumer demand have been so strong at Google: Facebook, Twitter and others also all saw strong growth in traffic. Facebook traffic was particularly strong in Sweden and Germany and the U.K. — in fact, it accounted for over half of all searches in

In a blog post titled “This blog post isn’t a new idea,” Zuckerberg wrote that the decision to bring Facebook for Android “is not a decision we took lightly.” He also noted that Android has now become the dominant smartphone OS in 100 countries. The company has just released the most recent version of Android 4.3. He concludes the post by saying that he likes being an Android guy: “At Facebook we’re always looking to do things bigger, but this is one area we’re focused on.”"
"The U.K. government has issued a declaration that it will be banning the Muslim Brotherhood — a European-led organization in a campaign against the government’s new surveillance powers, a move the government says reflects its determination to protect national security.
The government’s effort to ban the group, a member of the Quraş-headquartered, has generated debunking concern about the dangers of extremist extremists encouraging suspected terrorist attacks.
But it is also making a critical point about the potential for a ban on extremist groups — which are thought be the main threat to Western security at the moment — and arguing that the process of identifying and banning groups is inefficient and does not address the fundamental problem.
The government is not clear about whether the group in question will be banned or not. But in a statement it said: “The government of the day’s media reports that the group, the Muslim Brotherhood, has been banned in Turkey but has not been able to be tracked in any meaningful way.”
The announcement says the government is “aggressively dealing with this issue” to identify and ban any groups — including groups that “promise to destroy”, as the statement goes — so that they can “more fully participate in the lawful activities of the State”. It’s only the membership of the groups that will be banned who are not eligible to participate in “political life”.
The government is also willing to put the blame for allowing the group's members to participate in political life on the shoulders of ISC, the intelligence agency that recently declassified the MP3 tapes that were released, after ruling them out of public play last year.
The intelligence agency has previously said it wants information about groups that have “promised to disrupt” the official and legal roles in gathering intelligence. Earlier this month it also ruled out the group in question having any ‘political’ rights at all. But, according to documents released earlier, it had been monitoring the group via the BT cable to “minimize its activities and capabilities”, so any information gathered should not have any “political value.”
The intelligence agency describes a situation where the group in question will be required to be “propositioning to the [UK] intelligence community” — which it describes as being the “only lawful way” to “know and prevent the group’s activities”.
In another part of the declaration its government will be “establishing or strengthening the surveillance capabilities of the intelligence agencies” to improve the capacity of these agencies, which will “continue to improve the capability and quality of those agencies”.
The government is also appointing two independent reviewers to investigate the government’s assurances on the assurance that the monitoring operation will only be able to detect the threat group’s activity, and never use it as a way to engage with them — as one of the independent reviewers, QC David Anderson, has put it at the time.
“The government’s commitment to ensuring the surveillance capability be brought to bear for use only in cases where the threat group’s activities are of potential concern does not adequately protect the public from the risk, risk and risk of its activities to democratic society,” it added.
The government has not yet specified any submission measures for monitoring the group but the independent review of Section 94 in its U.K. domestic policing (DPC) report notes it’s ‘not clear whether a ‘minister’ or senior associate would be the designated “senior advisor” or senior associate managing director, with the latter described as a “managing director” in its own words.
But it does specify that its senior advisor “must be senior and appropriate” — suggesting in fact that’s why it’s naming both a senior advisor and

 a startup, which is probably the biggest problem with those companies.
However, the problem with many, if not most, competitors is that they focus on the big platforms like Facebook, Google and now Twitter. If you want to compete in any kind of social network style, you’re going to have to find your own niche somewhere on those platforms. That doesn’t make sense from an app perspective. Meanwhile, Twitter is much closer to your core social purpose — connecting with people you’re friends with around the world.
But it seems like the new guys in this space are starting to realize that it’s more about the content in their apps rather than the people in their social networks when it comes to actually achieving results. That in fact, many of the companies mentioned above likely haven’t even realized that, and may have even been focusing on user engagement before trying to do any social media engagement, instead.
That said, it’s hard to find a good balance in a landscape where the social media and social media consumption is very much the same. And when it comes to user engagement, Facebook probably isn’t going after that group…yet.
In other news, Alfred, a French startup, recently became the fastest-growing French social network."
"Google+ finally reached 50 million users, nearly quadrupling its reach in the past year. Today, Facebook and LinkedIn announced their first major technical milestone: 50 million unique users of its social networking platform.
Facebook also made it possible to translate your most recent status update into another language. All three apps now support one of the most popular keyboard features of Google+.
Google+ only had 4.5 million monthly active users at the beginning of August but this milestone was missing from the official stats. This fact should make Google+ feel more like the most popular mobile social network, and Facebook the more like a true social network. And the biggest competitor: Google+.
Update: Google’s new stat also seems to be based on the users who tried LinkedIn’s “sign in with Twitter” feature where users can automatically follow and enter their current credentials when they sign up for an account.
Facebook has the most loyal users, with 35 million monthly active users, but it’s still not clear when the most active users were using it. Google+ has more active users but it’s still not clear that the users who check it out are spending more on it. Still, it’s clear that Google+ represents something of a new kind of social network, and the fact that Facebook has now reached 50 million seems in that direction."
"Google has now acquired the UK’s Tech Stars program for £150,000. The program, which also serves as a mentor service for budding entrepreneurs, previously took place in partnership with UK accelerator Springboard — which had programs and projects available for a month, a year, or five weeks of mentoring.
TechStars London, which was founded by Springboard founders Andrew Stone, Jon Bradford, and Shannon Parr, said the new partnership will be run from April 20 to April 23, 2012. The program’s main goal was for budding entrepreneurs to “get the most out of themselves” — and also help others in their careers.
Today TechStars confirmed the news, adding that it has passed the 50 million user milestone (note that we have updated the article to correct this).
“Now, we’re the world’s first and only TechStars-powered accelerator,” said Stone in a statement. “We’re pleased to have worked with our TechStars team to create this partnership, which will strengthen our position in Europe for the next five years.”
Stone, who is founder and CEO of tech recruitment company Robotunicorn also counts the Rovio and Angry Birds creator Rovio (to name just a few companions) as a mentor, told TechCrunch that he believes the “market-leading” global network can only reach 50 million users.
However, he also notes that many of the existing Tech Stars ‘start of the world’ programs are failing — that many are founded by people of similar or connected backgrounds (ie, many Tech Stars alumni). “I do think that the world we live in will only get smaller in the future,” he said, noting that he thinks the “global opportunity is getting bigger”. “And the need for people of different backgrounds to have meaningful growth is growing more rapidly than the need for the UK to ever get any meaningful number.” 
At the same time, he said the UK needs to build out “more opportunities for talent mobility”. “We’re also starting to see companies from Europe start to really shine,�

 eventually, a device like the Pebble could have the potential to significantly help democratize gaming.
“It’s one of those hardware things that people who aren’t really comfortable with technology say ‘holla!’” said Palmer. “We’ve been chasing that market for a long time. I think this will be the device that we get to market.”
With that new toy, he said the team will be launching an internal development kit that offers some basic building blocks for game development with one or more external expansion packs, but we’ll not know what that will look like until the startup has a chance to put those prototypes to a real test.
This might be a big first step, but there’s also a plan for the team to make an e-commerce play in early 2015 and perhaps even get there before the initial wave of hardware launches. A gaming ecosystem like this one obviously lends itself to both early and post-launch phases, but Palmer hints that it’s still looking to see just how well that will work on real hardware and a few different types of people. On that note, he’s more pleased with the early results so far than he is with anything that’s developed so far and his team looks to be moving fast on to the next phase. It’s still a hard pill to swallow for someone to finally step into that mix, but a small business that’s looking to get its game out there quickly could be a win for everyone."
"A year ago, TechCrunch held the first TC Meetup in Tel Aviv, but ended it in Boston. The event was a roaring success, with over 100 RSVPs, a huge turn in attendance, and a fantastic after-parties bar and music that made the experience even better.

"As a Romanian Roman Catholic theologian, I find it pretty boring to write about religion in a post like this. I know it’s just about religion, but the word religion is hardly ever in my vocabulary. When religion is something that I have to get my heart in, there is a certain sadness attached. Sometimes when someone shares something religious on Facebook, it can seem to spark a conversation inside me. Sometimes it’s not. And sometimes, it just feels sad or raw on my heart. That’s why Facebook introduced the topic into its new version yesterday with the concept of “religions.” So how does it work? There is also a bit of a learning component to it, of course. Users will get to see the differences and definitions between different religions.
I asked Facebook to clarify the product to some extent when we first covered this last month’s “Religions” rollout. The company had to clarify that it was not referring to the “religions

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 brating is a huge part of the social network, but now with a new feature that lets you select which of their posts you want shared, you can tap “Share to Post Sharing” or tap “Add to Read List.” On mobile post sharing could seem a little different here:
I tested out the app on the iPhone 5 over three weeks ago, and in those moments when my own social network was growing, I would send photos back to Facebook and then post those back to Instagram. Now, all I have to do is tweet from Twitter.
The difference with how the iPhone app works is it’s one that has really taken off in recent months on Android, where users would have liked it the way it did back for Windows Phone, where in earlier days it was often only available on Apple’s iPad devices.
What this new option does is enable users to share content with a single tap. As in, a phone call. This is not a new feature, but one that is a bit more seamless. It’s a feature that Apple is finally catching up to Android and even catching up to Windows Phone in developing countries where SMS is all but limited or absent.
For example, my father is an auto shop owner, but I occasionally have to deal with calling after he’s done a test run. With the new feature, I can simply tap “Share to Call” at the top of the Camera app, which opens the call screen.
The other new features is a bit more subtle, but are also a result of how Apple is tackling social networking on its handsets.
The first of these is “Call It Reading.” It is, as the name suggests, for Twitter to capture tweets when they are being read on the device. When tapped, this new feature opens a browser within iTunes to retrieve tweets. You can tap on any tweet to look it up before typing, and tap “Retweet” to tweet back to Twitter at someone. After all, you don’t want to have to tap “Retweet” with a tweet: you want to tap from the top of your screen. This is something that is probably only useful to those with long-form tweets to read.
Apple is also doing something else here, as you can imagine from the launch notes of the iPhone app, the company notes:
And you can read more about both of these features here.

And you can find this feature here, here and here, and check out the documentation here."

"Here we are! Our favorite tech conference of the year should have a heck of a time in September, and here we are! But who could I talk with? This guy has a very interesting perspective on the whole situation, as well as his thoughts and feelings on the growing noise of the tech scene, and what kind of tech bubble should we be concerned about.
It should be pretty easy for a veteran journalist to get into this whole thing. But that’s not how I am writing this so it will be interesting to watch.
We discuss all of the top things happening in a big tech bubble, including Google Glass, Android and iOS 7, Oculus Rift, and all of the things you wouldn’t necessarily consider significant tech stories.
In terms of my predictions for the conference, I’d say a bunch of things including the fact that we’ll see a lot of new phones, the Google TV thing, and possibly the first hardware-driven social network in a while.
The show runs every Tuesday at 6pm on Sirius XM Insight 121. For the rest of the year, tune in on the SiriusXM Connections channel in the live area at 6pm ET with Mark Levin live.
In addition, follow along as we discuss the latest in tech related media and the general excitement surrounding the tech industry.

"If you want to know when your mobile app is doing very well one is the obvious answer. But where the magic happens if you only have a couple hundred users and the app crashes (and dies) everytime and then comes back online is something that hasn’t yet been solved. You are going to eventually get an answer.

a revenue growth rate.
In terms of the partnerships segment, the company has partnerships with companies including TMobile, Clear and Sprint, as well as with others, including HTC, which it says is bringing “a range of benefits that no other global player has”, through its new HTC One MVNO partnership.
The question for Fonera, however, is how it will make money this business, after it’s too early to tell.
“We are already profitable and growing quickly,” said Draper. “It is a logical step to help grow and continue to build these great businesses. Our focus is on building new great products, expanding the business and helping to deliver quality service and exceptional customer service to consumers. With this additional capital it gives us the ability to invest in our market and technology infrastructure to do that, as well as expand our marketing and advertising presence into new regions.”
Draper added that he’s currently looking towards “new financing options” in light of the growth, which he said in early 2013, “was the most exciting quarter we’ve ever had.”
Other developments: An updated app, and an updated mobile app for kids, are launching now."
"Polaroid, one of the many startups trying to make building websites and apps easier for developers with mobile apps to find, has raised $2.4 million in a round led by Greylock, with participation in by Accel. This adds to the $1 million Atomico invested in the company in April 2012 — its previous investors include Greylock, Accel and others — and to a list of some of Silicon Valley’s best new angels.   Among other things, the investment and strategic partnership with Atomico will give Polaroid a platform for developers to build apps in the cloud on whatever device they are working on with Polaroid itself links back to, as well as provide developers with support, and possibly monetization.
The company says it has already delivered over 1 million users on its platform, and is growing by adding new markets and customers “in the coming months.” Its web and native SDKs now span a range of apps in “every major” countries including Europe, the U.S., Mexico, the Middle East, and South Korea, and are going live on the platform from its web store beginning this week (the web site currently uses a Flash-based version of the web interface).
The web and its native SDKs, meanwhile, should mean better coverage for the thousands of apps they will be helping to build.  “In the U.S., we already have several big-name clients on our platform, including Sparky the Musical School, Fruit Club and Fantasia School,” says Naval Ravikant.  “But the best-known application is Facebook and for that, they will bring more apps up and running in the next few months.”  In addition to offering Atomico a partner company of sorts, it will also help in the following:
Co-founders, Polaroid Co-founder and CEO Brian Chlor and CTO Videez Ravikant, also sit on the board of Polaroid, as well as are participating in their startup of the month. This brings them in for what is a modest equity stake."
"AOL is suing Google, claiming the Internet service is a search platform, not a mobile platform.
This is a very small and brief development, but is worth reading because there is some interesting content on the side.  It is not the first time that AOL has made something up. It’s been the basis of a case against Twitter, a case against Yahoo. And Google, a large business.
Here’s the case specifically:
There’s also the case that AOL is looking for a judge. But it seems to be that the judge will not take the case, and the court will not take the case. You have to wonder whether the judge is getting paid and whether AOL will be able to use the court to win. If not, there is nothing much for the judge to do in this case.
There are other possibilities. For example, AOL and Google could decide to go through the court in the court that was based in San Francisco. And I’ve written about this before. In terms of more details, the question is whether AOL is looking for a judge.  The question is whether a judge could consider taking the case to an appellate court. In that case, there are a few hurdles to winning.
But the primary hurdle to any legal action against AOL would appear to be the agreement AOL made with Google in February. That agreement essentially provided a framework to help

To improve its performance over a larger sample size, the device offers a new design that includes a “force touch” technology, for an additional $99.99. It also gives iPhone 6 Plus access to the camera functions found on other camera phones, including capturing video, by offering force touch on the device and the addition of three new camera lens options, says Apple.
Apple“can use these sensors simultaneously to capture video, photo and video and it also adds a new, exciting option to take picture and video,” explains Macbook Pro Chief Innovation Officer Frank Wu, speaking at the press event. “We have optimized a lot of the aspects of photo and video that haven’t been totally successful at the time with the traditional ‘take two photo’ approach, and so we decided to change to a “photograph” by adding two new types of photo sensors, force touch (i.e., squeezing) and light capture (i.e., the ability to capture video and video using light rather than otherwise).

Wu says that for the first time, Apple has brought photographic experience (and also photos) to its mobile devices, taking cues from how users have been gesturing for ages. “That’s really been a fundamental change,” he argues to TechCrunch. “[Apple] hasn’t had a device that connects all of these things in one place all the way since the Macintosh.”"
"The battle for your life continues today between Amazon and Apple as Echo emerges on Android. Today, at its WWDC event, the company announced to new buyers that Echo has moved to a supported version of Google’s new mobile operating system.
The move marks a significant shift for Echo customers, as the company makes no mention of its Android app.
According to sources, the update will include a brand new app, Alexa, for the mobile platform. Apple has agreed to work with its third-party app partners on the update, Amazon confirmed, and they’ll be rolling it out across all their devices first.
The update means people who bought Echo a year ago are now able to enjoy the benefits of the latest Android OS on their device without having to sideload software from the Google App Store. The update will also include Siri support for the Android lock screen, Amazon’s Head of iOS Devices Alex MacNeil showed off on stage today.
As expected, Amazon released an update to its iPhone and iPad devices today. It takes advantage of the new features of iOS 7, the company noted, and supports the app from your phone.

On the Apple side, the company remains mum about the new update, so we’ll have to wait and see which apps deliver what they were promising in the Apple Watch App Store to arrive, but Apple hasn’t been shy about letting Apple’s TV be a powerful remote that can provide voice control and commandeer functionality.
Android users can also now get notifications, and can finally tap the Notification Center to get more info about their apps. Apple will also support third-party developers of Siri apps to add a third-party app to its main OS.
In other news, Amazon today announced a partnership with HBO Go, allowing users to read the shows of HBO at their homes. It also offers free streaming with the Roku Streaming Stick and an Amazon Prime subscription option.
Apple will be expanding its Prime TV lineup in the coming months with new shows and new episodes as it competes with Amazon for more of a pure audio subscription service. And then, for now, the company is just a few steps down from its streaming service, which launched with a decent, but relatively sparse lineup. With the new update, they’ll be offering streaming and storage options, but there’s no new hardware to be found, nor will there be a large catalog of shows on the platform.
Apple has a massive head start with its streaming service, and has been aggressively building its own native iOS operating system features as a result. With the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, Apple built the streaming service into every new iPhone, and it makes perfect sense this week to launch Apple’s new streaming service."
"Apple’s iPhone 6 has now been confirmed for more than a week, but some people have been holding out for longer than that. And they’re now getting those early bird pricing updates. Just in time for the launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus on Thursday, 3 new iPhones will be available by Apple for Apple’s regular price of $649 each for two months.
The 2GB model of iPhone will be available on November 23, but the 12-month service will get a $100 discount in time. And the 6 and 6 Plus will both get cheaper than the 4-inch

 and he notes that the startup is “currently growing its headcount at a decent clip and has seen steady annual growth since we launched.” He believes that there is still room to expand, too — namely the scope of the product — and that its ambitions have now expanded beyond the company’s vision itself and will continue as it looks to compete in other markets that are now saturated in the way that cloud-based apps have been able to do for their clients and to compete with other companies in different categories.
It will not be easy for the small startup that has yet to become profitable to compete with giants that have the resources to invest in marketing, hiring and, he says, to scale their own business. But he says the team is planning to try to win through service to small companies so that it is able to expand, and thus fund the business through additional growth: while it has had small customers, with 150,000 downloads and 40,000 on-demand quotes, it plans to be able to offer a ”very similar,” he says. But the market for cloud services remains large and is still growing, which is why it’s decided to invest in a new product and in acquiring some of the team to help it along its way.
“Cloud services today are extremely fragmented. With our acquisition of a company, we are able to add a more unified platform for our cloud software services into the same markets that we will now be supporting. We will continue to expand beyond AWS and Azure and offer other services-integrated into that,” he says.
“Our customers, including enterprises, will appreciate the flexibility and scalability that will be provided through our management software and sales services. This will help ease the transition from using a cloud to using our services,” he says.
It’s also interesting to note that the other companies it acqui-hired also have a business focused on building apps. CloudCredo and Cognito, both backed by the firm FundersClub — which invests in many of the market’s large-scale companies — make mobile apps to monitor your health and fitness. CloudApp in the last year has seen some $12 million in funding. While CloudCredo, a competitor, had already been profitable with its “health monitoring” functions, CloudCredo has now been profitable for five to six months. The two companies use a mixture of subscription and freemium models while CloudCredo and CloudDune will also offer paid services, and at times in the past, the plan to charge for their Premium service on the subscription service. CloudCredo has raised an undisclosed amount of angel funding from a number of investors, and it has plans to continue expanding the size of CloudCredo’s budget over the next year, he notes."
"Tapping into the potential of online gaming, which is poised to become the biggest and most valuable area of the digital world, ・mechanical collaboration site for gamers, ・Rocket Jump has come up with a way for its users to get together and play a shared game in a private space. ・RocketJump is not the first site that has been around for years, but it’s the one that has really taken off to this point, as users on its site have played over 4,000 games together in the last month alone.
A recent feature, called “Jump off the board,” allows a group of people to play a game together in a shared place, which not only includes people, but also other equipment — both from the perspective of a player and that of others. In other words, if a group of developers and designers are collaborating on a 3D game, they also have access to a fully-accessible space. 

The site is now open to the public (with plans to bring it to other platforms and devices) and is in private beta, and founder and CEO Nick Eronovich hopes to see other social networks start on its site before other networks do.  (“I’m kind of tired of being ‘tied up’ by a game we have built with a bunch of people,” he told me in an email.)  It recently raised a $7 million round.
Eronovich started out as a game developer, and found that when he and company co-founder Alex Tikhman worked with Rocket Jump, they took turns making decisions — “What are we going to do with the company?” The answer was, in part due to the limitations of the game.  “What it really is was that we are gamers ourselves, and we’ve all been,” Eronovich says.
As for how Rocket Jump is growing, and how it might potentially be monetizing it? Eronovich says that he sees potential in the platform as “an independent business,” as well as

 as its flagship market leader.
The company’s new CEO, J.P. Morgan Stanley, said when I talked to him last week that Mobile Discovery’s growth has resulted in a 200 percent year-on-year increase in the company’s bookings—and its average order value has grown from $2.5 to $3. With that said, mobile-only apps are by nature of an app that relies on the use of the web. While many consumers today, like many consumers worldwide, rely on smartphones to search for things like restaurants before calling for a particular item, mobile has had to become a more traditional search mechanism, making the traditional desktop less practical for this kind of use.
While this may not be quite as exciting as a one-click ad from Google or Facebook (or a business’ other new acquisition, it seems), mobile is a more compelling option for the more engaged—and more often hungry—consumer. In mobile, where the app uses natural language processing (NLP) to allow you—and most likely your friends - — to get the information needed to buy the product before you even go to the checkout screen.
Now, it has to be said, how great is Mobile Discovery’s mobile apps? Well, in their first week of the business going live, the company claims 1.1 million downloads across 175 countries. This is certainly impressive considering that, in a couple of weeks, the iPhone became the No. 1 loyalty app, according to comScore.
This new funding round, led by Insight Venture Partners (IVP) and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB), brings Mobile Discovery’s total funding to $9 million.
I spoke with CEO Paul Fisher earlier this month after Mobile Discovery’s big launch across six continents, adding to its previous funding from previous backers Eric Schmidt’s TomorrowVentures and Google Ventures. (As with many of its launch partners, the company is also unveiling the first international integration.)
To illustrate the growth of mobile in Asia, Fisher says Asia on average accounts for a third of North America’s “market leaders”, and is growing faster than Europe; he also tells me that in Asia, “mobile is 50 percent of the search.”
As for why he believes Mobile Discovery’s new push on mobile is smart, I’m told that he believes mobile-only companies to which a smartphone user already has enough on their books now need to become more creative when it comes to their mobile strategy.
“There are still way too many very successful consumer products on the market today without any kind of meaningful mobile business,” Fisher says, citing companies like Zynga that have become more successful “product-oriented” — in their own words — instead of mobile-only. “And so this new strategy for Mobile Discovery takes advantage of mobile but doesn’t try and create all the “apps” for your customers.”
As part of the news, Mobile Discovery is also expanding its mobile platform — and its app list — by buying Jungle Mobile, Singapore-headquartered from Google, which also offers its own hotel search service (and no, not Google’s, but yours). Jungle now claims 250 million web page views per month, while Jungle Mobile’s app has been downloaded more than one billion times."
"The UK is not alone in considering rolling out legislation (possibly with help from others) to allow Uber to start showing ads — it is already in France.
The bill is called France’s Open Road Traffic Management Bill, and it should be adopted in early 2017. In the meanwhile, Uber will continue to wait for the law to be adopted in other countries, such as the U.S., where it is also facing a nationwide vote on Uber’s safety.
“While we’re waiting for the final step, we will continue to work closely with other industry players to ensure that we continue to be able to compete in France,” Uber France CEO and co-founder Garrett Graves told me.
He also noted that Uber doesn’t have its own data for the bill yet, but he said the company plans to gather it within the next few months.
“This is a very technical bill,” the bill says. “When we look at how the industry works in Europe, we want to understand both across the whole industry as well as within the ecosystem. We will be able to make it more transparent and transparent as soon as we can.”
The bill was first announced by Transport Minister Maëlle Gazzac saying that she would propose the bill to the French government in the coming days. It has just happened to pass and the executive bodies of the two technical divisions that are in the driving seat — Transportation Uber and

The New York, San Francisco, and London locations now have a dedicated platform to find and connect with other tech startups from around The world, with special attention to startups in other cities.
The “Seed” initiative covers a range of categories (including business, product, media, enterprise, angel, business development, and even government), where each section shows not only how much funding someone has lined up, but also where they’re working on their pitches, events and so on. (We recently launched an enterprise section, too.)
The idea, the company says, is to give the public “a place where they can find a company that matches their goals – regardless of the size or technology,” explains Reed. He notes, too, that the platform isn’t just for those who’ve raised money – there are regular meetings where entrepreneurs discuss the business aspect of pitching. And there are events where the funding community comes together, he says. 
However, the content on PitchIt may end up being less about pitching that’s actually interesting to other entrepreneurs, and more so about fundraising, which is a different game. What PitchIt does is connect with the people and their networks to help with the following:
The company also provides regular emails to a list of those it believes are likely to be interested in your startup, including offering a brief description along with links that would appear on the pitch’s own web page.
“We call this a PitchIt-For-X,” Reed says. “We want to help you think about what’s available to you, and we’re doing that with the PitchIt-For-X ecosystem that we’re talking about.”
The program is free to those who raise money, but will be charged when the startup hits a certain milestone, like a funding milestone or exits. It’s also free for those who sell direct to brands on a paid subscription plan.
Today, PitchIt is expanding to include free web hosting and email marketing, as well as an iPhone app. The company is also adding some tools for its in-house curation, which includes features like creating customized lists of deals, deals that others can subscribe to from the App Store, as well as an integrated pitch editor, which lets users select the most important pitches from the beginning to make their own selections. (“It’s hard to find the right pitch,” Reed notes.)
Other free features include Google+ authentication, and the option to pay $10/month or $20/year to get more than five people."
"BuddingBerry has been one of the pioneers in the Internet of Things sector. Now with more than 30,000 pieces of hardware now in production, the Swedish startup wants to take the next step in building a platform that will help other developers leverage its data to build even more accurate and accessible products. This morning the company is announcing a new partnership that enables developers to integrate BBM into their applications, something that will allow them to create new applications on top of the messaging service.
BBM for iOS and Android will initially be limited to iPhone apps, but support for BlackBerry devices is in the pipeline. That means there will be an app for Blackberry to add voice and messaging capabilities to their new platform, and, in turn, access to existing Blackberry applications which include BBM contacts, location services, BBM voice, and BBM links.
BlackBerry is using the app platform to leverage its existing data relationships with developers, and also to build new functionality that it can launch to extend its smartphone capabilities in new ways.
For example, with the BBM iPhone app, the company is allowing users to integrate their BBM contacts – email addresses in this case – directly into their mail clients, which can then be sent out over BBM to contacts. That means you can chat while you send a BBM request from an Android phone, as well as send a request for the same app that’s been most recently highlighted on iOS. It’s the “Messaging layer where the apps exist, not ‘super’ apps,” as Alexis Oakes of the company explains to today’s announcement.
For mobile developers who are looking to use BBM on their own applications, existing clients include Netflix, HBO GO, Hulu Plus, Pandora, Evernote, and Netflix. A new partnership between Microsoft and Roku is set to launch this week, which will let BBM link to the entertainment platform on Google’s Android smart TV platform, which is available for Google’s mobile platform. BBM for Roku, then, will be added to that list. The company says that developers have been waiting to partner with the platform before it launches for proper apps, but now they have to wait.
BBM is a great application to look at, in spite of

int are, by the way, on a journey as far as the Internet of Things.
There is nothing to be said about this.

As it stands, the Raspberry Pi micro-computer is an interesting concept and has the potential to improve the lives of millions of people every day. The team behind the Pi have had a brilliant mission to build a low cost micro-computer that can replace the mainframe when it cannot, and with a few cheap micro-cams to spy on the people in their homes.
“We’re not looking at these devices as a consumer,” says Pi founder and CEO, Eben Upton, in an interview. “They are for fun, there are no computing devices that cheap or easy to get,” he says. This is about “fun, little electronics and a really geeky vision of what can be done, or the little that will work.”
Pebble’s sensors are on display, and can include up to five different types of sensors, from ultrasonic for security purposes, to temperature and humidity measures, air quality. The sensors, called ‘sensors, can be used to measure things like temperature of home air, humidity in the home and energy consumption. It uses a low powered base station to track these things and is able to monitor individual sensor readings of more than 40 different types and in different sizes of home environments.
The sensors go on sale at the UK low-cost electronics retailer Argos for £200, priced at £65, and at Amazon for £50 more. There are currently two kinds in the Pi store; the 1/6/16 sensor model ($250), which gives away sensors for free, and the larger full-time cost of $50,000, which includes all the extra features from the first model plus other cool stuff that comes bundled in. It also includes air conditioners, which I didn’t find particularly interesting at first glance.
“At the same price as a lot of things today you get into the whole ‘smart home’ segment of everything it costs you $99 to $109 from Amazon or the Amazon hardware store,” Upton says of what the product offers. When asked if it can do some of the things that we might hope can be done with an IoT device, Upton says, “Yes, absolutely.”
What’s not quite there, of course, is really just the opportunity.
“We have the technology from the very start but it won’t be possible to do a great deal of it in one of the hardware shops we have found in the U.K. just because of the limitations of the space. Most of the time the product is expensive to develop, and when it does come at time the price will be too expensive to compete with the same quality as we are hoping for,” Upton says.
It’s an ideal position to see Pi in. It could be used to build the next great connected home device, something that is a leap forward in what the average person would expect from a hardware startup.
“If you think about the way that most hardware companies today is making a device that connects at the scale that [the Raspberry Pi and the new Amazon sensor] has, and just how much more powerful it offers to us,” Upton says. But, he points out that while IoT companies make a lot of devices, they’re still “only a part of the solution with a limited quantity of IoT available.”"
"It’s an interesting time to be in a gadget startup: “The iPad Air is a radical departure from the product we have launched before, and our vision for making a truly disruptive impact in retail,” said Jeff Bezos at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2016. I don’t think anyone can argue with that.
Amazon didn’t have any retail presence at Disrupt last year because it wasn’t focused on gadgets at that time. But that all changed in this year with the unveiling of the device on Monday.
Even Bezos, who said that he really wants to see “what the consumer wants to have” and not just a gadget, admitted that there was a different kind of product he wanted to build that is a great shopping experience while also going to work. Plus, he said that he can have a number of customers to sell it to.
With the release of the iPad, Amazon also released some more details, including some of its own research:
“We’re on a mission to be the ‘Amazon of everything,” he said. With the Apple Watch and Google’s Pixel 2 (“it’s always nice to see how things evolve in an Apple and Google product launch that will push the device as it is”), it became clear that Amazon now “can do a

 Knight for the acquisition.
Roughly a year ago, Overnier co-founder and CEO, Andrew Smith, told TechCrunch an unnamed company that is in the ‘data warehousing category’, and specifically said they have seen significant acquisition demand from outside the UK, has made a statement to TechCrunch describing a company (he did not name the company) that he says can offer ‘the best solution for solving data problems in the data warehousing space’.
Last month we reported the first signs of a bigger move towards data management services, with big names like Microsoft signing up as customers.
Overnier, which previously had its own data management business (which we’ve also been covering), was incubated at the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign and joined HP in 2006. It was backed by a syndicate of private investors, including Peter Costin and John French and an undisclosed round from Vanguard Capital, which closed in 2012.
The company has said it will use new data management platform the company built with Hewlett Packard to help find further customers, following the sale of its personal data management services (which includes processing of medical data) to Dell) through HP. The deal is expected to close around this month, according to the statement.
The deal for this latest round came in time, with the deal in the works long before the HP acquisition, and the deal has a potential value for investors that can be as high as $4.2 billion.
But even as a company that built a business with data management and search tools, Overnier was not immune to competition in the market. In fact, from the start, HP has been trying to build the next generation of business products around the enterprise, partnering with and investing in companies that compete with Overnier’s offerings in business applications for the workplace, and in services that help them do those kinds of things.
A spokesperson from HP, for example, declined to comment."
"For the fourth year straight, we’ve all been given an ice bucket with a lot of water to fill. Our hearts will be pounding at all the moment, as we can only hope that we’ll all be able to survive for a week more.
I hope that this will be a fun week. What do you hope? I really hope I’ll be able to get a lot of food, but I would also just really like to stay healthy. We can’t be on the internet (we get too many weirdos anyway) and we can’t stay on the internet for long. What do we try to do? Who else would we try?
I think it’ll have a lot of interesting discussion. Let us know what you think. Please be a part of our audience at the next 8 AM PT (8 PM ET) when we are announcing the news. It’s important that we have everyone involved."
"While you wait for your new laptop and tablet, what do you do while you’re at your desk? Here’s a quick, easy way to put an end to that awkwardness. When you wake up, put on the news (if you’re up for that) and open Word and Twitter (if you already have it installed on your phone).
Now, as an aside, let’s be honest: The Macbook Air is an insanely expensive piece of kit.
For those of you who haven’t already bought one (I’ve had one since the beginning of time), it is a true, 4.9-inch, high-resolution MacBook Pro that has a retina display a 7-megapixel webcam, and has an Intel Haswell processor (which is the same as the one you would get from the high-end notebook). You can also transfer files — the default file type is Adobe Lightroom 2.
You can also browse the web through an accompanying browser (which is a nice touch, as you can see in the screenshot below).
I’ve been using the Macbook to connect to the Internet for a while now. I’ve been using it pretty much as a standard PC for the last few days now — you can run Firefox 2.8 and it comes without having to reboot your computer — and, of course, Tweeting.
To do so, I have to download the file, save it to the local machine, and launch Word and Twitter. Once Word and Twitter are installed, you can type in a link, like this:

If you’re feeling lazy, you can download Word and Twitter, just in case the cloud-storage companies aren’t your thing. As long as you have your Word, Twitter, Twitter, Dropbox, Facebook, Instagram, etc., you can browse the web on a Mac.

QR Codes
QR codes are codes to find the right person, place and time to meet. They can be used on a variety of occasions from career planning to romantic dinner.
QR codes are designed for companies that want to protect employees by removing unnecessary risks when their time and work is on line — or they have been for several years, with clients including Netflix and Pepsi.
Some of the companies using QR code strategies included Coca-Cola, Samsung, and Visa. In October 2012 Microsoft started using QR code strategies to protect the company’s business, starting with Microsoft’s use of QR code media. When Microsoft used QR code media to protect its PC business, it quickly saw an immediate increase in word of mouth.
However, companies are increasingly recognizing QR code technology could also make the business of the mobile experience more frictionless. There is a number of frictionless use cases for mobile devices:
To protect employees using QR code media, Microsoft recently added security features:
But QR code media can help people save costs.
Consider this practice called QR code insurance: Each time a person checks a QR code, the system will generate a separate ticket, automatically directing the user to the correct place to avoid possible work stoppage. This saves a lot of time. It also means that you don’t have to type in a code to get the tickets, and it also reduces the chances of accidentally checking your phone for a ticket.
So, the first time a person checks a QR code for their safety ticket, a new ticket is generated. When the user tries to scan the ticket to check their phone, the ticket generates an alert in their phone. The system sends the notification to the person via SMS or email.
If the user doesn’t respond to the notification to check their phone, the system will generate an alert to check their email. (There is also a risk of people using other apps, which could slow down the QR code media usage.)
QrCode media also has some downsides. The system can generate QR code media based on your previous activities. If it’s the last time you scan your phone, the system will generate QR codes based on the last time you scanned your phone. This means you may end up going to the convenience store right after you scanned your phone. For example, if you scan your camera with your QR code, the system will create QR codes that may be subject to geo-targeting, limiting the accuracy of your QR code.
Still, most of the time, scanning your phone is enough to get a basic image, and then you don’t need to scan your phone again.
If you don’t have QR code media, there is still more QR code advertising to do, although the amount is tiny. That is, most ads cost nothing to scan on smartphones or feature phones. But there is the chance that you will scan your phone, and there they are worth exploring, before scrolling over and buying.
It is not a huge number of QR code media outlets. In May, there were two reports of QR code media being used like advertising for the iPhone. In October, it was a new type of QR code that automatically generated QR code ads.
The QR code media, which includes advertising in the image above, will run on every device and use the same QR code technology from each phone, until there is a million devices with QR code media. The ads will be optimized for phones to display large screens, with big images, and therefore will be more relevant.
After many months of testing, one can imagine QR code media being useful for many more uses than what QR code media are good for. For example, if you use Starbucks, Starbucks mobile apps, or other apps like Pandora and YouTube, there are likely millions of QR code and QR code ads to be created.
QrCode media is a lot like QR codes, or QR loyalty program cards, or QR code campaigns. They were useful for finding goods to purchase from local grocery stores or from online retailer websites."
"Editor’s Note: This guest post was originally published in April, 2015 and Mike Butcher is the CEO of MobileSyrup. (The first two letters of his syntax were added after the quotation marks.) The second letter of his word is his favorite, e.g. “This time, I want to be a bit further ahead”.
In an attempt to bring attention to his recent blog post on entrepreneurship and crypto-economics, and shed some light on where he stands on broader issues, I have to admit I felt a little queasies on the head while watching him write the piece. I wondered if he had a vision on how technology, and specifically technology around the Bitcoin ecosystem, could fit into his vision.
To put it in simpler terms, it is more about a vision: The early entrepreneur on an idea like Bitcoin

 not that I think the future of computing will be ‘close’ and instead more so oriented towards “the big guys” — in other words, big-picture thinking enterprises that have traditionally been at odds with the traditional ways enterprises operate.
“If you look at the other space, it’s like when you went through a private beta, not the public beta; it’s not a new model. We don’t have that as a mainstay and instead try to make sense of existing practices, with their management philosophies,” he said. “I think the real question is ‘Where is the ‘new model’? Where is the new paradigm?”
The enterprise is a complex but perhaps necessary mix of technology and operations today. It is an entire ecosystem that doesn’t seem to be having a single, central repository. It is a mix of several that is constantly being reinvented and revised, by large organizations now starting to think more broadly about how and what they’ll look like two hundred years from now — and they’re all looking to fundamentally change the software they use.
When it comes to the public cloud: “The public cloud is a ‘tectonic’ shift,” said Smith, but he also cautioned against overly hasty predictions of what will happen in time. I’ve been in the software world and I’ve seen this pattern of iterating over and over and over. There are people that look at the current market and say software is a ‘bust’ and software is a ‘closing’. I see no evidence of that.
“I don’t think that software is a two-trillion-dollar market anymore,” said Smith. “But I know some companies, like Uber and Amazon, that are doing better, and it’s the end-game at most every company. For the next three to four quarters of the decade we just have to keep it going. I don’t know where your company is — if you’re growing, in the next five years, you will need to double your revenue.”
He didn’t share any details about Google’s cloud strategy. He’d only tell us that cloud is not a ‘key’ investment for the company yet.
Smith has a background in the enterprise software world (he also worked for Hewlett Packard) and the cloud is at the heart of what he’s doing. “The cloud is not a question of money – it’s a question of energy,” said Smith.
Given Cloudyn’s $20 million from Index Ventures, the company plans to spend a few seconds getting its feet wet before tackling a public release with something resembling a “Barry Evans with a chip on the face of a man”.
And let us also keep in mind that, while Smith is a long-term thinker with an impressive background, this has been his first public appearance, so this might have been the cloud phase of his career. Smith is still very guarded on the details of his next project. Perhaps the hope is that Cloudyn will tap his engineering-talent and enterprise ties, and then move on to the next phase of building a larger social network around software."
"Apple is getting into enterprise mobility again. It announced at WWDC that it would open up a 100-employee workplace within AirWatch, a security application that monitors a company’s network while also informing workers about their performance and ability to work independently, which is probably not something they envisioned when they set the company up two years ago.
Apple’s enterprise mobility has really been going since they launched their consumer handset and Mac in 2011. The company has expanded mobile presence throughout the business landscape with Apple Pay, a mobile payments system the company developed specifically for enterprise customers that works with banks, insurance providers, the government and more to power mobile transactions in their office/house.
As is usually the case, Apple was tight-lipped about a new feature when their announcement came around. However, it later announced a redesigned iPhone 6 and an iPad Pro with a fingerprint sensor to expand its mobile security and identity protection measures.
The enterprise program is going live right now on the company website but is being confirmed via press. Apple will be announcing it later this week at its annual Worldwide Partner’s Conference.
While the company has made plenty of waves so far with the launch of its new iPhone 6, it has done little as to whether it was going to bring Apple Pay to enterprise customers. According to reports from The WSJ and WSJ Europe, and 9to5mac, Apple Pay is not at all coming to the enterprise.
That could come in relief that Apple could be testing for it more directly.

 we would be in that,” he says.
Tidbit plans to use today’s funding “to continue to grow our network of content-based influencers on the platform and grow our community at large”, as the company said in a statement.
The news comes at the same time as another development that Tidbit has announced today, that it is getting “a number of publishers to commit to presenting content to our community today”. That platform is to let third parties take over the editorial role and develop their own content, with the aim of giving the company further exposure, for now, through an open development program."
"A number of media sites on Sunday published the most recent stats about Facebook’s daily active users – and it was a lot more confusing than simple news updates.
Facebook’s DAU as of early 2012 was just over 1.39 billion. That’s essentially the same number as Twitter’s but higher.
A company spokesperson, in a press release issued to TechCrunch, denied being on a bubble, saying “There are a number of metrics that show a consistent usage profile across our website and across Facebook. If you want to learn more about those, you’ve been able to explore our site, apps and apps.”
But all are different when it comes to usage.
On Facebook, and especially Twitter, people check the service a lot. Over 1 billion people check the service on Facebook today. On Twitter it’s a bit more modest at 600 million.
Facebook’s data showed it was going to see a couple of million active users per month. On Twitter, which has also been hit hard by the big push by Twitter users, it’s going to see an average of 1.13 billion active users per month.
Facebook’s data showed that usage was in decline for months after the company added 5 million monthly users. It showed little sign of growth to the past three months before now, so they might have been out of their peak and out of the swing.

The company’s user base is still growing, even while Facebook is going through a big shift in its strategy to more advertiser-based products and a new identity that it hopes will help users control what they see on Facebook. That’s really important for a company like Facebook. For years the company started out trying to convince users that their data would be free and then they would turn it into gold. It turned out people loved ad-free services, it came along those ad-free connections on Facebook’s road.
The company’s user base was in middle of doubling when Facebook caped up and began monetizing the data with real-time ad-buying in November 2012.
Facebook’s user numbers are now in double digits, while Twitter’s are starting to dip. They have now hit 4 million.

Facebook’s user count and its current growth makes it look like Twitter’s user base is in the same ballpark as Facebook’s, but that has not been the case for the past three years. Facebook’s user count has grown from about 390 million to 795 million users. Twitter’s user count has decreased from 200 million to 50 million.
“Over the last three months, we’ve seen growth from users across devices and geographies, increasing to reach 1.36 billion daily user activity. The average number of connections users are making and the volume of news stories published on any device are very much the same. Facebook’s user activity has been dramatically improved.”
But these stats aren’t from Facebook’s users alone. The company has been running a massive test to see how users could use Graph Search to find friends on Twitter. These stats were published by Facebook on Sunday, after it had publicly posted the numbers takes place this weekend. It showed strong engagement, with strong positive results. The company will have to see if they have the best, most engaging ways to improve the product on Twitter. The bigger question is whether Facebook is still interested in trying to grow, or if it needs to expand aggressively, as Instagram has demonstrated.
Facebook was not on Twitter’s DAU today as of 2/2/11.
But while it’s been clear for the past three, and half, of an email’s worth of followers, Facebook has been focusing on media sites, and getting them to publish on it is a smart move."

 going to the end of the night, and I was able to put them up for a week without any issues. A month later, their siblings stopped responding and began turning the other way around.
On the other side of the equation, the siblings could have some big issues that aren’t as simple as a broken heart, like a newborn bald baby. Those conditions are not uncommon and may be preventable, but many of these in-born children miss the early signs of their illness.
A recently published article in the New York Times details their struggles with understanding and navigating the complex medical history and international medicine history of the world, which includes a lot of new information.
Those stories are also troupe to read from parents, saying that their own parents have suffered the same pain from heart and cocaine.
“That was not fun to learn,” says Martina.
Although she doesn’t have kids herself, the Martins have been connected with other family members and doctors who helped them find diagnoses for their sons. “When you’re expecting a babble, you want to learn things you weren’t taught,” she says of this process.
“We wanted to do something to help them navigate through this, and hopefully make it easier for other mums, as well. When I was in labour, I got really emotional. I wish I can do something that will help other people, too. My job is helping people, but we want it to work.”"
"For those who were looking to see what the company’s next moves would be, the company is already making its first big move about moving outside of its native Germany. Today the company confirmed that it is moving its European HQ to London and buying out its local HQ in Berlin to expand the team with new hires.
The move, in which German startup SumUp first announced its plans, is part of the bigger re-org of the SumUp organization, which has been re-building and re-building itself in recent months and plans more to change how the company figures out where to next build out, and when, when and where to expand its business.
“At some point, we will want to sell our local business in Germany,” the company said in an email to TechCrunch. “This will enable us to have more sales, marketing and engineering teams in Germany, as well as better support our growth in the U.S. The benefits of that are still unclear.”
One aspect that will remain is the SumUp’s operations in Germany. Now it looks like that focus will be even more on a number of markets, specifically in Europe.
“We already have some contracts with our customers in Germany. Now we are opening up the contract with our customers in the U.S. and also in the BRIC regions.” said Martin Lorendl, CEO and chairman of the company in a statement.
“The German market is a key opportunity for us. We were already in it when we started the German business, more than 10 years ago. We had to fight hard to get this contract now, and to try to do the right amount of value in the market that was right for us,” he added.
The rest of the European press also got the news today, including the London Evening Standard, which took note of what it describes as “a couple of extra surprises.”
A few details are actually in the background here and should come out tomorrow (he didn’t say how long that will take, but he says it will be in the next couple of weeks and may take a couple of months to do the re-build): The company will raise its next financing round, probably as early as the summer of 2015, with more details along this credit books. This will mean raising $400 million later this year to cover more growth, and also more cash to help make acquisitions. And there are a couple of big exits that could follow, too.
“We are building an international company,” he said in a statement today. “That is why the company needs to raise more money right now. We want to acquire bigger companies, as quickly as possible, to make the company even bigger. I couldn’t do it faster than we’ve been able to in the past. We have a huge advantage, and you have to wait for the new investors to give you the opportunity to grow even further.”
He’s talking about the company having “one million customers in 20 countries” ahead of it announcing partnerships with carriers in each of those markets on some

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 our mobile devices, which is really the new piece of the puzzle we need to solve if we want to move faster to the next level.”
On the revenue side, while it’s still waiting for Google’s approval, Apple sees iOS as a “growth engine” and has continued holding itself out for a better share of the global tablet market. The iPad is the key in terms of device sales, but Apple has yet to find its footing, even as competition from new iPad entrants like Microsoft begins to erode iOS’s hold. The iPad has proved more of a niche than a central theme for iOS 7, and some analysts had pegged it as the new convergence piece from iOS forever.

At this point, Apple can’t risk looking foolish if it can’t use this new tech in a way that’s both new and different. In just its first six months as a device, the iPad has proven its worth. With a new $35-per-month software subscription service, Apple’s take on true mobile computing is clear. If it doesn’t want to be the next Google or Apple, it might be best known for being Apple’s top selling machine.
By taking shortcuts to its software, the iPad could encourage developers to build for it. They’ll want to avoid the walled garden of mobile operating systems created by Google and Apple at last expense, and more software is coming to the iPad today. Pushing developers to build for iPhone will also provide cross-platform developers (Android eventually) with the same flexibility that iOS enjoys.
The iPad is just the first step in Apple’s mobile strategy, however. Apple wants every Mac sold — Mac, iPad, iPod touch, iOS, iCloud, etc — to be a Mac. The company’s new Macs include the new iPad Air, as well as the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Both are designed to be a PC in every frame, in case you thought Apple was a touch-first company."
"Apple is preparing to unveil new iPhones at the September 9 event, according to a new report from German newspaper Der Spiegel. The new models are going to pack a host of differences when they are finally launched, with things like a new patent for improved ultrafast flash response time, along with a host of different camera and audio sensor fixes across the board, as well as the addition of optical 3D mapping and digital zoom features.
The addition of 3D to Apple mobile devices is already huge, but a slew of other improvements are on the way which should be a welcome thing for users who were hoping for Apple to ditch its traditional, 2D keyboard for one that adapts to fit the needs of a bigger screen. It also means that even if an iPhone is redesigned with a physical keyboard, the software keyboard used as the entry point will be going to disappear too, and thus a true iPhone user experience wouldn’t be possible.
But what’s most interesting is the possible changes that may lie in iOS device customizations that may come as part of this new update. If you were hoping for something completely different with iOS 8, you can’t quite make it out of the box, but there’s certainly a better way to approach it than that.
One of the more interesting new features rumored to be coming is a tweak to the way iOS handles FaceTime video calling. While Apple has previously said that you can only call up contacts using traditional FaceTime, the new option would allow for that feature to work more seamlessly in iOS 9. This might mean more opportunities for flexible communication, making the more of a natural extension to the iOS desktop stream.
FaceTime video chat would be perfect for iOS 9, and so long as you’re available on all iOS devices, from the iPhone all the way up to the latest iPad, it would be huge fun to finally be able to call anyone on iOS at this point, whether you’re a friend, colleague, landlord, co-worker or even a complete stranger.
Other additions to iOS are likely to be much less exciting, with a few tweaks we might already know for certain, like Passbook to iOS 9, but perhaps never implemented. An iPad mini with a much less powerful processor is one of the likely candidates; we’ll have to wait and see what they’re up to at WWDC next week.
In terms of what else is going on with iOS, there’s likely more coming out this month, so stay tuned to find out what iPhone, iPad and Apple will have to unveil — they’ll only be at Apple’s September 9 event."
"It’s hard to find a restaurant that truly excels at keeping busy during brunch and dinners this time of year. Luckily, that doesn’t mean restaurants can’t be busy. On the contrary, the people who do plan to eat there

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
� of the project. That’s probably because there are several teams and their own tools, but it does allow the company to get more bang for its buck.
While you can’t say what they will be able to do, it definitely makes it easier to stay on top of progress. It’s up to us, but these guys probably knew what they needed to deal with, and how much we needed to work out of their head. The only problem is finding them (or making sure they’re available) before the release, so it’ll be interesting to see what Microsoft chooses to do on this front. It’ll probably make the product more stable. As we move to Android and iOS we can see if Microsoft decides the same as before.
Microsoft hasn’t been a stranger to helping out. A bunch of teams are now using the free Preview program, which is quite handy in setting things up. Microsoft has already done quite a bit of work helping companies figure out how the design and development process works. It can’t have everything figured out and the company stays at that stage. Microsoft has spent a good amount of effort here already.
Microsoft can easily have a lot of products and its team of programmers are going to make sure it’s not over-hyped, but if the team isn’t working for it, Microsoft would love to have a backstop on its development. If the design, development and sales are still in its control, Microsoft is more than just offering a free service.
Even though I feel like Microsoft can be more transparent about this, in hindsight, it should have made several seasons to keep this information from the company’s customers from signing it. Perhaps it had the intention of helping out the company more directly, but they also wanted to offer their best feature, and the team felt they should have just get whatever the requited features were. That’s okay by me and you can’t fault anyone for wanting more transparency.
The company was tended for the release of the Android beta and iOS beta as an invitation in many ways. A few of the features being offered to them are new features and updates that are expected in the first quarter of 2015. Microsoft wasn’t willing to give any hints about what might come next.
Microsoft’s Windows team was asked to help out as part of this release, we’re told, while the company is also preparing to announce a new licensing agreement with the entire Windows team, including the upcoming release of Office 365 next spring. Windows 10 will also be supported in Microsoft’s next betas, and then you’re asking customers what to expect next.
The last thing that I would want is for Microsoft to have to pay to have the beta program, especially if its mobile business is not performing so well.
It’s time for the company to move to its mobile offerings because the world is going mobile with more and more attention being given to iOS and Android. Even though we’re still a few years away from being able to pay a business fee on a software package that isn’t even in a stable state, customers should never have to worry more, you need to make sure you are being taken care of by your developer partners."
"Facebook is trying out a new way to boost engagement on the site, with users having to share longer and more frequently engaging with Pages, for example. But if the average Facebook user just uses Facebook (and has never even been to the site before), engagement will drop.
As a part of Facebook’s “Interest Graph Optimization” efforts, Page owners have a new option on what type of content they want their fans to discuss on the social network: share more pictures and videos.
There’s some history to the new feature. Last April, CEO Mark D’Hanley noted that users will start seeing those buttons more frequently if users are getting increasingly close to their friends. Now that the feature is in place, only those who are close to their friend will see “Featured Pages.”
We were also told that the Featured Pages are the default product that visitors see when they visit the platform.
Facebook tells me that there may be some users whose News Feeds will be seeing these buttons for the first time today, and I’m personally getting my fingers crossed about seeing them popping up in my search results.
That all happens in a hidden part of the search results page, though. Until now, when you click on a Page, you’d see a list of recent pictures and videos from Facebook Pages you’ve shared that were featured by friends.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 site, it is worth a search engine or Google. And it’s probably going to be one of the biggest reasons that makes the difference between Android and iOS 6. I’d say Android is better, but a lot of other people’s software is better and Android devices often have better screen.
The biggest change to the operating system is that Google Now no longer displays things you might miss, like just a few days after you signed it up. Instead, Google Now learns and improves your experience with the information you provide by your searches, your friends and by your life.
With Google Now it is a question of who’s a better answer. While Google Answers just about covers things up to the last day, there is also a lot of noise. Sometimes I want to get a bit of info in a while and then need time to make a decision that’ll hurt myself. While I’m happy there is going to be a day where Google makes the right call, a moment is fleeting and the best questions are always out there.
Apple’s iOS is also in its second year of general availability, which isn’t bad either, but it’s disappointing to miss out on what Android’s feature set is like.
While people have been talking about the Nexus Q and the Nexus S, I’m already thinking of what I like more as better, but more limited, Android devices. The Nexus Q and LG G5 are already available, but not when you’re looking for something quick enough to play Angry Birds or something super complex to play Farmville.
It’s frustrating because I’ve spent so much of my iPhone or iPad on Android and I’ve miss out on what could have been otherwise. My Nexus S is my absolute favorite, but it’s still just really bad when you’re wondering how you can play Angry Birds and you miss out on a lot of features.
Samsung has great software on Android, but I have to learn it first. With my Nexus, I can simply install a games or apps to the phone and instantly get going.
When it comes up to Android, I’m in love with the Lollipop update. With Lollipop everything has been redesigned, simplified and enhanced. While Google was good about its approach to the fragmentation issue and its compatibility with more than anything, the Lollipop update will also be more limited in my opinion. 
As of today when it comes to Android skinning, I usually spend the most time in my life playing with Google’s skin on my Nexus, trying to play just as well as Angry Birds on Android without having to install any skins. This was basically the only time I ever really spent on Android, which is a shame. I could easily see myself giving it a try for the Nexus S.

The Nexus S skin is smooth and easy to use. As of now, the stock Android experience is a pleasant surprise even though the experience doesn’t feel that great when you’re not using it quite as much as you do, which is good news.
The Nexus S skin is pretty attractive, as always with Android, but I can see myself being stuck on Android, which is really annoying when it comes to scrolling and launching apps. In other words, Android is just not something you want to use during your phone’s most important moments. 
As with any update, it’s going to be tough for people using Lollipop to find the new features that make it easier to use your phone. If you install any kind of framework — Google’s or ours — from a completely different perspective than your Nexus, chances are people will want a lot more customization options. I’ve had my Nexus a few weeks or so, and I’ve been enjoying the new skin quite a bit, but it didn’t really feel like the best experience going my way. 
What if all of that goes out the window? What if you just start the Nexus S now? Will it make up for the stock experience like the Nexus Q? Maybe. Just don’t make everyone switch to Android? 

I don’t think Nexus has ever done enough to win at this game, but if it does manage to win, I can’t help but think about how well it could really benefit from a software update. We’ll know more in a few months. 
But for all we know…I might be spending a lot of my free time in the Nexus S skin. 
But this is the Nexus at the end of the day. Nexus can be a great product. That, and it is a Nexus from the start.
So while we have the Nexus S, what about the Nexus 4? It’s a big bet on a manufacturer coming up on the Nexus campaign, and that’s likely why Google is putting

by, and then “it’s very much the case that we didn’t have a good enough product to cover our competitors,” as co-founder and CEO Omid Zechory put it, with many of its competitors relying on search, email and social media, for its social, sharing features.
“We were seeing people asking us to build better ones,” Zechory explained about why his company decided to productize its social media capabilities into a product. “Google Analytics’s social analytics feature, the product that has built the reputation of being the best social market research firm in the world, had so much influence and value that we found ourselves asking how can we better leverage that? And that’s where we came up with the idea to build Socialcam.”
Zechory declined to discuss further terms of the potential acquisition, so it’s not as though the company hasn’t been aggressively advertising the opportunity for acqui-hires at this point. The Socialcam app is being shut down according to the App Store description.
The social video chatting application, which first debuted during SXSW in February as an in-app activity video app, and later rolled out on the web thanks to mobile redesign, let you create private video chats with other users, viewable via their Facebook profiles, and share with a variety of networks, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, on average across the app’s supported networks.
However, the Faceshift technology Socialcam acquired back in March after AppWorld sold to Adobe, was not integrated with the startup.
At the time, Socialcam CEO Tim Chae wrote:
Chae explains why the acquisition made sense as the company decided it needed to build on its growing traction and user base. When App World sold down to a handful of employees, Chae said the entire Socialcam team were refocused on building an impressive product that people would eventually get behind and be able to use once the all-new product came around, which in turn came later. Today, that product is that, as mentioned, Socialcam is now embedding.
The acquisition of Socialcam means Socialcam, as we know it today, has the potential to continue its rapid growth. App World later had 5,700-plus mobile applications under its banner, for example, and Socialcam users were spending a cumulative 1.5 hours per session using the platform per month, he noted.
Chae, while he would not say the number of monthly active users on Facebook, did say how many had joined in the past month or so. He also confirmed that Socialcam was the #9 social app in many respects on Facebook a year ago, and the app had climbed to a high of #6 in social apps. (Socialcam’s is not a direct comparison, however – it’s based on a user’s engagement rating and friends/following behaviors, which can vary.)

Chae says App World pulled Socialcam’s social app out of the store but was re-installing it today, so it’s probably still live.
The app, however, is no longer live. Users are being contacted via email, which they can choose to reply to within the app’s help app in order to turn it over to their new device. However, they can do so without giving Socialcam a personal inbox.

App World, for the record , says it was not able to determine if or how many users were affected by the acqui-hire – and it doesn’t have its own social/reblog API. App World has not disclosed its own user count, so these numbers are more of an effort to cover usage than a real-up front-count of numbers. App World could not verify numbers it claimed, we’re told.
In a statement, a Socialcam spokesperson describes the acquisition as in “no way affecting the App Store release process.”
We’ve reached out to Twitter for comment and will update if they respond."
"Apple has a brand new iPhone to show off today, and that means the iTunes App Store is littered with new mobile applications designed for the iPhone 6 Plus Plus. The theme here is a common one: new apps for Power, iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, for example, as well as Apple Pay, a mobile card acceptance application that allows both customers and merchants to process Apple Pay transactions instantly as a matter of push and pull. New apps for the iPad include the same, too.
The iTunes Store is also awash with Apple Pay integrations. Now there’s Apple Pay in the form of “Apple Pay” buttons at the top of the

 to the suspected sales and “revenue (of £1,000) in 2014”, although more than 10% of all of its transaction revenue is “back to finanancers” or investors.
“It was a good company and they decided to invest in us because their socially and culturally fit on a company, because they’re not going to be doing very well,” she explains. “We were going through a process of going through investors because we wanted to raise series B but I also saw other projects that we had been doing,” she adds.
As for where they plan to start building next and who the investors are, they are considering a couple of companies, including a “really big consumer play around health with a startup in London” they haven’t announced. A third part of their target list is some sort of app that lets them track a patient’s health issues, including monitoring general well-being metrics.
“A big part of the round will go on to the next round — it’s about raising more capital very quickly before the startup cycle has started,” she tells me. “The very long term vision is to grow up. Right now we are at a late stage, so we want to grow up a lot faster. That money is very good for us.”
For how many deals they are talking to, she was less clear.
“We have five deals [from the Series A stage to the first Series B] and I think that shows that we are growing very quickly. It’s been a great opportunity for us. We’re able to attract very wealthy investors and we will continue to see more deals like the one we did with [Apex] in the second funding round because people in London and elsewhere have been very happy to back it.
“The most important thing is, the quality is high. It is a very high quality team and I’m feeling really good about them. And what’s very good about our strategy is that they’re not only taking a few investors but they’re very, very focused on it.”
“In two months of doing this, the first round, we’re now already in the second round because there’s so much interest,” she adds. “I think the first round was more for sales and we’re very clearly working on that and really scaling that up.”"
"Reedsy is a site for fashion lovers to sell items to each other. There’s a thriving community for people who love fashion, especially when it comes to finding unique items, finding unique style trends and making a great sale. For example, TechCrunch recently covered a great sale on Reedsy’s site.
Since late November, Reedsy has seen over 10,000 buyers posting over 13,000 sales. That sounds pretty good for a new site, but the company still has a few kinks to work out.
Today, Reedsy is officially launching a few new features for buyers, including “Buy It For Me” buttons, which let you pay with a credit card or bank account, as well as new social sharing options that let you keep track of what people you’re communicating with are buying.
But I’m interested in the company’s future plans for fashion consumers. In particular, founder & CEO Omidyar Savitt, is interested in the “fashion-as-a-vivacy” market.
During our conversation, Savitt expressed interest in expanding beyond the fashion community. He was previously a successful fashion entrepreneur, founding his own apparel store Fashism in NYC. In 2012, he raised $30 million from NEA and other top-tier investors. And he has his own brand collections for that community. He also wants to help artists and designers find new ways to communicate what they are creating to people with the world around them.
He told me that he thinks the time is right to start creating a new type of social network for fashion lovers. When I asked what it means in Reedsy’s early days, his response was a mixture of a few main points to describe both what is meant for the consumer and how it functions. Savitt said that the site was always meant to be open to the entire community, to find all the interesting things, to communicate with each other and to show them the goods, so there was never a default “buy for me” on the site.
He also said that the site would always be free, and that users would pay a $2 registration fee.
“We want to buy things that spark interest so that there will

The other big new feature is the ability to offer push notification when you’re following an account you already subscribed to.
But the big new feature is the ability to offer a limited group of account holders a one-time discount of $1,800 for a single user when you have 30,000 subscribed users. However, you still need to have 30,000 subscribers for the price to be truly enticing for a business customer. Users can also subscribe, or cancel at any time.
In addition, for existing users, the change will enable a new “Subscribe” button to make it easier to cancel or quickly remove the subscription from their account so that they can try out the new service.

"Tapping into social media platforms has always been a challenge, whether you’re trying to gauge the performance of a business or finding an investment of a certain size and profile — usually a $1 million plus, $3.5 million plus (up to $16 million or more). Today, in an era when companies like Facebook have become so mainstream, Twitter has been so good at its hand. In short, companies, individuals and investors have started to look beyond social media platforms to get the full picture. If you know anything about the ecosystem around you, it’s just come along way too long ago.
Today, it turns out that most companies have been looking for the right time — in a recent TechCrunch article, we suggested that it was time for an economic revival, and I’m not the only proponent of this point of view. Now, Twitter and Facebook both have their own moments of economic growth, and they look to be more successful — and maybe even profitable — than their legacy predecessors.
Here are just a few of the major trends that may be behind the decline in Twitter over the last year:
We all know that there’es been something of a drought for social media companies over the last year. But it’s not going to be an overwhelming black winter out here. The current wave of Twitter-sans-Tech companies is one of the strongest ever — in fact, we seem to have finally reached when the hype cycle hits and the companies can show real results in the market. A lot remains for the company, and it’s not going to be easy.
Here’s the rub that Twitter has to deal with:

The current crisis doesn’t mean that the current economic realities are going to go away. There will always be a segment who believe that social media platforms like Twitter would thrive long into the mainstream, and that, should not be the case. However, to be fair, there’s still a lot to be done for social media startups, and Twitter just released an updated SVP of Product. In short, Twitter is now a company that is more focused on its brand and the public sphere, than on the product, and that’s something that could change over time.
There will be a time soon when Twitter will be on the cusp of an inflection point as this new, more robust and larger market appears to emerge. In which case, if Twitter can continue to grow, its users will keep coming back, and if one of them can’t get to 30 million users, they won’t slow down. And so far, it’s been working.
A couple of key trends will make Twitter less of a buyer’s market for investors: #1 (or more) user growth, higher recurring revenue (a.k.a. subscriptions), high quality customer service, a broader platform of services that integrate with the rest of the platform (like Ads.me), increased monetization opportunities and a shift toward a subscription economy. We should point out the following only, not the one I expected.
While it’s been common to hear about some of these trends over the last year — and given the research on where Twitter is headed — the last was less a product development and more of a slow pivot to a subscription model.
If you haven’t already noticed, the company launched a subscription model for advertising and for “promoted placement” of its stream (a traditional banner ad). This was not a surprise. Twitter has been seeing increasing user growth over time and, according to some (noted by me), there is clearly a “significant amount of demand out there for a way to provide an ongoing revenue stream for our platform during a time when there are higher potential for multiple cost structures with more recurring revenue in place.”

One of the more important things to note here is the fact that the company is still growing. This is a platform, not a revenue stream, so the company doesn’t need to make money anytime soon. Instead, it needs to grow a huge and healthy subscriber base (and growing without making money would

 to make sure it can’t miss its customers. That’s why its recently announced “acqui-hire” (yes, technically, a tech acquisition) of Braintree founder Brian Roll is so significant to the company.
Of course, the acquisition isn’t just happening because of this product. Square, which is also valued at $1 billion after its previous raise) has made a spate of acquisitions to improve its customer base, but it doesn’t have a huge acquisition budget like its new partner on this deal.
Square declined to comment on the current valuation of the deal.
Baron also talked out what he sees as Square’s future beyond simply making a big payment on a small business model, but that it may be able to make something much bigger in the future: creating a “personal ecosystem” around your financial identity."
"When it came to user privacy, it was a little bit more clear cut than most people — at least according to an independent report published today by the Pew Internet Panel.
The Pew report is based on a survey of over 1,800 online consumers, and more than a third of respondents said they’d be interested in the data, and almost 60 percent said that they’d heard about the Pew report via social media sites.
The report seems to indicate there may not be an audience for such controversial positions on privacy, which is probably true, and people may have a hard time voicing their own opinion without worrying they’re going to get spammed by businesses — but those opinions may be skewed toward a more positive view of privacy than many would likely expect.
For example, if you’re just looking for a quick and easy way to comment on a status update that might offend your friend, and the survey shows you overwhelmingly favor a positive view of privacy, you know that that your judgment is likely skewed to support the social and political narratives that dominate view of the tech industry.
The Pew study also shows that most respondents are very familiar with sharing personal information — over 90 percent are familiar with the information they gathered thanks to a social or internet connection. The report says that most people aren’t aware that there is such widespread sharing of personal information.

As is often the case when people use the internet, they aren’t aware of some of the norms, rules, and norms of other services to create their web profiles. Those social networks require users to submit their Facebook and Twitter personal information, which may or may not be publicly shared with others (though if you do have a public profile, you should be using it).
In the case, according to Pew, almost half of respondents know that their information was shared with people from the web at some point in time while they were on the web.
The findings show that a majority (62 percent) of respondents have friends and family, while 39 percent share with their college buddies, 18 percent with their colleagues, 12 percent with colleagues and a few with the public.
The study found a clear “gap” in the middle of the country, especially across social platforms where people are online and where their most recent information was made public.
The report also found that people are far more likely to be aware (86 percent) of information from social networks, while only 10 percent “know that their most personal network information is posted over social networks.” (Another 5 percent had no idea.)

As my colleague Josh Williams has argued in the past, this makes the data on the Internet less reliable (and more subjective) rather than more consistent: “This research shows nothing about how many people are aware of the contents of social networks, and if you don’t have a personal reason to think about it, the results are meaningless.”
It’s worth pointing out, as the Pew report did, that the data skew somewhat heavily towards respondents who are likely to make a political statement in response to the current political climate: “The data suggests that most surveys, excluding the one on the right, are targeted toward those likely to make a political statement in the future.” In other words, the survey results skews strongly towards those giving a political speech rather than just using a political statement as the basis for further political advocacy.
The report also found strong political alignment on the above political statement: “The survey respondents were 2.1 times more likely to express a view that they were or will make a political statement by the next day, with 63 percent expressing support for political action. Although this result is unlikely on the higher end of the spectrum, given the nature of an open-ended political action, it raises questions about whether political action is truly necessary in the current political climate.”

s are going to be a huge part of the game when it comes to what we build. There’s a lot of things we have in mind… We’re going to be focused on building a brand of these devices — not just for other games but very specifically for games that take place in the living room — and building all those games in a very large space that’s easy to reach, because no matter how small it is.
There’s going to be a lot of innovation there.”
In other words, if you’re talking about bringing home the Ouya, don’t be too far off."
"Microsoft has confirmed what many had suspected. The Xbox One console will likely be available for pre-order at a price under $60. Microsoft also confirmed the Xbox One, Xbox 360, Xbox 360 and Xbox 360 Eye owners do not need the Kinect to play new titles on the Xbox One – the Kinect is an optional feature, as Microsoft wanted to avoid competing directly with Apple’s Mac/PC offerings.
The $60 price has a few caveats though: games played with the Xbox One will work, as does the $100 and $50 ‘Casts’ you would get if bought from the Xbox Store. Also, all games will be available for immediate purchase.
The announcement for the console comes just hours after Microsoft announced the Xbox 360, PlayStation 4 and Apple TV. Microsoft announced all three today."
"Microsoft has revealed its new HoloLens virtual reality headset today at a demo, but as expected in a developer preview launch a headset that has integrated Oculus hardware, and will offer a separate Oculus-powered headset. The headset will support Oculus by the end of its summer, however, according to Microsoft.
There are some ways to play it out with Oculus, but they don’t allow Oculus to deliver a consumer version for now, which could mean it will support the Oculus Rift headset too on the very same day.
This isn’t the first time Microsoft has said it will partner with Oculus, however – it did just a HoloLens preview in August last year. This new HoloLens prototype will also be shown off during the Build developer conference later today.
The Microsoft demo also offered up a quick demo of the HoloLens, which allowed the audience to see around 360-degree movement (which isn’t possible with a headset designed to do motion-tracking through a headset), look around in real-time and interact with and play games without requiring the headset to connect to a PC.

Now the headset is officially on the market, and Microsoft is showing off some of the first applications and experiences around the platform, including a game based on Minecraft called Minecraft Snap. It turns out that it isn’t quite ready for real-life in virtual reality – which could be a big problem for Microsoft.
“We know it’s not comfortable that we’ve worked out all the technical challenges to get this working. We’ll be doing an update later this year to get this better,” explained Surface head of hardware Stephen Elop onstage today at The Consumer Electronics Show. “But it’s definitely fun, and it provides something we haven’t planned on — we haven’t planned on using Oculus,” he said.
Elop talked about the challenges of building these developer experiences.
Microsoft’s head of platform Peter Edstrom stressed that developers will be in charge of getting their hands on the new developer platform, and that the company will take a sophistic inclusiveness approach when it comes to the software development kit.
“If we have something we want to build that’s not going to work or it doesn’t work on our HoloLens developer solution we have to work our way through. We don’t expect developers to have all the endpoints or the endpoints all the way through,” he said. “We expect to provide a place where a developer can just plug in their Halo device.”
Named HoloLens, Microsoft is shipping the HoloLens in a wide beta. The first devices will be sold a bit later today through Microsoft’s retail store. They will be on sale in select stores all around the U.S. by November of next year.
Elop said they were not prepared to announce exact device numbers for those devices, and would announce the exact number of Windows devices that Microsoft will sell during “the holiday months.” He didn’t talk about price, but Microsoft is very comfortable this is priced at the point where it’s a decent deal and should help it make more headphones faster and better for the consumer.

 progress of the day. There was a lot of talk about the new CEO of the board seat, who previously worked at Google before joining VMware in early 2007, where he was VP and shared responsibility with the co-founder of the VMware Foundation —  Jim Weir, who became CEO in 2009. The board seat for Weir was a big validation, Weir told me at the time.
The news and company’s reputation are both going to remain intact, Weir says. The company’s shareholders are re-envoring the deal, he says today.
The move is consistent with VMware’s long-term plan to offer greater enterprise solutions, while continuing product development for its vSAN platform that offers a broader portfolio of security tools including patent-pending security appliances and monitoring tools.

In particular, the company will emphasize its product suite for the enterprise, as this is very much a company that embraces the need for security solutions for enterprise workloads — whether virtualized or public data centers, for example — that require the ability to manage IP access, network access, security and more."
"A startup called Kino is making it easier for app developers to collect and share user data, with an open source, open-source platform called KinoCloud as a service. The company today announced $7.25 million in Series A funding, led by Sequoia Capital, with participation from other existing investors.
That funding comes at a time when the company is becoming something that is not only a platform, but one which is capable of storing and sharing data, including users’ payment card and data associated with the apps they download.
According to Kino founder and CEO Amitabh Sinhal, the company’s biggest competition to date is Microsoft for Windows Phone. With Windows Phone still the second-most widely used platform in the U.S., he says the competition is there, and the platform is growing, but Windows Phone lacks the breadth of apps that its competitors offer.
“Windows Phone apps — for most people — will never be more than 1 percent of downloads,” Sinhal says. “So the key thing for the market is that it has a strong monetization strategy. But the Windows Phone market isn’t the Windows market, yet…it has more than 1 million developers [and] it has very strong retention right now. So the challenge is a matter of delivering a platform that can help to monetize.”
For the end user, KinoCloud lets them share data with friends, and even create charts and graphs of that content. For example, a developer could create a chart for a news app, and show how users are reacting to that story on mobile — all on the back-end KinoCloud platform. Other data then becomes available, such as the user’s browser history when downloading an app, their app usage, what apps they bought in the past while using the app, and a more recent traffic spike compared with other app downloads.
The startup is available on any device and is compatible with almost any iOS, Android, BlackBerry and Nokia phones (Nokia has the Lumia line). A Windows Phone app is available and will be made available to the marketplace in the near future.
KinoCloud provides an end-to-end management platform for apps, with an engine that tracks app usage and the behavior across various apps so that apps can be kept in the cloud indefinitely, on-premise. The KinoCloud engine is designed to be platform-agnostic, so any mobile version can be used without a doubt.
For its developer audience, KinoCloud is the perfect platform to have because it offers a complete ecosystem and the ability to build apps quickly and keep them running for years. For a mobile app developer who may choose to use CocayneCloud as his platform, KinoCloud is the ideal platform. The platform has been developed to allow the use of more than just the back-end of the app, which can be updated as apps are developed. (As a developer, I think it would be interesting to see how your app can be updated and repromoted without breaking your app store budget.) Developers can start the KinoCloud App Store and make apps available to KinoCloud’s marketplace so early access to KinoCloud’s platform will be possible.
The company today faces a large number of challengers in making its marketplace a more usable experience by the end user. Many of these are coming from the development community, such as Cyanogen. To compete, developers are going to have to not only find more efficient ways of making paid apps, but also make improvements to the user experience — to remove friction that comes with doing so.
In today’s world, the most common use for a free app is downloading a paid app. KinoCloud wants to make these experiences much more convenient, creating not just free apps but more engaging

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
, to help users manage and manage their social profiles, has expanded to provide a tool for Facebook and Pinterest alike that enables those in the process of ‘liking’, commenting, liking and sharing on these social media platforms to boost their performance. 
Instead of relying on the social web to help users manage this web presence, this new Facebook/Pinterest/Tumblr/Twitter ‘Liking’ and ‘KISS’-like feature aims to help users boost their success on the social web. This new feature pulls data from a number of social web-based platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and the now recently launched Google+
In turn, it’s designed to aid users who use social media to gain their first exposure with a tool that optimizes their social interactions with their friends and followers to help them discover and connect with the people in their life. In doing so, they find a better way to connect than if they go “looking at someone else.” 
In the big picture, the problem with many social and mobile apps is that users don’t care whether or not those apps were launched before or after they have a chance to connect. Today’s social media interactions in and on the web have largely been honed by companies like Facebook and Twitter, and in many cases they’re well on their way to matching their respective usage. And as a result, engagement has not yet outpaced its time on mobile.
As Facebook’s recent launch of Graph Search into advertising shows, this new, faster-loading, ‘Liking’ and commenting features are just the beginning of a process that could see the site even more aggressively integrating third-party social services, as it has with Twitter, or with Instagram. The next step is to go beyond this, to build a stronger, more engaging platform that matches the engagement levels of its core services. And that could begin the search of any other social service.
This is precisely where the potential for companies like Instabridge and its founder and CEO, Kevin Linden, comes into play. For now, Instabridge sits in the social search space as one of a number of startups to add a faster and more reliable way to connect with friends, especially if you like video. However, unlike Instabridge, it’s mostly about video, as it’s an extension of the social web.
However, Instabridge is not afraid to dabble in other areas. Not only can users right-click on any link from any other social service, they can actually like and comment on the Instagram picture they were just posted on (and Instabridge can later integrate Instagram’s API). They can also like and share to their own “Instabridge Circles” for when they have an awesome new song they want to hear. The team is thinking about how to allow different categories of sharing, such as “Circles” for shared content, and “Instabridge Screenshots,” for instant screenshots.
In short, Instabridge has built a powerful, instant toolbox for sharing and connecting on the web, and it’s moving to take advantage of its position as the latest company to add Facebook friend sharing and other instant messaging features. The team was quick to invite Instabridge’s investors, including Social Leverage (Chris Hughes), Collaborative Fund, and Chris Sacca (Chris Sacca). Although this isn’t Instabridge’s first time in the blog space, the team first hit the ‘Like Us On Facebook’ system, thanks to Chris Sacca and Chris Hughes.
Naturally, Linden, who runs Instabridge from Australia, says he’ll be using Instabridge not only to create a personal network, but also to try to convert his “very strong Facebook graph.”  In the past year, we’ve seen the startup integrate with over 100 services, including things like Facebook Events, Path, Dropbox, Tumblr, MySpace, Flickr, Path, Livefyre, WordPress and many more.
Instabridge has raised $1.5 million in total from an impressive host of investors, angels and seed investors. Linden says that he expects Instabridge’s mobile apps to go live in a few months, and that the site will reach iOS, Android and iPad shortly.
The company recently completed a successful Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, and as a result, offers the community access to a web dashboard featuring graphs. Users can connect with friends and see when they will be in their groups as well; like tweets, check-ins, and other social activities. As of today, the site has over 2 million users, and Instabridge has added 1 million users total since launching a year ago.
In addition to giving users the option to add their Facebook and Twitter profiles in addition to their personal circles,

 snsos, which works as a competitor with a more direct audience and a broader selection of services. In other words, the goal is to provide something that’s both free and premium in a way that makes sense for most consumers. In other words, the company is focused on letting the power users own the experience and provide the best value for money in the long run. It also offers a variety of features for businesses (like access to APIs and more), but these tend to be in the “free to use” space.
“If you take our approach of ‘free and premium,’ we’re taking the approach of that free-to-use, but if we need something in certain areas, that’s our way of doing it,” explained Haddad.

However, many consumers aren’t really aware that they can get in on a “viral” marketing game. If something is popular like, say a recipe, the potential for the company to market and create more content from the ground up could be just too high a potential win for those interested in adding value to their companies. However, the pricing of these services is relatively low compared with services companies have from the likes of Pinterest. So, there are a number of companies that are launching their own Pinterest marketing strategies, however, as one of the tools that could help to promote the service to the end consumers remains unclear. That said, there’s something going on here and for a number of reasons one should be aware.
But, perhaps, the bigger question becomes how these kinds of services can sell more of their users to the brands that are interested in what they do. While the tools are good and worth a closer look and review, there is little to hold the brand in mind when one considers what others are doing. For most brands, they’ve had to do their due diligence before putting something out, and thus the price tag. Now that Pinterest is available on a number of platforms and an organization that is in the business of monetizing social media marketing, brands can see a market that is becoming less of a barrier to entry, while also getting more use out of that content they want to share.
We’ll be watching to see if this turns out to be a different kind of funnel for brands on Pinterest. Is this a way for companies to create a place where brands can create their own Pinterest marketing strategies, or is this something completely different. We’ll learn more in the next two months."
"Today at the National Convention Center in Philadelphia, Google CEO Sundar Pichai introduced a number of new features, including Google Now for Gmail, Google Apps for Android, the Google+ integration and more. While Pichai shared a lot of details about the upcoming updates to the suite of services, one thing he didn’t say is a timeline for rolling out the Google+ integration.
That’s because Pichai decided that integrating Google+ would be easier than actually implementing the integration using Gmail and all the tools Google currently offers, like Pages and Google+.
Pichai noted that with Google’s larger vision, integrating all three products would take more than one year. So what is it exactly?
In a short, Pichai said that all of this could be done using existing technology, and with the resources he can invest to make it happen. That’s the vision that he spoke about today at the National Convention Center in advance of his Google+ announcement today.
While Pichai gave no indication of a schedule, the conversation about Google+ at the company tends to veer into Google+ and Hangouts, the Google Talk app that Pichai referred to the other day, since Google wants to see a unified product across the products. In particular, he likes to talk about Hangouts, which is in development right now.
With all these talks going on, and Google already committed to integrating all three products this year, it seems to be in the mood to put all of its focus on one area that it can control, rather than pushing Google+ integration in everywhere.
Today’s keynote was really focused on the Google+, Pichai said; how the service would scale to support the scale of organizations that want it.
Pichai also talked about the integration with Google+ and the Google+ for Android integration, which will be rolling out in June."
"After all the noise and confusion that’s consumed the world of big data, Pichai’s talk was unusually forthright. He hinted that while the number of big data queries will likely grow, Pichai wants big business to adopt the technology in order to manage and protect their relationships with a wider range of organizations using all kinds of data.

“When companies are dealing with millions or even hundreds of thousands or hundreds of thousands of entities, and you only really care about 10 people

 can make some money (no sales tax) while others could profit, and it was the most important part of the company’s future growth strategy.
Today, Instagram is announcing its first acquisition in the form of a deal with travel startup TripIt, in which it will pay a $200 million, $55 per share dividend on TripIt’s outstanding shares of common stock.
The deal, it notes in its statement, includes $100 million in debt and a $50 million exchange of common stock to pay the acquisition price, plus the cash, which adds to the $650 million “in the bank” note mentioned above.
TripIt, whose parent company was founded in 2007 as an online marketplace for travel, was the subject of an IPO in May 2010 and raised $15.7 million in debt at the time. It was valued at $13 per share.
TripIt says that today it has over 100 million active users, with 25 million unique users at any one time, and that its marketplaces already generate $60 million in gross merchandise value per year for more than 30 million travelers.
We’ve emailed Google to ask what a Google-acquired company doing the acquisition process will look like, and we’ll update with what we learn. This report and other details related to it have also been confirmed by a source.

"In a rare interview with the FT (search), Tony Parker from Microsoft says Windows Phone is set for its greatest growth yet. In an interview with the paper he tells TechCrunch’s Norman Winkelspecht that Microsoft’s Windows phone handspot has “the chance of expanding in the UK”.
Aka the UK’s Nokia Lumia 520 and 820 smartphones, Microsoft’s Windows Phone mobile OS is the third successive time in the past year picked up a new-year Nokia Lumia.
Aka Windows Phone, Microsoft’s mobile OS was first introduced in February 2010 and launched later that year.
The Windows Phone handset is now (in the parlance) the seventh most popular smartphone OS in the UK (tied with Android).
Winkelspecht makes it plain he says Windows Phone’s ‘app battle‘ has been a long-running itch — going back to Windows Phone 5, the “very mobile” OS has only “become visible”.  Aka Windows Phone’s mobile OS is now a must-have for the platform — with Windows Phone’s Lumia devices topping sales in more than 80 markets in the Q4 quarter.
The Windows Phone platform is now a must-have for Windows Phone, so Nokia’s Lumia 620 sale appears to have kicked the tyres and given a boost to the platform — given it launched the Lumia 620 not one but two Lumia 5.
The Lumia 620’s launch is clearly timed to coincide with the new Lumia flagship Windows Phone 7 devices coming on-sale. The Lumia 5 was announced just yesterday but the Lumia 520 is due to go on sale in the second half of this year at Microsoft’s October conference.
Winkelspecht says sales of the Lumia 520 are “impressive.” “We see strong growth in the UK in the short duration of the year,” he notes. “Clearly Windows Phone is a key part of our sales as the market continues to grow steadily for the past 12 months.”
The iPhone maker has a new flagship iOS 10 device, the iPhone 5c, out this Monday.
In the market survey Winkelspecht notes Windows Phone’s “app battle” has been a long time coming — with Nokia’s Windows Phone legacy showing “strong consumer appetite” for Windows Phone. Winkelspecht notes Nokia’s Windows Phone 7 legacy also appears to be firmly established with Windows Phone 7 owners, so Windows Phone 7 is now “the second choice” OS.
Winkelspecht notes Windows Phone 7 has not been a massive seller so Windows Phone 7 has not really had a strong enough early hit to suggest a Windows Phone 8 device can emerge from here. Winkelspecht notes, however, that the Windows Phone 8 launch has pushed Windows Phone into the upper echelon.
“The Windows Phone 8 launch has given the platform a strong initial market share in the UK, and the Windows Phone 8 launch and the Windows Phone 8.1 release both have improved the smartphone OS representation of Windows Phone,” the analyst adds.
Winkelspecht said today’s Windows Phone 8 launch has been “more a media event than a software launch” with Microsoft holding it at its own "

In the UK there is a constant stream of startups getting traction on Kickstarter: from

 2012, though there was some growth in the last year. Sales growth was up, too. Sales director Steve Loughlin (formerly a vice president and general manager of IBM) said the company will generate revenue next year from its platform, which also includes a “very strong suite of business services” for SMEs.
TechCrunch’s Ingrid Lunden gave me a quick demo of the new platform yesterday. One of the big focuses is “the ability for companies to manage multiple applications in one cloud environment.” It helps companies keep all of their data centers, on-prem and in the cloud separate from each other. A company can create a private cloud with multiple apps, then switch out different public ones with the same or similar ones.
Loughlin suggested that as the cloud matures and companies focus on their infrastructure and applications, it becomes more important to separate the management between multiple environments. To solve this challenge, companies are now embracing the cloud to manage server and database environments. They can have multiple cloud environments and run multiple apps in an Oracle or Heroku cloud.
“The way this works is that Oracle will take your application and put it into a cloud environment, and Heroku takes care of all of that infrastructure and database-related things,” he said. He told me the Heroku environment has the capability to keep its app updated in multiple environments, including Amazon’s AWS.
Loughlin was also particularly excited about the Heroku environment when it lets you use cloud-based management tools without having to worry about maintaining Heroku environments. The Heroku environment is meant to serve as an environment for deploying production workloads to cloud environments. The Heroku environment can also serve as a staging environment for other environments and to support other cloud environments.
The Heroku environment appears at the bottom of the Heroku dashboard, and is designed to let developers create app and business environments without having to worry about any infrastructure management. Developers can use a simple set of Heroku and Cloud Management APIs to create an app environment without using their Heroku tools. Developers can also use Heroku’s support for deploying apps to Heroku.
“This is really for the enterprise,” she said.
In addition to its support for Android, Heroku also today added support for the Amazon Web Services platform. Heroku also now integrates the Heroku environment with Rackspace. This lets developers run Heroku in the cloud without worrying about any infrastructure overhead.
Loughlin gave me a demo of the Heroku app server. The Heroku app server has a single-purpose development model. Developers can develop apps without using Heroku, and Heroku handles everything for them.
Heroku faces competition from a number of other cloud-based platforming companies, including Heroku, Cloudstack, CloudstackHub and Cloudtamper. In particular, Heroku competes with the Heroku environment, which is similar to Heroku’s environment. Sheoku’s customers tend to do not have multiple programming languages as Heroku supports all languages. Sheoku’s customers have the benefit of using Heroku’s support for multiple programming languages. It also competes with Cloudtamper, another Heroku competitor.
Loughlin said Heroku was born out of Heroku’s founder’s experience: “Heroku is heroku’s first step to managing the enterprise. Heroku is the best place to go to make sure your entire company builds a development environment that allows you to quickly build out your application and make a business out of it.”"
"Forget about the rest of Microsoft’s news today. The company kicked off a big reorganization that has included a reduction in costs across the whole company. Now the question will be whether any of that new lean, lean Microsoft is able to become a different company that can change the company in the years ahead.
Today’s restructuring is a departure from Microsoft’s current structure, according to a regulatory filing. The filing doesn’t really elaborate that the company is separating itself. It’s more of a personnel decision, according to the filing that has yet to be officially issued.
If the filing is true, it comes on the heels of a new Microsoft (Microsoft) being formed earlier this week to handle much of its online enterprise efforts. In the past year Microsoft acquired Yammer in a massive deal that appears to be worth between $14 and $16 billion (if the financial part of that deal is accurate) to strengthen its enterprise efforts.
It’s still not clear whether Yammer had a business valuation of more in the last day of its existence that we knew. It comes on the heels of the rebranding of Microsoft’s online sales services to Microsoft’s online sales services instead of the Office-centric environment.
The filing also says that the reorganization

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Web-based businesses, which are often based on a lot of information on the web — like your company, your employee database, the state of the restaurant, and more —  now have a very similar set of options to those in the enterprise. They can now quickly get real-time information on what is going on with their employees and, really, more advanced monitoring tools for their teams. (And they can even hire IT pros.)
While SaaS management has made it so that sales people can tell customers things like when your software has been installed on a company’s servers, for example, the same data is no longer available to the rest of the organization. Enterprise SaaS companies have to rely on third-party services. To be clear, this is still an important aspect of the process, but the company has also made sure that its new SaaS capabilities include other types of integrations, like a Salesforce-like “Scheduler” that can tell customer analysts at a meeting when things have been up-and-to-the-right.

Salesforce itself has become a king of being SaaS-integrated software and has a huge stake in the evolution of SaaS. In February it announced a strategic partnership with SAP, where it will integrate Salesforce’s CRM solutions into SaaS products and give away SAP’s data analytics services and more.
Salesforce notes that it’s now integrating the Sales Channel Platform, SAP’s enterprise communications platform known as Sting.
Salesforce says that the platform can help customers build a Salesforce CRM system based on Sting, and it can also help them build Salesforce Calendar and Salesforce Invoice (which lets customers attach reminders, track payments, and more).
“Salesforce is committed to supporting leading enterprise SaaS applications,” said Marc Benioff, Salesforce CEO. “The Sales channel Platform is designed to help you create innovative products people need, and SAP is a proven platform of choice for Salesforce’s enterprise SaaS applications. Together, we will be able to provide customers with greater value — and convenience – than ever before.”
SAP is also going to give away some more data to Salespeople using Sting that it will be sharing with salespeople and analysts. That includes the ability to add a new note to a Salesperson’s calendar and send an email to the salesperson with the information like the contact info and the date, which is then passed to the CRM system.
“Today’s Salesforce Platform is the first platform to support SAP CRM applications and will be the first to make SAP CRM applications available to your business,” said John Ranjan Das, SVP for Business Development. “The first to offer SAPCRM products that are integrated with Salesforce™’s sales service is SAP CRM.”
Salesforce notes that this is the first time it’s releasing data from the Sales Channel Platform.
“You can think of the Sales Channel Platform as the data-driven side of Salesforce CRM,” said Brian Norgard, SVP for Sales. “This is the first time Salesforce is making direct data available to customers directly and that is a very exciting development in the industry and it is a sign of the future of Salesforce CRM.”
As Salesforce tries to get more of its big enterprise services and cloud businesses moving from the cloud, companies are really trying to move away from the cloud.
“Salesforce will create a new paradigm for computing, cloud infrastructure, and cloud communication,” noted Bill Schott, Salesforce CEO, said in the release. “This will bring new intelligence and new capabilities to the sales person’s life and, as we continue to grow and improve our cloud computing capabilities, we will continue to invest in creating innovative technology that will help sales people do business.”"
"When I think back to the early nineties, I recall one man who was living by the river in San Francisco Bay. He was a banker at one day. He and a girlfriend, then a manager at a real estate business, started traveling around the world, and got to see various countries side-by-side.
And when I think about today’s technology, that man is almost entirely gone. But his stories were valuable for many years to me — and he brought me a few insights into what startups and accelerators can look like.
Before I started my career, I had a major interest in tech, technology and venture capital. I’ve invested in companies like Slack, Spotify, Pinterest, Airbnb, Spotify, Uber, and Foursquare, among others. Many of these companies have yet to break through, and the ones that have been successful so far are centered around the idea of an enterprise

 been the second-most-popular enterprise app, with more than 1 million users. The company will be looking to double over the line with more of its core services as it grows, including support and monitoring. 
To date, Yandex has taken the approach of working in-house — with the creation of a joint venture with the Russian Federation over 100 patents for Russian search technology, and the co-owners of Togolabs, a Russian search engine — with the team focusing on growth rather than market penetration. With that strategy in place, the company is now looking to accelerate its growth into global markets."
"You may have heard the news that Google has been laying off staff in Waterloo’s public sector. But another big technology company is doing cutting costs in the same area, but Google Ventures-backed Innovation Works is a different story. The organization was created by a number of smaller tech companies including Gogobotels, which did $1.5 million in revenue on its platform last year as well as Gnip, which has a mobile messaging app that you can use in the same way that Slack or HipChat works for Slack. The latest member is Google.
Google announced today that it will open up new Innovation Works offices in Toronto and Amsterdam to help it build out its efforts. “By bringing its innovation and machine learning teams and talented engineers to the companies that innovate with Google, we can make investments in their startups and build their businesses,” it said in a press release, which Google confirmed.
The news comes hot on the heels of the departures of a number of high-profile Google employees in recent days. That includes the departure of Google’s Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Facebook, who joined Google with full effect in July of 2015. And just yesterday (in a message on that same day), there was the appointment of two new top execs who were not on any official board at Google.
In total Google has now posted one change in the leadership structure of Innovation Works’ organization, with John O’Farrell joining its board along with the departure of Richard Wong from Google Ventures after he left last month. The last time O’Farrell was appointed was in December, 2013.

All of these moves are aimed at laying the ground for more changes to the business model around Innovation Works, which is a not-for-profit organization that it is part of. The organization is also part of the legacy venture investment system, where there are often investments made by larger companies and other individuals. This gives that larger companies like Google that sometimes invest in legacy companies, such as when it created the $140 million fund in 2013.
For what it’s worth, Google has shown no intention of walking away from the other legacy businesses."
"If your boss has an office, you could open a Google Street View-like video feature to watch a lot of what people are saying to you. So today, Google is taking its Street View team members and its Street View app under Picnic Health’s Google X lab, and it could soon give you the same kind of 360-degree view of city streets.
The Street View feature will let you see the streets in front of you, as well as the ones in the opposite direction. It also gives you the option of seeing everything for a street or lane by way of a “Street View” app. You can toggle off and on which direction you are looking at to turn the feature on and off, but it’s not clear yet if there are any design improvements to make it even easier to switch.
To date Google has offered a similar view of streets for a wide range of features, such as panoramic panoramas, Street View titles, 3D streets and even Google’s Street View app, which can give you a virtual tour of a given area for a given moment of time, and then bring up the map to give a live map, or a street view.

Picnic Health is an ambitious new start for the company that began with a health tech company after it acquired public transit search technology company Search Street View in 2010. It recently raised $3.3 million in seed-funding.
But like many tech companies out there, the company has been operating in stealth for the past several months, before announcing its partnership with IBM in February.
Since then, it’s been focusing on getting partners to use its technology. This included a new partnership with transportation companies in Asia that will let it use data on their stops, schedules and other data to make the best use of its API. A deal will be launched in the U.S. and Asia next month, for example, says Picnic. Picnic also says it doesn’s ready to tackle the “huge” street view problem in the U.S.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
An a team of eight years with a good friend of mine, Matt Witheiler, wrote up this short post on Hacker News in advance of his first week at work in one of the city’s new public Wi-Fi hotspots:
Witheiler has previously worked at the now-shuttered company EAT Club, founded by a friend of his father from Colorado, and later joined in a class at University Park in Maryland while volunteering for the team. That group taught him computer science, and led him to work in a number of jobs after school — he earned his first paycheck as an engineer on the airline-parrot business (where he worked for Airpooler).
Hacker News notes that Witheiler was the first to realize he wanted to start his own company, and, once he did, he told his friends that he thought it was an “incredible coincidence” that he would be able to come up with the idea right away. He and his co-founder Nick Kagan, meanwhile, came to work for a few weeks on the spot, then they heard that many customers were saying they were expecting to get their WiFi signals for free. While TechCrunch has been at the site on Friday for the past week, we finally saw some activity from the network today. Witheiler said the network has already been live for two weeks, though he says that the network will open up for an extended period of time, with prices ranging from $6 to $30 per day on a month (not per line), depending on the subscriber.
Here are some photos of the network in action:
You can read more about the Wi-Fi network in some of the comments here, and at one point there appeared to be a link to the Google Drive store showing an open access code. That could mean that there could be something a little more in it. Maybe it’s something big at the airport or a McDonalds, or it could just be a little older people getting in through a front door that connects them to people who are moving or returning to the network, or there could be something else entirely.
Witheiler himself has worked with a couple of companies that have set up their own Wi-Fi networks and are now trying to figure out what kind of service he can start out with. The company, he notes, also has the code up and running and there are plans to launch at more airports before the end of 2012. Witheiler notes that he will be traveling back and forth between Boston and Denver right now, and that there are plans to also open up the network this summer.
One thing he is not making clear is that he plans to charge for the service and services on the airport WiFi network. If anything, it seems like he is basically going to have to get a passcode to work — although he tells me he has been approached by hackers who offer to pay him, that seems like a little “weird.” In any event, Hackthenetwork’s Witheiler notes that he is ready to make his moves on his terms.
While Witheiler has never commented on this story before, he has confirmed Hackthenetwork’s comments in today’s interview.
I wonder if Witheiler is getting scared of doing his own advertising? Witheiler suggests that just the one guy who has decided to stand up and defend his company against “all the silly bullshit that flies on the web” will need to “come out the other side.” As for the ads, he says, “they can get really annoying.” And, of course, he adds, “they are being watched because they are highly targeted.”
He points out, “In the current network environment, there are tons of places where you can advertise, there will be more for us ads than ads.”
Hackthenetwork says it will continue to pursue litigation in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, pending. It will, incidentally, be moving its headquarters to New York.

"Vine is a video sharing application, and as it stands, its most interesting feature is its user interface – that seemingly endless scroll of animated, lifelike videos just waiting to be disrupted by a user.
That’s not to say that Vine videos don’t have their place in the overall web pornography pie (“prohibition will get us out of here.” You’re welcome to make your own Vine videos, as they’re all just waiting to be enjoyed.)
However, Vine is an app that’s about letting users upload videos to an online space, without having to have a large audience to actually drive traffic there. In other situations, Vine is not an attractive site for advertisers – and if it were, that might change if it wasn’t for a number of other reasons.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
s-no-tampery-up, it would have to be a very small investment to get to profitability, of which there are no small payments on the scale of a big enterprise.
We don’t yet know how many of these 3D printers are in use at the moment, beyond reports in the thousands. While some of the smaller models appear to be for prototyping, others — including the larger 3D printers — are for commercial use, such as as the Electrovoice 3D-printed drone.
The move comes in the wake of the rise of other 3D printer innovations, such as the ScanJet-designed printer, or its 3D printer-as-a-pilot program, which gives 3D print makers a cheaper alternative for their designs to 3D printer-as-a-service or Shapeways for a fixed fee (around $400/square meter).
3D printers are also used to 3D design printed objects. So in other words, there is a cheaper 3D printer out there that is not a 3D printer or mass-produced 3D printer. The point is, if you are using 3D printers in tandem in many factories then this is how you win — and 3D printers are the perfect tools for selling industrial goods, such as high-end electronics products. And to be clear, selling industrial goods is a vast swathe of activity that can be carried out by anyone and everyone — just by doing the right things with them.
In the same way, these printers act as a low-cost alternative to 3D printing — and that’s where Shapeways is hoping to become a popular service by offering 3D print orders for $9.99. Shapeways says that it has been “amazed” by the response it has received since opening up order service last week, with orders for the first weekend sales being more than double what it had been asking for, with orders already exceeding $600.
The move underscores where 3D printing is fitting into the wider manufacturing ecosystem. Shapeways points to the rise of the maker movement as a way of moving more advanced and affordable manufacturing from mass-produced manufacturing to more advanced machines.
“You can see that this was something [manufacturing] companies and people who have been thinking a little bit about the consumerization of manufacturing,” said Shapeways co-founder Rob Hutter.
“You can see this is a way for people to make manufacturing products that cost less and so much more, that are more accessible than a factory. It’s not really a production tool. You are just slicing and typing and clicking, just as a human being can. And that’s kind of the natural interaction that we want to see” he added.

The Shapeways service operates on a freemium model: users will pay a monthly fee for a service that offers 200 printed jobs, which the company hopes will get them manufactured enough to start feeding them into its platform. Shapeways charges partner companies for the printed jobs that are sent directly to customers’ homes. The service is currently only open for orders placed Monday to Friday.
The company is not disclosing the full amount of revenue it makes from the operation, or how many users it has, who are mostly just people who are happy enough to use it for a little freetime. However, it is promising to be able to double revenues this year as it scales up, with the number of 3D printers on its platform growing.
And because Shapeways is a marketplace for 3D printing hardware and software — and it sold its printer business to 3D printery for around $120 million last year — it would clearly be a pretty attractive acquisition for any 3D printer company looking to upgrade on the software side to a more capable and affordable 3D printer.
The move is another key part of Shapeways’ growth strategy, bringing more makers onto the platform through new features such as the ability to sell directly to customers. The new Shapeways platform continues to evolve, too. In the latest version (4.5), the company introduced a “Shapeways Marketplace,” which allows users to buy directly from Shapeways, rather than third-party sellers.
In the future, a number of competitors may emerge for Shapeways. And they too would like to compete in the broader manufacturing space.
One possibility is the likes of Stratasys and Makerbot, which recently closed a $3.5 billion funding round. And it will be important for Shapeways to continue growing its business, but also avoid any hiccups when a hardware company goes under as a maker."

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
. In December, Facebook added a new option that will let you post “Let me know what you did, my post didn’t get seen.”
The feature is similar to Facebook’s recent Suggested Friends feature that lets you ask your friends to “Like” your Page.
There’s been plenty of pressure over Facebook users posting publicly, with many people claiming they don’t want them to get their opinions for their Pages, and Facebook’s shares going down. Facebook is going to have to keep the lights on this for the rest of the days, though some could consider this as more of a test than an actual live roll out."
"In a candid conversation with TechCrunch, Facebook engineering manager Ishan Shupam said today about how Facebook used its Graph Search feature.
His answers revealed a key part of Facebook’s plans – including the future of Graph Search.
During our discussion, Shupam went into great detail about how the experimental search engine was built, but Facebook engineers were not in a position to test the app, he said.
During these early tests, Facebook searched for “photos” on all of its users’ profiles and didn’t like any of the suggestions. It then set up an experiment where people were allowed to select a friend from their contacts and they would see a little box suggesting their friend’s choices. Some friends chose it, some weren’t. 

This system of choosing a friend is also an important part of the search engine: “If all the network users who got the experiment were on mobile, we should all be on mobile. We will reach the majority of global users who still didn’t have a browser.
“If we had a way to select who to let into the experiment what we would have done”, Shupam said.

You can read more details about the tests here.


After you make a choice, your search results will appear in the tab of your profile, though it may not be visible on mobile until you are back on mobile. If you want to see if it was right there, this is also how you find it online, too.
The whole experiment is reminiscent of what Apple has done with Spotlight search for other parts of the iOS operating system. Shupam pointed out that Facebook did this to test with its own results, but there are plenty of results in Spotlight, like a bunch of photos of cats.
The answer to the Question: Why should people click through on something when all of the options are so many?
The most recent version of the Facebook search engine only returned results from profiles two years ago, but Shupam had this to say: “In the search engine years it’s not that there are lots of answers. There are lots of sources, a ton — you can see this with friends of mine who got this, like they’ve been looking for answers on how to do it for years,” he explained.
Why has Facebook taken this approach? Because it had developed many other queries in its search engine in the past, and the results were generally less useful than a search for “photos of my cats.”

“I don’t make a comment on what Google does but on what Facebook is doing,” he explained later.
He said that a search “for things that don’t have to do with search” would generate a very different question, like a search for my “photograph”. That wouldn’t return the same question, but someone could answer like “my cats photos”. (That is, if you search like they’re asking in the search box, you’ll get photos from the web-based photo gallery of my cat. I didn’t see photos from my site’s Facebook photos and I don’t expect to search for a search for “photos of my cat.”)
Still, when asked about what people find in Google searches on the web, it often returns more search results than that people might want to answer. If Facebook wanted to search the web using what Google does and FacebookSearch.com, the search engine might have gotten the answer on Google. It’s unclear why Facebook has chosen to return the original query after looking through a number of different alternatives.
Update: Just to be sure, I haven’t used Facebook Search in the past and I didn’t see this. So if I saw an other search that I wanted to ask a question about photos of my cat, I could use it right now.

Shupam also said that the new search engine is more for people who need a more detailed question than the results.

ha. If your company is doing well, you might want to increase the number of employees whose job you want to do. If they’re not doing well, you might want to get them to work a little harder. And if they don’t do a lot, you might want to hire a COO or a sales or marketing person.
“I’m actually doing this stuff pretty carefully,” she tells me.
“There are a couple of things.” she says, talking specifically about the challenge of finding qualified sales teams and executives. “Sales is a really difficult area to think about because at most point, every dollar matters.”
Awayz doesn’t just want to fix that problem, of course, by laying out ways to make sales, marketing and every department a more unified operation. As one person, she says, that’s not going to be possible by focusing on one area: sales, marketing, sales, or sales, or a combination thereof.
“If you understand the way sales and marketing and what’s changing, it’s all really about the whole thing,” she says. “Part of what people are doing.”
That is, in most organizations today, sales teams and people spend a ton of their time in sales centers, marketing and sales operations. If you take another look at who’s actually running things, that’s usually to help sell the company, or, in fact, that’s not a huge part of the way it works. This is where Awayz has a unique perspective: not just focusing on sales but on the entire organization, including sales, marketing and data-driven decision-making.
So how has it grown? While it’s grown pretty significantly over the years, Awayz has always been focused on customers where it has managed to produce results in spite of its often slower-than-average growth rates. “We’ve had a good long-term success rate,” Awayz tells me, but without naming specific customers, she declined to share any numbers, and she was not willing to reveal Awayz’s total customer count. “We have always focused on our key client and we always want to do more,” she told me. “We’re not looking to get our name out. We want to be really good at what we’re doing.”"
"Today Box CEO Aaron Levie is launching a new cloud collaboration service BoxOneCloud as an enterprise mobile app, something that is not only very different from that of Box, but also may actually be a sign of how Box (a new enterprise startup, in itself a collaboration tool) is actually doing real things. This may explain why he decided to focus on that area first, and why it would seem appropriate to use that infrastructure to make a business tool the engineer-and-man.
The BoxOneCloud app will be made available to work in office apps within a broader corporate structure and the broader world. Initially, this will include the Office products Office Office Work for you and your team and Office Power, to let you quickly view work from your documents, contacts and calendar data and then work together when you need that information to be collated in this way to create one complete experience.

Levie sees CloudAs an integration as an integration within a work flow for many types of business applications. There has always been an integration for customer-customers using your Office365 software — in fact, an integration for that was something we saw in the lab at Google, for how this could actually be used to integrate apps.
In Box’s example above, if you are working on the same file as you would at Microsoft with OneDrive, you can have that file open in Box, as well. When you have an update to a document you want to share with a colleague and they can edit it directly within the file, rather than asking you to download an update.
Levie said there are some other uses from the company’s other customers. He noted that they had already been integrating with Box on their internal software platform, which was previously just an application for consumers to try out and test apps. “We get much bigger than just of Office – it makes more sense to use Box internally,” he explained.
And what’s more, if you have a document already on Dropbox, and you really want to keep that file on Box when your team changes to another app, then the existing file remains in the Box directory.
Levie is not disclosing any numbers of what the sales may be

 ancient a “digital book market” of sorts, with a range of applications for publishers and authors, such as book, film, TV and now games; e-books, including both software and hardware; apps by publishers and developers, including, notably, apps to help gamers monetize their IP; and of course other genres.
As with the rest, it seems that the idea here is that this could become an opportunity for both publishers to better engage readers and developers, to boost user engagement on their books and also to attract publishers into the platform in areas of their choosing. In turn they could benefit from sharing content with users, who would then become readers. (That could also be good for the mobile web — in a sense, an ebook reader could become a writer with knowledge about the topic across web and mobile platforms — so it’s not surprising that Scribd is now working on an iPhone app that allows users to interact with the app directly — see pic below). Scribd says its iOS app already has more than 3 million users.
The app is free to use, and Scribd writes on the back-half, “without compensation for any user who downloads the Scribd app by using a mobile device.”"
"We recently caught up with a group of tech companies and found some worth their salt, sharing their thoughts on the state of the European VCs and the challenges to form relationships between regional players. The consensus was generally positive and some interesting insights, although some companies were quite candid about their failures and some were just plain wrong on a very basic issue.
Startups in any business, whether it’s health, education, energy, or anything in between, are not strangers to European success, and as a few venture partners here and there should point out at the outset: just because you’re not successful doesn’t mean you are doomed to fail; on the contrary.
However, this can also be confusing because the average venture capitalist doesn’t necessarily make a good ‘venture’.
As we all know, the typical European VC thinks differently when it comes to deals and where exits are to come. They are passionate investors who care deeply about what’s going to be a good business, and they think relentlessly about how to achieve the best outcome for their investments.
I’ve spoken to many European heads of VCs as well as entrepreneurs for over a year, and they’ve all been working on a similar mindset.
Most European VCs aren’t CEOs or heads of businesses. Their job is to bring together a large funding team with a great product vision and a big dream, and to assemble a strong, disciplined product team and take to the market.
Yet, in my experience, many founders, particularly the most ambitious ones, have struggled to develop their core business and haven’t yet figured out how to do that.
The more entrepreneurs you invest in, the more that matters.
And just like any entrepreneurial journey, many do not come with the answer right that they were looking for.
We’ve all been in startup bootcamps for as long as we can remember, and the vast majority of us — we’ll take you through the different phases to come up with a new venture, or, if we’re lucky enough, a new business.
Sometimes these lessons are delivered as painful truths as we’re forced to face, like “if you’re not going to take risks,” or “if you’re already profitable,” or “if you’re a good CEO, you need to be at the helm.”
In other cases, we’ll learn that the right answer, even after extensive hours of wrangling a big business, is something we all have to learn.
In Silicon Valley, where founders and investors are often not at the same table, and the best venture partners are not operating in a vacuum in our culture, the difference between “winning” and “failing” can often be stark. It’s never good to take the role of CEO when the team is failing, and often we take it upon ourselves, even when we know that we can’t do it any better.
We all know how “harder said than done” makes for a less-than-five-times-a-round post startup.
Many European entrepreneurs and investors take that “hard-core” mindset to heart, and they’re often more inclined to work together on projects, rather than individual problems. And that’s not too surprising. Entrepreneurs spend time thinking at the intersection of technology, product, and business in order to identify areas of opportunity and make a bold purchase — and there’s not much that’s easy in the Silicon Valley world, and vice versa, when that

’s own apps for people to use, not just the news ones the startup offers itself. This is the first big push in this area, with apps for iOS and Android enabling the “journalism” aspect of the service.
The problem with the app is clearly with the social components — it’s hard for people to get news via an app without being distracted by other sources. But it will potentially work in solving a big problem for a news user — missing news when it’s relevant because it can’t be.
The service is not just designed to serve the needs of news organisations — so much as it serves the needs of users. In addition to its social functions, including the ability to communicate with correspondents and present stories, the News Lens can be used for other features.
Here’s how it describes itself:
There is a clear interest in this new push to offer people a different way to access news today. That is an area that the likes of Flipboard and Zite have tried and failed to tackle. Indeed, there are plenty of startups in this areas, although none of them seem to feel that they’ve cracked the code in terms of providing a highly visual news experience, where news organizations want news that can be consumed via an app rather than a website or a news-only service.
The news delivery service is going to come in two flavours: one that is free, providing instant news updates, and one that’s paywalled.
To use the free version of the app, you just take a picture of the news feed and the News Lens then apply its filters to it and voilà, you get a pretty slick-looking news summary, which is how Flipboard currently formats the stories. You can access the new versions of the stories from news organisations that are written by journalists, publishers, editors, and others. You can also download individual pieces if you want to get a full-screen experience.
It has also provided the following statement from CEO Oliver Luckett: “News Leeks is designed to help provide consumers with access to news instantly, without the need to rely on open aggregators and other third-party, third-party editors. In this way, News Leeks allows readers to consume news and the News Lens enables them to use the app in a completely different way, helping provide a full stack of insight and action to their readers. This is a groundbreaking approach to news which complements our goal of bringing people the most relevant, quality, relevant and engaging news service.”

The new app launches today in the U.K., Ireland, Spain and Canada."
"Crowdsourced journalism startup Reputation.com has raised $2.1 million in seed crowdfunding for the first time out of hundreds of thousands of investors in its seed round. That puts the startup on an extremely short list of potential competitors, and a market that remains largely unmonopolized. The new round, which also had participation from TechStars and others, brings the latest round of funding to $3.1 million to date for the company.
According to founders Eugene Choi and Haiyun Lee, the startup will use its seed for the U.S.-based initial launch of a new product, including a “pro-tip” product for enterprise search and discovery, followed by a product to build a mobile device for the enterprise. It will also build a mobile web app where users can scan political news headlines to verify sources and identify the sources which are in news, and then upload their own images of those news items.
Meanwhile, Reputation.com is planning to launch a new platform for news aggregation, and will focus on its Web app for search, which will be able to include other features to help readers sift through a wider pool of content.
A quick scan of Reputation.com news headlines in the past week of tech sites and online websites is not that unusual – Google Trends already has an analytics product which indexes news content. However, Reputation.com has the advantage of working closely with its content providers to set up the algorithms involved so its content is not just appearing in the news feeds of its users, but also in the hands of its users via an API.
Reputation.com’s seed investors, which include Andreessen Horowitz, Andreessen Horowitz, Accel, Google Ventures, and others, come from an impressive list of investors, which includes Accel’s Yuri Milner, SV Angel, CrunchFund and others. The startup was founded in 2010 by Curtis Llewellyn, formerly chief innovation officer and a principal at Accel who has since left the firm, which was acquired in 2014 by Thomson Reuters.

Llewellyn told TechCrunch that the funding would be used for “accelerated research and

 because, again, to give itself some early bird cred for being on this ground floor, so that it doesn’t need to come with a huge number of users, something the service doesn’t currently have, in terms of time and money. Plus, it may well appeal to a bunch of existing e-commerce users, particularly to women.
“We’re in the early design phases, so we’ll be building them in house in order to make them right,” he says. He says that the aim is to have these ships ready by September or early October.
To get the service ready, it’s planning to use “a bunch of tricks” to trick the software into thinking that it should. Specifically, he says it will be building a series of hacks to increase the frequency of the use of the product, with the next goal being to “introduce a brand new way of using it” in the form of a third screen experience.
(The first mock-ups will be designed in Korea, but you’ll also be able to order the service internationally so it looks and feels just right when you get a packet of those.)
At its basic, most basic core level is probably a simple ‘kickbox’ that includes two buttons to access a menu — in fact these are two physical buttons, one on the top panel and one on the bottom. When you tap one of them, a menu is displayed on the device, and when you’re done with that you’ve tapped “next”, and then the device cycles through a list of other options.
“We’ve had a lot of thought on this, and we have lots of teams focused on prototypes and prototypes,” says Numan. “No one really focused on the design of the product, just on the development of the software. It took a really long time because of the time savings, but the idea was to take the time to get to the next level and get the experience that feels the most natural.”
These hacks are not the final design — these prototypes were built over a month, according to the co-founder — but Numan says there are other prototypes that were built over the same timeframe, for instance adding in features at the bottom or doing something in between the list and the first screen.
“We have a lot of company and community working on prototypes to actually make it on, but that’s typically something small, and you also need a lot of beta testers to get things done,” he adds. “You create your prototype, you build it, you run it for a couple of years and then we’ve figured out some things and some tests we’ve implemented in some cases to make sure these ideas work and we have put them into production form within about 12 month.”
“I’m going to be working out some kinks in the programming to make this as clean and easy as possible, and to also create these tools — we have a working design tool, and also some tools to develop those interactions between things, and we’ll also probably have a lot of ideas about how to actually program this,” he adds.
He says that in addition to working on these initial hacks — testing the software and launching a beta program with a few hundred users — the team will be continuing with its overall work on “big ideas we’re developing.”
It won’t be talking specifics just yet. But there’s still quite a lot of green space for the team to work on, given that the initial concept of ParcelForce is still very much in the early stages.
“We’ve had various ideas about how to prototype the software,” says Numan. “We’ve had some concept about how to build in user-data, and we’d also been thinking of how to prototype the design elements. So we have quite a lot of ideas on the ground that we want to add.”
In terms of what the team is working on now is further iterations of the design tools. It’s not going to give general release yet, “but we can share a lot of details about the implementation stages of the project that we’ve been working on,” he says."
"This morning Box announced that it would launch an API based on the Kubernetes open container platform Kerlin, and that it would integrate its container services into its Kerlin DevOps platform.
The API would give developers a way to integrate their applications and other services into a distributed toolbox for the enterprise, the company said, including a set of integrations that would include tools for managing multi-container deployments, a better way to manage the lifecycle process,

What makes the new iPhone different from its predecessors?
“One of the big things is that it’s got a better camera,” says Andrew Dew. That’s what everyone, except the iPhone 5c, has had to say.
The iPhone 5c has a 12.9-megapixel, f/2.0 lens with a four-point AF system, and f/1.5 aperture. That means you can take even better pictures even in low-light settings.
The new iPhone has also a fingerprint scanner, which activates when you hold your finger over the scanner bar. The scanner works best with the front camera, and also acts as a security code.
With these capabilities, the phone is capable of offering 4K videos, or 360-degree panoramis. There’s also video stabilization, which basically means you can do the most common things that you can do with your virtual reality headset. Plus, you can share the video on social networks — with the 360-degree bar helping with the 360 degree experience.
What’s even more impressive than this feature list is that it’ll even take 10 seconds more for users to load a recipe and also take 20% more steps to navigate to a given page. It doesn’t seem like a big deal after all, especially since it’s already one of the more popular tech experiences on the planet.

What is the new iPhone 5c?
It’s worth noting that the iPhone 5c comes in two colors: gold and white. The gold version costs $19.99 and is available now for U.S. buyers.
The gold iPhone comes in two colors, gold and white. The gold iPhone will be on sale on June 26, and the white iPhone will be available through the end of June, while the gold iPhone is slated for July 12.
Interestingly, the iPhone 5c will also offer 3D Touch, allowing you to do things like swipe and pinch to pan around different angles. You can do this from the “More” menu in 3D Touch, and it has an additional feature for changing the angle of the pan or changing the perspective of the pan.

Other upgrades with the iPhone upgrade include the improved design, including a flat-folding system, the new “Archive” feature on the Home screen which allows you to keep a backup folder organized, and the “Quick” feature which makes it possible to share all your photos from many social networks.
Plus, Apple has improved the camera application, with what’s typically a very basic but powerful new camera in an app-improved version from 2D Frontback in v11 of iOS 8.
Other than the main iPhone upgrade, the upgrade looks simple enough. You can connect it with your broadband, it charges by default, and it doesn’t require any external cables to play with.
The new model is much improved over the iPhone 5, and should offer better pictures and better performance overall."
"I’ve been writing about smart home hubs for a while now, including hub that claim to connect to all your devices, including smart knobs, and more.
Now, I’ve learned, it works.
The Ubiheba smart lock is a smart lock to lock/unlock an entire room. And, while not the biggest lock in the world, I still felt it was a good alternative to the standard mechanical smart lock — or, for that matter, the “me too” system.
Here’s how it works:
Once the Ubiheba smart lock is paired with a Smart app (for both iPhone and Android), the new device is able to connect wirelessly to your home Wi-Fi network; then, when you try to open it, it will perform the unlocking and activation process automatically (with the help of smart lock technology from Ubiheba.com), just like any other smart lock.
The team has also gone to the Amazon playbook and developed the Ubiheba lock through a partnership with the ecommerce and tech community site. The Smart lock is part of the Amazon Hardware Labs program in Palo Alto, courtesy of Amazon’s partnership with 1,500 startups.
It will be available for pre-order, which means it’s available nationwide in the United States.
In the Ubiheba, you choose five separate lock modes, including a manual mode, a short-range mode, and short-range mode. The locking system can lock as hard as 4 inches, and offers two different levels of strength (hard, medium, safe) — the stronger is better, but the weaker makes the keystroke too harder (harder, safe) — and

 that it can help consumers create, distribute, and then sell and buy their own goods from their computer’s desktop.
The product is being positioned against the rise of digital commerce and the growing power of the Amazon’s purchasing decisions.
When I said “mobile at the point of retail,” I was more kidding about having to pull my phone out to scan credit cards.
Today, consumers will scan their credit card, pay online, and even interact with a cloud app that automatically sorts (and aggregates) their credit card numbers. Then, with a click of a button on the side of the screen, they click and download the appropriate links to make a purchase in the Cloud Connected App – or click on a product for on-demand pickup on the Web.
Not only do the merchants have more data and a better idea of the traffic that’s passing between mobile apps (and potentially what kind of activity customers want), it also helps them get to the point of sharing information back with retailers and other businesses. For them, this allows them to improve targeting and display, as well as a way to measure consumer demand.
The technology in this new mobile commerce technology is also powered by a lot of data about what people are doing on their phone.
And it’s a problem that the big companies have known all too well.
Microsoft in the past has been looking at how it could improve its mobile businesses by building mobile shopping apps that it could license directly and sell to businesses, similar to what Square and others (the “Square” model) have been doing.
“Square has been a great example of an example of a good solution by a good company,” said Paul Loukman, senior vice president, Microsoft’s CFO, in a statement. “With the launch of new mobile-based payment capabilities coming from our Bing Cloud, businesses can deliver mobile commerce experiences, and while this product and service is now available on the Nokia Lumia smartphones, we will continue to take the time to get this right and expand this kind of mobile-led engagement.”
For now, this is something that the small businesses already offer, but the bigger business companies will also get access to this as well as the other capabilities.
One advantage to this system is that the larger businesses can more easily interact with businesses, since they’ll be less annoyed by the fact that they can't see how many people are online to make a purchase in the first place.
Mobile applications, of course, also come with a lot of sensors, so businesses can try out different ways of how they can offer a smoother shopping experience, and even see if users can actually click through and buy, and then get better insight into how well it works.
Nokia and Microsoft have a longstanding relationship in their mobile efforts. This is the second time that Nokia has been building and developing a service that uses Cortana, its digital personal assistant, to help customers interact with businesses through its Windows Phone platform.
This latest move is another way for Nokia to build up its mobile business.
“We started using Azure where we had a lot of investment and work, but we are seeing so much great adoption in cloud services because of Cortana,” said Niklas Savander, GM of Nokia’s I&T Centre, in a statement. “Today we are delighted to have Azure ready to go for real businesses and customers will be able to see this is the case with different usage patterns.”
This latest move is another boost for Nokia’s mobile phone platform, but one that is a big challenge to Android makers as well."
"Hook, a U.S. startup focused on reinventing the mobile payment and network for small merchants, is today announcing that it has raised $600,000 in a Series A round of funding, led by new investor Foundation Capital, and includes participation from prior backers Scale Venture Partners and former eBay executives and other angels.
Founded by Zvni Shabtai, Sami Tzal, and Nihal Mehta – a team of former PayPal employees – Hook was born out of the frustrations they faced when the company spent several months in stealth mode because of a lack of good payment processor in the market. That’s when the idea for Hook was first conceived.
At the same time, the team has faced a growing number of customers who use mobile payments for everything from mobile call centers and other business and service providers to consumers on a daily basis.
“Our growth coincided with the explosion of mobile payments, especially in emerging markets,” explains Mehta. “People started asking us why we were doing this – from the first customers and then later, a lot of inquiries internally,” he says. “When I looked into it, it was the most obvious, and they were looking for a system that would allow people to

 to (as of last month) still have a pretty limited business model on the ground. That’s something that will keep their existing services running on the ground.
The plan is to monetize via premium services starting with an Android version that gets premium pricing later on.
In the meantime, O’Connor says they’re looking to add mobile back-ups and support those who want their own backup.

"Banksy may be the future of dog walking, but these robots are still somewhat niche. After all, while there are numerous indoor pet walking programs at big box pet stores, Walkfyre is unique with a fully 3D-printed human body that can be put to work in a similar manner.
The company behind Walkfyre is a San Francisco-based startup that has raised $2.25 million in venture funding to expand its robotic pets for people’s needs. The company, which has raised $17.25 million to date, came out of Y Combinator’s newest class and is looking to pick up where it began.
If you live in an apartment or house that you rent for some reason, you need something like Walkfyre, so be sure to check out their website here, or they just sent a request to the company office. As it’s a $2 billion market for pet walking, the program is pretty darn good and Walkfyre could just go big with the business.
Here’s the website on Walkfyre, explaining the technology and the new funding:"
"Google’s new Google Maps Android application has a pretty unique feature called “Shows” which lets you keep track of your friends’ whereabouts in your immediate vicinity, without even having to turn on a smartphone. Users can keep track of their friends by having their phone set as their primary camera and they can share their location through video chat. Plus, no one can spot you in virtual rooms – after all, Google needs your friends to use its services without you asking.
The feature, called “Shows,” comes with the help of a smart lighting feature, to help you prepare for the cold weather outside.
The idea here is for two-person friends – including both your co-workers and your kids – to keep their cell phones in their hands and get out of the house a bit. With your phone, they can stay at their shared spot where you can enjoy the shows they’re up to.
The product, Walkfyre, is designed for people, not just cute dogs or robots, but for people, and specifically those who don’t want to be tied down to their regular jobs. In fact, Walkfyre founder Danny Chuda is trying to get his friend to join a robot club, where he wants to keep it in the house so they can watch TV while he drives. Of course, the shuns, no matter how silly they sound when they’re uttered, have to be tied to their actual duties.
The show itself is not yet live on YouTube, but a Google account will give you a better feel for what it’s worth.
The company says Walkfyre is only rolling out to its website’s to more users than usual, and the feature will continue on for a few weeks. After that, the company will turn on its advertising services.
“We think you’ll be able to leverage our smart advertising platform to reach more users on Android with this app,” Google Mobile CEO Sankar Bani, who was previously the head of Google’s ad-buying team, noted.
The feature would make sense for Google, which already manages location for Android handsets which require users to turn their phone on and off, which in turn requires others to have cell data enabled and therefore using the same service. That is, in order to be able to sell ads to users, Google needs the technology to be able to match the timing of when their cell phone is most likely to be getting close to them.
In that sense, if the company wants to reach its advertising-fueled customers, it needs you to bring your phone closer to them. Otherwise, the results could be disappointing.

Currently, Walkfyre comes with a 1.3-mile radius of its users, giving it a nice buffer between locations and those where users are parked.
There are only five shows this week, so it’s still growing, Chuda told us in an interview, but the company is looking to reach at least 700 shows in the next year.
The feature is only available in a limited beta for now to test the feature. More importantly, Chuda emphasizes, will never get a user’s address book to sell on the platform, he says, but the company will

�s business or service team to get better answers because they are just trying to get the answer from what’s happening when you ask for it.
But this is where things get messy. You have the right people from on-demand answering the right questions, but a lot are often ‘out of place’ depending on you. It’s a complex issue. If all of your team members got fed up as they asked multiple times to do a series of different things that had no connection, there is no guarantee of at least giving ‘a peek’ by the end of the trip."
"If you weren’t convinced that the era of on-demand food delivery is already over, think of Postmates as a new kind of Uber: it’s a way to order food that’s already been made and delivered, and it’s already in your city.
And it’s growing like crazy. Postmates, which now has 3 million active users in its service based out of San Francisco’s SOMA neighborhood, recently opened its service in new areas: New York, Chicago, L.A. and San Jose. Its delivery times are nearly identical to those of Uber, with Postmates drivers and riders able to complete the service quicker than if Postmates were to provide pre-scheduled deliveries and push them as a push-not-pull feature.

In the five years that have passed, Postmates has raised over $90 million, including a $51 million round in September of last year just two days before Postmates announced a $60 million round. In fact, that $45 million round was led by Fidelity Ventures, and valued the company at $182 million after filing’s S-1.
Postmates is always looking to grow its business. The company previously told us that it was worth $30 billion, and is now valued at $75 billion. This latest round is just the latest round in that growing round, and the round was led by a single investor.
“Postmates is a brand new company, and it’s the natural extension of the company,” said Jeff Post, co-founder and CEO of Postmates. “But we still believe in the power of simplicity. You can do whatever you want to do with Postmates, in fact. So it was pushing the envelope of what we wanted to do, and we’ve just done it, and we think it makes a great fit.”
When the service launched last year, Postmates was launching in New York, San Francisco and New York, New Jersey, Chicago, D.C. and Washington, D.C. Postmates launched at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2014, and the company has now expanded to cover nearly 20 U.S. cities.
“We want to be the Uber for grocery delivery,” Post added. “We’re going to go where we are, when we’re doing it for other places.
The company launched in April 2015, and has been running in eight cities for the past year, since it began picking up drivers. In addition to providing food and beverage delivery, Postmates also provides on-demand deliveries for other businesses like consulting, cleaning and pet‎.

 
Postmates recently launched Postmates on Instagram, but it was only in July that the service bounced at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2014 with two new services: Postmates Now, a curated daily delivery service, and Postmates Rewards, Postmates’ first ever loyalty program in order for retailers. The former is $9.99 per month, and a $4.99 credit.
Postmates has also added other perks, like discounts, promotions and deals. Postmates is also one of the first major transportation companies to offer Uber for drivers to make a few trips per week.
Meanwhile, a user experience tool will let Postmates users tap on and hold to buy products from different retailers to get them delivered to their homes and office.
Postmates, which launched this week and currently has 9 million downloads across iOS and Android, plans to add payments to its app in the next few months.
The company is looking at a number of ways to expand the Postmates mobile experience, which already includes a simple tipping option to let users pay for items at a time instead of using checks as they would while driving around the city.
For example, if you’re near a store like Zappos and want to shop for clothing, post to Postmates in the app and ask for it to be delivered in the Postmates car to be picked up. As they would if they have a wallet, Postmates can use the information

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Twitter’s been in a bit of trouble of itself lately — with questions about its growth slowly getting more questions about what does, and no clear signs that it is slowing down monetization shifts and how it will continue to grow as things get started; and with no indications that it’s putting those same issues behind the company’s newer plays. In that sense, today’s acquisition of Twitter for $1.56 billion feels like that: the acquisition would have been a mark of Twitter’s new direction, with the team that has been at Twitter for more than a decade now working on its mobile products for users, and its earlier product, and then, as CEO Jack Dorsey called it, its “biggest acquisition in history.”
However, in the case of Twitter, it’s not just an app that has always been a big focus for Twitter as a company (to get a taste of all its products, one after the other?), but for a product as complex as messaging — and that may have been it at one time, before becoming, as you remember, the one that helped to change the way people interact with a service.
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey noted during his keynote today, in San Francisco, today: “Today, we’re getting to the stage where this is our most exciting moment to date. The #connectivity revolution is coming to a close today and this is an exciting announcement for all of you. We’ve shared our vision for a messaging service for more than a decade in our keynote today. Today marks an amazing day for our partners — more than 40 million people connect with Twitter every month. Twitter continues to power a growing, global communications world.”
The service, which has a lot of room for innovation today and is one that Twitter has been building and growing with, continues to have a focus on messaging. Today, it has become the service for consumers to get quick and simple answers to their questions on mobile devices. It offers users access to things like status updates from a person or company, or people who may be tweeting as well; and it also offers other features that involve things like geofencing, for instance. Twitter says that it will integrate these features into “the company’s broader suite of advertising products.” The company is making other updates to the messaging product as part of this growth, too. (The company just announced updates to its ads.)
“People are expecting a great, simple, clean and fast Twitter experience on their mobile devices,” Dorsey added in a statement on the phone. “We’re super excited to welcome our community to engage with and use our products more seamlessly. The team at Twiti will be a terrific addition to our team, and we’re delighted to have them join the team at Twilio.”
Twitter, of course, also faces new competitors like Facebook, which recently bought Oculus for $2 billion (although what you’ll see a bit more of is not just the company’s products in-house, but also the ones it’s developing and working with, like Microsoft and Dropbox, among others. There is, on the other hand, things like Facebook’s acquisition of WhatsApp, which also may have a knock-on effect for the company as a messaging service.
That being said, all the questions have been answered previously around how Twitter would work with and monetize its messaging service. It’s been something that was never really considered to be a “tech” play, but the company has been talking for some time. “It is difficult, I would argue, to build a messaging product that is simple enough, that not just is great for a certain type of user,” Doshi noted at today’s news. “We talk very carefully about this in our product development. To make sure that it’s not hard to understand and that the product is good enough, we have a pretty steep learning curve in developing the product in the UK, with us and all of us getting used to, for a long time.”
This is clearly the last big development that may be at the company for a while to come up with a “better” messaging service. In spite of having a lot of traction, Twitter is still struggling to prove to people that a service like this could be a sustainable alternative, and will probably continue to face a lot of scrutiny."
"Vine is launching its own private beta, and the results are… mixed. Turns out, maybe it’s not for you. Vine co-founder and CEO Colin Kroll found out this himself, when the social app went live last week.
This morning, however, it seems that Kroll and the rest of the team had made some changes based on user feedback. “It was a pretty frustrating experience,”

 star at New York Fashion Week, and then, after returning to New York to do business as a co-founder, returned home to build a new startup.
To fund the product and service development of Lulu, Lulu and the brand Lippette, Lulu has raised approximately $1 million in funding from angels including Chris Dixon (Founder and CEO of ZeroC), Joe Lonsdale, Jay Wilder (CEO of Wildfire), Russ Fradin (CEO of Locu) and Chris Dixon (President of Zillow), who met during TechCrunch Disrupt.
According to CrunchBase Lulu also has several VC partners who are among the early investors in its portfolio, which also includes Maverick Venture Partners, SV Angel, David Cohen, Joseph Poon, Josh Kopelman, Alex Rosenfeld (co-founder of Rocket), and Eric Draper (co-founder of Draper Fisher Jurvetson).
A key part of Lulu’s fundraising comes from AngelList – a company that organizes investors and angels to connect with companies in the tech world as an alternate meet.
“Lulu gives AngelList its own meet for entrepreneurs – a place where its members can meet and network,” said Lulu CEO Lira Olovov. “There was an explosion of interest. [The site grew and then crashed in December, causing members to abandon what they were doing,] and we realized this wasn’t just something that we need to do better. We have members now using it to meet entrepreneurs as well.”
The company will continue building out its own network, including members and mentors from startups and beyond. Olovov says Lulu is helping companies with “innovation, branding, sales, support, and strategy.”
Some companies are using Lulu to meet people outside their own company, while others are using it to connect with potential mentors based in Lulu locations. Lulu offers a tool for hosting, sharing content and content creation on its network, offering some premium membership tiers for companies and individual members, including a number of pre-paid offers. Lulu also provides other services like a marketing platform for organizations as well as a way to keep the connections with the locals.
The company says several hundred startups are currently listed in its marketplace, representing “hundreds of thousands of new, young companies” in fields like financial, social and marketing, and it believes there are also at least some potential expansion locations.
However, most of Lulu’s members use the service to connect with mentors who are offering job skills that help these companies develop in other fields as well, Olovov notes.
“They come from anywhere,” notes Olovov of Lulu’s network. “So, many come from the city, but there are also people who are out on the East Coast as well who use.”
Lulu’s current list of members includes some notable members:
The company declined to share its membership numbers except to say that it has an extensive service network, and that it was adding more companies each year.
“Lulu has become an alternative channel of communication for our audience,” Olovov says.
“We feel like that’s where it should head,” Olovov adds. “If you are a company that is growing and you want a new investor on board of your company, then having a relationship with someone who is involved with growth stages of companies as a person who has been through this is important,” he continued.
While Lulu had been known as a place where people could find other entrepreneurs, now, according to the company, that list is getting much larger, with new membership from notable names like Pinterest, Spotify, Twitter and Zendesk.
The next goal for Lulu is to continue operating as a community for local talent who are looking to share ideas and learn each other. The first step in this new direction is to launch workshops and events where the company is looking to mentor founders on the hardcore startup topics that they face – like design. (Lulu is also looking to help startups and larger companies launch and scale.)
The second goal is to grow Lulu’s business by working more closely with local companies.
“It’s important to support local entrepreneurs,” said Olovov. “A lot of entrepreneurs are facing issues that they don’t have a lot of time to deal with and local. That’s the reason Lulu is here, to help them understand how to build great companies.”"
"Foursquare, a company that has been working to help users more regularly check in on events and activities, has started offering events an

"Forrester Research has published a fascinating report on European startups, with a particularly strong focus on the so-called unicorn club — in Europe or, more accurately, not in Europe — and the growth and successes of the past 100 startups that have appeared in this section.
Forrester’s report covers about 1,000 entrepreneurs that are all from EU “core” tech companies and those based in Belgium, Spain and France. Forrester estimates there are 2.8 million European “startups” in the technology sector, a long-term trend that will only increase as Europeans “fiercely seek new opportunities,” as I have already argued for Forrester. As a result, the report tracks more than one billion employees and 100,000 startups.
On the “unicorn” category, Forrester is using statistics about private sales on the Internet to estimate growth potential and, to a lesser extent, “European business investment standards.” I’ll go a bit deeper in this, but the key point here is that although Europe has lots of good companies, if you’re at all interested in startups then investing in a better solution to the problem of talent and capital is a very strong cause.
In all, the report shows that this past decade saw more European companies venture into the technology sector, with more than a third of all employees now working in tech. Forrester believes that “in the next decade European businesses will be all over again.” To wit:
The report also breaks out how each one in 10 European startups have gone on to raise a further round of financing. While, admittedly, these numbers may not be newsworthy to a small business owner like me, Forrester notes that the European technology industry has “high capital requirements and deep competition on the markets.” So you’re more than a billion dollars better to invest in those startups than the ones that are only raising a fraction of that on seed rounds.

While the European tech industry isn’t in full “health and care” shape, there are still more VCs for exits within the industry than in the same industry in the U.S., “and the private market is expanding its funding opportunities.”
There is still a lot of room for growth in Europe, however, with Forrester noting that there is some real appetite (pardon the pun) for “technology as a service” companies that can add value to a company’s existing customers.
We’ll keep listening until I get some more context on the next report.
For reels of stories about what European governments mean when talking about funding opportunities, it’s easy to see why they’re often very interested in them. Of the 800 billion dollars invested and a little over $1 trillion in Europe, over $600 billion are invested at the seed stage, almost all at the seed stage. European funding is also in a growth phase, which means there is a high rate of exit, “especially in the financial services space.”
This is for Europe to continue to do some of its heavy lifting, with an increasing focus on fintech, the European tech industry, and startups. For instance, Forrester is also looking for “European business angels with strong connections across Europe,” but in the long run this could become a more attractive offer.
This is the third annual report Forrester has published this month, and it is the fourth in the series."
"Today Microsoft unveiled its latest quarterly earnings results under the heading U.S.-only rubric: Redmond’s earnings under GAAP was $4.3 billion, higher year on year versus $3.9 billion in Q2 2011, and $4.4 billion compared to $3.8 billion during the same quarter in 2012. Microsoft’s GAAP net loss for 2013 was $4.3 billion versus $5.8 billion for 2013. Operating income was 1.4 billion compared with $16 million in 2013.
But the U.S. beat even more: its GAAP adjusted fiscal income for 2013 rose 4 percent, to $5.5 billion. The company’s GAAP operating margin is down 3 percent in 2013 versus 3.5 percent in 2013, it has a current operating debt per share of negative $1.1 billion.
While Microsoft reported GAAP operating margin of $12 billion, that was a 4.7 percent decline on previous quarters.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Japan is now a major player as the country was in the middle of its recession in the first half of 2010, which meant they found themselves unable to compete efficiently with their US counterparts. There is also the existing competitive landscape that is now being challenged by newcomers like China, with the increasing awareness among consumers of better living conditions in the country thanks to the launch of Xiaomi’s smartphone.
So Xiaomi now competes not just in the smartphone space, but in the smart home market – something that Apple might claim is a bit of a given given given given given given Apple’s position. Apple may be looking for an upgrade from Android to iOS, which could in turn have an adverse effect on sales of its new products, but it’s probably a case of wait and see how they play out in an upcoming new era of competition."
"A team of hackers is building an open source surveillance vehicle that can hide behind cover stores to collect huge amounts of data. They call it a smart shop that runs autonomously and can sell license to the customers that open them up. They called it a joint investigation, but it’s not a vehicle so much as it is a mobile store for collecting data that can gather customer names without a warrant. The team, Peter Guemondi and Paul Cramer found what they found so interesting:
They’ve now sold the device to the customers that they installed it in the door. They’ve installed it in a well-designed restaurant, a brick building in a nice part of town in the Bay Area in the south of San Francisco. The company then allows them to go from a standard store and start a sort of guerrilla warfare against the local police forces to keep a watch on their customers.
“We have no plans to buy back this data. We won’t give it to anybody,” said Cramer. “We’re not selling this and we don’t know where we will store it. This is a very complicated situation, but we think we made the right decision.”

It’s one of the most hacker-friendly of all the things out there.
“I think anyone with a plan could potentially come into this and not get killed”, said Cramer. “If we have a plan that is really bad we will go and do that, but if is more like that we’ll keep it for the purpose of protecting people.”
The plan is to have a team of security contractors monitoring the doors and collecting data and then reporting back to the company to tell them to stop or else. One of the advantages of using a garage door like this is that you actually have to put all of those bricks down, to ensure that no one gets in.
The idea was that the team was able to learn a lot about the people they are putting numbers to, to inform them about different types of people, whether they be juveniles, new arrivals, people getting in under a certain age, and so on.
“We learned about the way people are using different devices and we built a big profile for each person that we are monitoring, to be able to figure out these are people who are probably here for fun, or people just getting out, like for purpose, or to get to know each other.”
Guemondi said that when they met the co-founder, a lot of the ideas they thought of would be totally impossible using conventional locks and instead wanted to tie down different types of lock systems together with a small mobile unit. They built the system with the help of the 3D-printing Silicone.
“We actually built our own sensors which is pretty interesting and unique,” said Cramer. “We decided to build this in our garage, out of the workshop, out of the box.”
The team is based in New York but works out of Portland, Oregon.
“This is not a lock that will just open but will open on it. It has multiple senses,” said Cramer. “If it’s really just for purpose we wanted to make sure it could feel safe. This also protects people from the possibility of getting found out.”
They plan to offer this up for sale in stores starting next month."
"Google is the big search company in Europe, while at the same time it’s trying to acquire competitors — which in turn have the potential to reshape a market in which Google — and now the UK government, have been waging a war against the old-guard incumbents. Now another European player has entered the ring — launching a new, very ‘startup-like’, search engine, which is aimed at European ecommerce sites, with a similar layout to those of Google’s European rival, Groupon.

, how to handle social media, the business's website/website, their location, what they want to do, what they want to accomplish, and more. This would give an easy way to monitor what users have seen, clicked on, and the like, without having to constantly switch between apps. An average of 100,000 sites are already using the service, and you can see the full spectrum of their content here.
The site is free, and as a result, the company wants to be a true market leader — it can say “no” to social media management. In other words, yes it might start seeing revenue in the future — there’s no denying that. However, Foursquare has its challenges ahead of it, so the company has to demonstrate that it can help business leaders figure out how to improve business and grow it as well.
It’s a complex space to dive in and make a difference in a business, and Foursquare is a great example of how a solid business leader can turn a lot of attention into something they could be proud of.
The company says its new funding will help it hire engineers to help it make its new products better. The company also plans to develop new mobile apps and platforms in the near future to help it better bridge the Foursquare user community with businesses that want to connect."
"The growth of mobile devices and the explosion of smartphones that have come since have made it increasingly difficult for older people to remain in touch with friends through regular phone calls and texts. But they are beginning to have an impact on the world of the elderly. For a young woman in a rural village in rural West Africa, it can mean difficult times, especially with her.
Nigeria has been trying to get more smartphones onto its streets for the past few years, with mixed success. But it looks like it has the potential to take a different approach. It has begun marketing to get smartphones made for the elderly for the first time.
A Nigerian nurse, who I spoke to earlier this week, showed me how to make a phone call, but it turns out that these new devices were made specifically for this purpose, not an earlier market as a safety precaution. After being on the site, she could call back with real time information from the local helpline, mobile site, email and phone numbers, and she would get a dispatcher. She could talk to someone in a different city or on the train by phone, or text with one of the local doctors, but all the medical support and social services that she could choose to receive from an advisor or nurse to try to get the situation stabilized.
The nurse had the phone number and dialed from her phone to her local physician, who is now on the site. She would get updates from the doctor and get free calls from local specialists, who can come in whenever they’re needed. The site allows both experts and locals to chat and back up with each other. It’s designed to do both a city-wide and nationwide service, but the nurse could have a regular back up of nurses and specialists in specific hospitals.

It’s not the world’s first attempt at this outreach. In 2013 in Nigeria, I covered a mobile-phone-based elderly outreach program run by another nurse which used a smartphone app to dial in old people who live in their town. While you can see how this could be done on a mobile phone, it still shows a problem and can potentially have an impact in the same way. An alternative would be to use a telephony box, but with the increased awareness, it could become an entirely different solution to this situation – and this is the kind of thing that could have a big impact.
Now Nigeria is apparently able to promote the program by placing calls to a regular doctor.
Here’s a sample of the campaign in Nigeria, and on a wider scale, which the nurse says has been “very well”:
Here’s the nurse’s own Facebook post from that program, in which she describes the response. She adds that she found that some 90 percent of the patients actually kept on talking even after a crisis.
Nigeria is a small developing country in Western Africa with a population of about 60 million, and if it can get this program up and running, it could eventually earn upwards of $10 million globally.
While it’s hard to put a value on the value of this initiative, the concept of getting mobile assistance for elderly people is already growing among developers and app developers. But it could still potentially provide a better customer experience than mobile apps and services like Skype or SMS."
"For more than a decade, the web was known as a revolution for spreading information. Everything was suddenly accessible, as pages of websites would be available at any time. Sites were built with a specific URL linked to another site. For example, the site was

” says Martin. “Now, it’s not about this new device being the right kind of device at the right time for the right occasion. It’s really about the right technology being used for the right purpose. We’ve had great success in this, and we are working with our partners.”
As to which OEMs were making which phones at the moment? “Samsung is the lead, Motorola is also leading the pack, but we’ve seen others in the mix,” says Martin.
Martin adds that he’s still excited about the possibilities of a future where you could pick up the phone after you land your flight with your iPhone and use a voice-controlled car.
In terms of funding, he says the team has raised over $130,000, with a small portion of that being a private family round.

"If you’re looking for a new Android device and you aren’t satisfied with what Motorola has to offer, look to Xiaomi’s new Mi 5s. The Chinese electronics maker has just released an update to its own Mi 5s and introduced a new variant as well. In addition to a front camera, the handset boasts a new fingerprint scanner, a larger battery and a new rear-facing camera that uses information it has gleaned from its sensors to identify human gesture.
But perhaps more exciting is the fact that Xiaomi’s fingerprint scanner could also identify you based on the software on the device. If the device senses that you have a good number, it will ask you to allow access to your phone number. By default it will only let you control the touchscreen — you don’t have to turn it off or on. It also gives you a second chance to try the device, since it probably won’t be stuck on the home screen like on other Mi family handsets.
Another big plus for Xiaomi is the addition of a new app. There are two versions, one for phones and one for tablets. The company has partnered with the Chinese tech house Intelligent to power this new Android variant, and it has taken advantage of the deep integration that Lenovo has between ARM and X. With this update, Xiaomi is letting developers install its custom skins — in addition to the regular Android update.
The device is designed to let you do things like change your wallpaper by turning your screen black to get more comfortable. It also lets you browse the web with the browser fully open while in the phone’s screen. The user can also customize the look and feel of the product in a brand new setting by painting one picture on top of another and then uploading it to other social networks for users to use.
As Xiaomi’s own Mi 5s is targeted at Asia’s mass market, it can use the new funding to expand the reach of its devices in the U.S.
You can pre-order the new version of Xiaomi’s flagship Mi smartphone in the U.S. for $99.
Android smartphone makers can’t rest easy since China is one of the most active Android markets, and the company is going to have to contend with strong competition from new Chinese Android giants such as Samsung and Apple for the next generation of phone hardware.
For now, Xiaomi is not officially revealing its newest flagship phones. This year, Xiaomi promised a flagship product in Q2. While the company isn’t yet making a huge splash in the world of the world, a device launched by a direct competitor of Huawei which also launched a similar device, the Huawei P2s."
"Samsung could buy a European competitor to Motorola’s Android device business for $3.2 billion if it so chooses, according to a new report from Reuters.
The firm may own Android devices in the EU as MotoG, as the report claims it’s looking to buy Motorola and Motorola for $4.2 billion. A source with knowledge of the matter confirmed negotiations are underway now between Samsung and Apple to buy Google-based MotoG. Other companies like Nokia and BlackBerry don’t currently have a presence in Europe.
Apple has an $8 billion subsidicomposition in Europe with $2.5 billion of that, $1.2 billion from it last year and $500 million this year. Motorola is $17 billion with $4.5 billion of it last year and $200 million this year. The company is expected to report a loss of about $3.9 billion in fiscal 2014 with $1.6 billion of it, $1.2 billion for fiscal 2013 and $14 billion for fiscal 2014.
Samsung is one of the biggest Android makers with a market share of 45% globally. Motorola’s market share is about a third higher than that.
The report also says Samsung’s efforts are focused on launching

 ensure a more streamlined version of the existing product.)
Here’s one particular thing that I doubt that there’s any real need to change about how Soundcloud works — and, indeed, where it differs (to a large extent) from other streaming services like Spotify — is that it lets users upload and share music from their phone, rather than just uploading to a service like Facebook through its main service. That leads to a much wider range of use-case breakdown, and can potentially lead to a lot more monetization opportunities as users keep using the app for free tracks alone, and then decide to pay for more stuff.
“We see a lot of use cases for these products,” Krzychowski notes. “There are things that we’re working on that are directly applicable to the kind of user that we want to have. For example, we have more artists and certain types of music. We also have some things that we don’t have the same way of building up our user base, with advertising for tracks where we have less users… But we’re also not focused on monetization at the moment.”
What does that mean for existing users?
“As for existing users, what they’re doing is what they were doing before,” Krzychowski says. “They’re using music everyday — for free.”
He says that the new Soundcloud will be adding “a lot of new features” — a more personalized feed of music, in his words; more ways to browse and discover; a redesign of the app for emerging countries; and new ways for people to remix and create music in private groups, all areas that previously may have been covered by competitors like Turntable.fm.
SoundCloud is still not the service for the arts, music and other creative types, but the more active users are taking advantage of a more versatile, better performing business model where ads don’t drive music on the platform but are allowed to sit alongside content that they can make money from to generate revenue. This is something that an established music business like Spotify is already doing very well, with ad-free streams of new releases on its platform.
In some respects, the advantage of the way SoundCloud is tackling this music part of the equation, Krzychowski says, will be its ability to scale the platform.
“We’re gonna continue to do this. And I think about this not being the end of it,” says Krzychowski. “It’s not the end of SoundCloud,” he notes with a laugh. “The fact is that we just turned all of the lights on,” he says. “We’re gonna continue to see more of these new features.”
That is not to say that SoundCloud’s expansion into ad-free will be entirely smooth sailing for the coming years.
“As of today all of our users are free,” Krzychowski adds, “We could potentially do a lot more in the years to come where it’s getting more intense.”
He says that SoundCloud remains profitable today — and will be continuing revenue growth. Indeed, these will be very important metrics ahead for SoundCloud on the earnings call and any other future numbers.
The company hasn’t broken out any numbers in any detail on whether people are using the service for free, “which we are and we do not make money,” Krzychowski adds."
"A day after Amazon announced that it now sees more than $1 billion in sales each day across 13 countries, another big household has signed up – namely a new owner of an iconic London landmark, St George‘s Paddick station. Amazon has given the green light to St George’s (in the words of Amazon rep Tony Hailem, this is “a great London success story”), a move that sees Amazon moving into the entire south-west of London station by the end of the summer (when the station was opened).
The new owner of the landmark, the London and Imperial College (IBC) will now be able to use St George’s station across the road, rather than the next door around the street, as it is today. The change was the result of the design and existing infrastructure work the IBC had been undertaking over the past five years, which includes a new rail crossing and improvements to the existing Baker Street roundabout park. The new site layout and redevelopment in September will see the whole area of St James’s Run transformed, and as the new owners

 for a while. He said that because it’s a more scalable business, the company can use the funds to “develop the pipeline and reorganize the organization on a company level.”
He added that the funding will allow the company to expand its operations, and also to add more engineers and data science specialists to the company — which, in turn, may help it to better compete with other enterprise mobility management companies, like MobileIron (which raised $9.5 million just last year), Boxee (which was backed by Andreessen Horowitz) and SmartRx (formerly known as Gartner). “We are really looking to move into software as a service, and scale and get even better at mobile,” he said.
Roh said that by making its data sets more accessible, MobileIron should also be able to help companies prioritize and mitigate risks.
MobileIron, which was founded four years ago, now has more than 10,000 customers, including Verizon (which owns TechCrunch), Microsoft and HP."
"Facebook’s ad network is growing faster than ever before, according to the network’s VP of global sales, Ben Medlock.
More than 1 billion videos are watched on the network every month, he said. So Facebook can push that to more ads — the easier it is to do online, because there’s no bandwidth overhead. But, he argued, “We can’t grow faster with fewer people on the page because people are watching more video on the web.
If you can increase the amount of viewable content on the network, that can lead to higher engagement — there’s a business cycle there. That’s the argument being made by some advertisers, to the extent that ad blockers are included in the content recommendation, as is often the case with Internet video and gaming sites. But Medlock, who remains in the company’s office and oversees the ads division within Facebook’s ad platform, disagrees with that and also reiterated again during the company’s earnings call this month, that YouTube is still the most-viewed website on the Internet.
“We continue to see YouTube is where we first start to see a tremendous amount of traffic,” he said. “The traffic that we see in YouTube is much greater than other content on other platforms, even if some platform is not the largest. There are more video views per user than YouTube does.”
More importantly, Medlock continued, Facebook has “doubled down on video” recently, making the amount of time viewers watch video three times more in the United States. As YouTube does, they have a growing appetite to consume that video content, and it’s not just being made for social consumption.
On the side of Facebook rival Apple, Medlock had this to say about how Facebook stacks up against Cupertino at least in terms of video: “They’re doing a heck of a job on mobile. It’s so much better on iOS … The only thing that has made iTunes worth is premium video.”
But the CEO also spoke on the value of YouTube in terms of the way it presents and becomes a marketing vehicle for content on the network. (And the way Facebook is developing its advertising tools and working with top brands on native ads in the News Feed, the first of a new set of ad formats.)
“A lot of people used to think that [YouTube] was some other thing that existed on YouTube. There were some 360-degree videos, there was some on the YouTube website. They just kind of moved beyond that,” he said. “The number of 360 content is hundreds of thousands of thousands of videos.”
The discussion was brought up by more recent comments in which YouTube founder Chubba Gurabhattdi, who oversees YouTube’s content and ads, wrote that Vine and other short-form video clips have become mainstream media properties. The idea, Gurumabhattdi said, is to make these videos more accessible for users, and to better monetize them.  Since Vine was launched two years ago, he said, it has become the sixth-largest creative platform in the world, with more than 12 million followers. Gurabhattdi said that’s well within reach for both new and existing users.
And the short-form content isn’t just something that YouTube is doing as a service, but as a utility, too. You already know that YouTube has a lot of 360 content — for example, at the time when YouTube launched its original 360 “Flipagram” tool, the company said it had 500,000 360 videos on YouTube, and the average video time per viewer was 45 seconds. 
In a conversation this morning, Gurupabhattdi said that his team has worked hard on

 unlip is about to be born! The company plans to raise around $450,000 with its Kickstarter campaign, and if enough people vote to fund it, that money should be collected and then turned into a general merchandise release later down the road.
What is the process with manufacturing these shirts and other products of the apparel? The team, which currently resides in Taiwan, has created a single line of shirts, called Nui, running the Geeks on a Plane production process. These shirts were created in batches, using a combination of components, including silicone, fiberglass and other topcoats.
“The main idea for Nui is not to try to create cheap-y products using their existing materials; instead, we are trying to create products that have all the components for mass manufacturing to a very high level of quality,” says Ko.
The initial line is made from Geeks on a Plane’s materials, with the Nui line continuing on at a rapid rate. After the shirt (pictured above) is built and the design changes, the company presses out second batch “very fast,” he says. The initial line is sold as 5,000, but Nui is working to scale up its manufacturing schedule and run a new Kickstarter campaign later this month to fund the next phase of production.
In the past, Nui produced things like promotional and discount codes.

“When we started our campaign for Geeks on a Plane, we had planned to build the first production run from scratch. This ended up not having that plan,” José’s pushing notes.
Indeed, some of Nui’s team moved out of New York’s Flatiron district when Nui came through to stay with the group for an extended period of time.
But things have changed, as the company announced today that it plans to expand its team of under 3 employees, most of whom work from Geeks on a Plane.
The new products will be made at the same factory and the same location but the team is planning other locations for the shirts, accessories and other supplies, José adds. So far, Nui has shipped to 17 countries, including Japan, Indonesia, the US, Singapore, Hong and Korea.
This round of funding is the first time the company has raised money on this current funding cycle — last March, the founders only raised $1.6 million from investors like Founder Collective, 500 Startups, and angels such as Jason Calacanis and SV Angel; in April, they raised another million from investors including Ron Conway, SV Angel, Lerer Ventures, Felicis Ventures, Lerer Ventures, and AngelList, among others.
There are a number of places where products can be sourced and manufactured in Asia. The startup has hundreds of people from Korea, Japan, China, Singapore and Vietnam who work in places like Samsung, Panasonic and Apple. Nui is now on track to manufacture goods for more than 100 countries.
José and his team believe they are delivering products at cheaper prices than their other competitors in the high-end apparel space. “This gives us a huge advantage as we start manufacturing from large manufacturers overseas,” he said of the team’s future plans.
Nui isn’t alone in the apparel and accessories space. In addition to Geeks on a Plane, another major competitor in this space is Lamoda which is backed by Rocket Internet."
"A year and a half ago, Y Combinator-backed Zap Zap Fractionsheet was a project created by ex-Googlers to solve the problem of finding a service in which they could all make their own jobs. Today, the problem has shifted to tackling the whole automation issue with automation services such as Xero, a Palo Alto-based company for companies and individuals to offer services of services.
In the middle of the last decade, the Internet of Things referred to its ability to be embedded directly in devices. But that wasn’t quite so easy. First, sensors had to work to power the Internet, and then as they became smart enough to work directly by the devices they were collecting data from, we’ve also shifted the roles of people and machines. These now include things both self-built artificial intelligence with autopilot capabilities, and machine software-defined systems, often run of crowdsourced intelligence.
So while AI, machine learning and crowdsourcing are all taking off, both are part of a broader, but perhaps far more complex shift in how people are working, and what new employment is being created for the elabor surged

 are coming at its door.
It’s not uncommon for popular apps on the App Store to launch with one-third of new users during their initial launch week, which is how the app grew out in the App Store and what it then needs to gain new users (and keep them). But this new wave has arrived in a different app, and now is mobile and living in its mobile first moments.
That’s all the more impressive considering it launched on launch day for a brand new marketplace, App Store. It’s a more surprising turn of events for an App Store market that had been relatively dormant, since recent data from analytics firms shows that in the new app’s debut, it was the biggest market for new releases to surface.
And as the mobile app market matures, it will see this type of new app life or perish before others even know. (See picture of the App Store.)
The App Store’s top chart is dominated by other top-grossing apps which are less likely to be quickly gobbled up by the big-name developers and platforms like Facebook who are looking to cash in on capturing the app ecosystem. But the App Store still doesn’t completely rule out the possibility that more mainstream apps like Snapchat could be snapped up by the big guys too.
All the same, it’s a much more important new market to focus on."
"As we approach peak computing with the launch of Windows 10, the technology that runs on servers and on the web will have to mature faster to keep pace with new features. So today, Microsoft is rolling out a new set of features for Office 365 — which the company already offers, but usually in bundled with cloud-based software instead.
The new features are essentially a straightforward extension of the Microsoft Platform licensing system Microsoft launched for existing Office 365 customers over the summer. As Microsoft’s Stephen Elop said when Microsoft announced the move, “We’re moving to the cloud and we don’t have to hold on to anything.”
The Office 365 subscription service launches today at noon Eastern time, and TechCrunch readers can grab it in its entirety for the low price of $99 per month.

How does the new version work? Basically, Microsoft’s cloud-based platform for Office 365 gives customers a more unified application structure for their work. That could mean that Microsoft’s Office 365 will now include a lot more features and functionality than what the previous version of Office 365 featured.
Because Microsoft has pushed Office 365 to become a service that runs across all kinds of devices, that means it’s coming at a time when the previous version of Windows, which was released in 2011, is seeing its usage of PCs decline significantly — but Windows still has a sizeable market share, and the service’s core business is what Microsoft has to monetize it through.
The main cloud-based apps that will be included in Windows 10 are Outlook, Outlook 2016 and Word. Outlook is a core component and Microsoft has worked hard to get it to be on par with other popular mobile apps such as Instagram and Slack, so there will be Outlook integration, as well as an app store and more streamlined workflow suggestions. Microsoft also has plans to add more productivity tools and more editing tools to its Word and Excel editing tools.
Word is a common argument for moving to Microsoft-owned Skype (which Microsoft owned for a year and is not moving away). But it’s clear who are looking at what users are actually using more, and that’s exactly the reason for rolling these new capabilities out now.
Microsoft declined to say what percentage of Windows users will move to new product, but its existing customers won’t be seeing those new features go away for a couple of reasons.
The first is that Microsoft has made Office 365 a free product that’s essentially the same price as a subscription to Microsoft’s productivity suite, Skype. This way, Microsoft can focus on improving the product and not the product. It’s important for Microsoft to retain its existing loyal customers, and for this launch it’s important that it continues to sell Office 365 subscriptions to existing subscribers — all of which Skype is expecting to bring in new users.
Reaching roughly the same user base with Outlook was always going to mean more than just a cheaper product. That will mean more work put into the product, and it’s important Microsoft continues to maintain a strong user base of Windows Phone 7 subscribers.
Second, there are a couple of other points. As most of these new features roll out, they’ll only succeed for a few users. So Microsoft has developed another reason — which it won’t get into writing the feature, but there’s not a hard way to predict — that a given feature may work well, but won’t make the average Microsoft employee or

 s Twitter handles as well as his Facebook accounts. 
As you go through this process, you’ll find that Facebook, as well as Google Now can serve as a way of connecting with the company’s most important new feature — Facebook Messenger. 
While this is the first time we’ve seen something like this on Facebook’s social network, the hope is that this kind of integration could also include the same kind of integration that Facebook’s mobile app and website currently have — allowing Facebook users to send notifications and messages to their friends based on contacts they have in common.
And, as it stands, most of this is only available in the U.S. But there’s plenty of opportunity for Facebook to go further. It seems the company wants to be in a conversation with WhatsApp. 
And one of our favorite services on the planet, WeChat, lets users place calls to their friends that are not within range of their official WeChat account. This way, users who aren’t in contact with that person can still see the notification. 
Facebook can do anything with Messenger, and it’s already started in its native mobile app. The company could build an app that sends texts to its Facebook Messenger channel, to their Messenger inbox. If this were Facebook’s answer to SMS then WhatsApp Messenger has potential. 
However, Facebook has already come up with how to connect a phone number with a Facebook Page, making it relatively simple to jump in (pun: “WeChat,” not “WhatsApp,”) and start chatting. 
It’s an integration that Facebook will probably be keen to get right, which is why a test on Android could be a good fit. The question: What do you get?"
"The folks at MacDot, the team in charge of the Apple Watch smartwatch, aren’t kidding around. And they’re not the only company to notice an Apple Watch interface change.
As reported by MacDot, Apple has rolled out a minor change in WatchKit/Actions, the Apple Watch Notification Center app, and the watchfaces.
The changes are as follows:
The Apple Watch app changed to view notifications on the Watch side, instead of the current side view. (This isn’t unlike what has been noticed by Twitter users as well as Google users.) The notifications now also appear on the watchfaces view to the right rather than at the bottom of the screen.
We’ve emailed Apple and Google for confirmation and will update to correct the notes if/when the update goes live, but here’s what we know:

The Apple Watch App used to have a custom Watchface, which could be customized with images or text on top of the existing text, as well as background images. The new Watch app now shows just notifications without images. We could also be looking at this change.
The Apple Watch now shows a “watchface” in addition to a “contents” view.
The Apple Watch app used to allow you to view info as well as “time of day.” This is what the current version of the Apple Watch does.
The Apple Watch app used to be a part of your watch face. These would display call and incoming phone calls and texts. When you pressed the watch face, you could see info and time, as well as the location along with basic info like where the phone is being at any given moment.
However, in a recent update, Apple moved to replace these features with the now much more subtle “contents.” This is a nice subtle change that might have not been noticed during the beta tests, since it wasn’t visible to users in a “watchface” setting. It could either have been done by Apple, or something that developers in the Apple Watch community were setting up after seeing a feature in the beta app. You’d also know that they had tried to integrate with Apple Pay earlier to use this year. (It’s no surprise that this wasn’t rolled out to all Watch users.)
We’ve written about the details of Apple Watch’s watchface before, including how it looks and functions.
This update looks to be a simple one. There, you’ll see a button for the Watch, a Watch faces menu that brings up info and time of day, a complication on your iPhone, and a “tap” button that takes you to a complication on your Apple Watch.
However, the reason all watchfaces look different, may be that some part of the UI had been updated to look more like a watchface. Apple’s product manager Michael Buckwald told me that this was done to make the Apple Watch feel more like the existing iPhone and Watch app and less like “an app that is just a

turn to the people who helped get the product off the ground, or those who helped build the concept.
“I think having a strong early line of thinking would have been pretty important to get the products out the door,” he added. “It was only now that everyone’s got a phone and a screen in their pocket. When they’re at a coffee shop, they might not have had a phone at their desk.”
In that respect, there are definite positives about the M3’s mission, although ultimately it’s also asking for users to be the ones providing the hardware. That user-centric focus has to be right from the outset, with M3’s offering a platform out of the gate that puts the app front and centre — and where’s the risk in that vision, given the need to be sure the service is reliable?
TechCrunch got hands on a limited beta of the M3, and while I’m inclined to give it the benefit of anonymity, I’m also going to hold the service accountable for anything that I’m positive about.
The app does a very well job of offering user authentication on the device, with the login process straightforward and smart, with the app learning via feedback how and when it should check in with a user. Albeit, user-friendly login is not a new idea — remembering and authenticating with an on-device screen is a well-worn trick on mobile devices, even if it remains a relatively hardcore proposition in the smartphone age.
What’s still lacking in the M3 is the aforementioned personalization, since I don’t know how Nokia plans to incorporate more personalization features into M3 as part of a service model. But perhaps the single most hard-core feature of the app is the ability to serendipitously send one-to-one mobile promotions, which is promising to be a pretty robust service in the near future — although M3 is using the clumsy codename of ‘M3 Relay’ (just so you can see it) — to help manage the service.
In other words, Nokia has opted for a pretty standard business model here — which is the app itself is free/as-you-go. Or at least, as the company calls it, you can “choose how you feel…” Here’s hoping it manages to deliver on the promise of ‘M3 Relay.’"
"There’s a new startup working on how to put solar panels into every home in America. The company, Solar Power Technologies, has raised $1.2 million in Series A funding and now plans to start putting solar panels in 100 US cities this year, according to the company. Solar Power has also acquired the team of the UK-based startup, Green World Labs. This brings the company’s total funding to $2.16 million.
With solar panels on every home in America, many people are asking why they need new energy sources when the energy they use already has been used the previous year in the United States. This can be a big question, especially on the energy side, considering just how many consumers there are, and in many cases, still relying on fossil fuels for power.
To combat this energy imbalance, Solar Power Technologies wants to put solar energy in every American home for just one night per day – which, at $40/year, would mean the equivalent to $3B/year in savings for the US system.
“Our goal for the company is to help move the US solar economy forward by 2030, using clean energy, including from wind turbines, solar panels and other clean energy systems,” said CEO and co-founder Jonathan Spitz, in a statement. “Over 80 percent of the solar energy in the US has come from wind power plants. Solar panels use 80 percent less power so we can use as little energy as we use our homes”.
The company says it intends to partner with energy markets and other clean energy providers to take advantage of this additional energy. It also claims its system can “generate billions of kWh” in savings each year.
Its system involves the development of six 5″ x “Progressive” solar panels, which come in four designs – 18x20mm x 12mm x 5mm x 3.3mm, and 2.2mm x 5mm x 5mm x 4mm) – and which can be stacked to four panels.
There are two ways to order solar power. Customers can actually order and install its

 like the first, but with some bells and whistles, including a camera to use with it.
The team says that its goal is to make the camera portable and easy to use that also happens to also be the best mobile camera you can buy. It’s a small thing, sure, but it’s a change.
The M2 is also waterproof, of course, and it works just fine. And it comes with the iPhone 5C, too.
All in all, it’s a good camera in a package that shouldn’t cost more than $200, and likely less than $100 at either price or weight. Plus, since it’s being made of the same plastic it is (the aluminum alloy is much more durable thanks to the sapphire), it’d probably be harder to be lost than the M3 under some circumstances, and a lot easier to find after it’s been through testing. The M2 is also slightly cheaper and a little more powerful, thanks to the quad-core chip added to the A7 processor of the iPhone 5C.

There are also two M3 owners that were provided with our early access to the iPhone 5P. Both seemed to have problems with the wireless charging, and with no more than a few days of use, but neither one said they had it turned on, or that they’d turn it on once it came out.
There’s room for M2 slates, since it should be very solid, the M4, which only needs two hands and weighs up the heaviest for a lot of people who might be interested in its pro-phone credentials. And thanks to the NFC, there’s also a chance we’ll see a bigger phone in the future – it’s just not yet clear what’s going to happen.
The M2 is available for pre-order on Newegg in the U.S., which is good news on that front."
"The iPhone 5C was Apple’s first major innovation by way of design and form, and this new Apple Watch Edition isn’t exactly an outlier product.
That’s a good thing considering Apple typically builds these limited edition watches, for the iPhone 5S, the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 4.
Still the Apple Watch Edition is more expensive than the new iPhone, at $200 with pre-order and retail availability and a limited edition of 500 units, or $450 for an iPhone 5 with pre-order and retail availability (the iPhone is a $399 entry-level phone, after all). That’s quite a steep price, considering that the company still hasn’t released its next iPhone in the high-end price range since the iPhone 5, which is likely adding up, too – the 5c is also just over $200 with pre-order and selling prices. Still, Apple’s price point remains solid in our current configuration, which is good news for the market as a whole."
"Apple’s new mobile payments feature in iOS 10 likely won’t live out the feature’s full potential, due to a few hardware and software limitations, but a new report from Reuters fought around the potential of Apple’s new mobile payments system.
The Apple Watch smartwatch could be used to perform more sane transactions and make purchases by way of the iWatch, according to Reuters, thanks to its use of a touch panel which controls a payment terminal. Reuters says that Apple is working on a solution to the potential problems with using a touchless, one-click payment terminal on a mobile device.
The report comes from Bloomberg’s Nick Fox, but the underlying concept is a guession of sorts, and isn’t likely to be entirely out of the ordinary – Apple has talked with the company in the past about its intentions to integrate its payment system with its hardware to address its challenges. It’s actually been reported by the Wall Street Journal, but that’s simply another rumor, and there’s nothing denying the veracity of the source.
The new report could suggest that Apple is working on a technology which would allow for card-based payments on mobile, which would work both on the web as well as mobile thanks to the Touch ID and Apple Pay APIs. That could mean mobile payments via Apple Pay, or even Apple’s iWatch integration, as the WSJ notes. Whether it would also be used to make actual purchases at point-of-sale remains to be seen, and the Apple Watch in iOS 10 would also support this.
Apple Pay could offer a way for people to make purchases using their iWatch in physical retail, for example, which the WSJ notes is already built into iOS, along with other wearable tech.

 challenge, but I think what a new startup like Yodo 1 does to a lot of startups in the future is that it gives them a much better valuation figure as part of the transaction — I don’t think the founders of companies like Dropbox or Airbnb really understand this. But they have enough credibility in their organizations to know they can’t simply keep this value out of the equation and devalue it.
It also gives them a way of building a company that they would want to be around for the long-haul. That’s the key value proposition. And that’s not a crazy idea."
"Foursquare just announced that it expanded its API. Previously known as check-in, the company made this news last week after two big-ticket acquisitions.
I wrote last week about Foursquare’s acquisition of Burpards, which was for more than just location based check-in (i.e., a check-in like you see in Foursquare). At the time, Nandini Chittoor, Foursquare’s CEO, said that Burpards was an early version of his company’s API, allowing the company to expand its service in a much deeper range than Burpards did during its early days.
I’ve heard that this is a big part of what the deal with Burpards was about expanding access to new services as a basis for how Foursquare decides on its API for future use, along with the fact that Foursquare has been doing a lot of product and work on an account-based, location-based loyalty program — one that also includes rewards, of sorts. 

As a result, I expect to see some new APIs in the future, too.
Here’s a short explanation of how the new API works:
The new API allows Foursquare to add a new type of search to its API, as well as another type of location-based search. For example, if you’re looking at something like what’s up between your check-in on Foursquare and the check-in on Yelp, you’ll be able to easily search the entire Foursquare, not just places like restaurants or airports. This is yet another important way that Foursquare has differentiated its own service from others in the location-based search space, since it provides a way for a business that’s not based in mobile to utilize location-based search across mobile, web and big screens.
It’s another way for Foursquare to differentiate from the rest of the market of location-based apps that use GPS to try to guess where a user is going, and then provide locations based on that, even when there’s no direct API involved. (Other, more mobile-first apps like Yelp, for example, use GPS to power location-based search.)
As someone who works with lots of APIs like this, and is aware of the benefits of the API approach, I can see the value. But I’m wondering whether people are interested in that kind of system, and that’s my point. Maybe one day this data will just be a set of APIs that any developer will simply have to use.

"I’ve been covering travel and culture on more than one venue as a professional since 1985, covering sports, movie show, TV, technology and more.
I like my travel, and I was at one point at one point after I was trying to sell my travel company to Travelocity. They wanted to sell me a one-off hotel pass, an experience that I didn’t have – or wouldn’t have – until I did. I left the hotel business because I wasn’t earning enough money in that business.
I ended up in this situation after many of my travel partners wanted to go that route, and wanted to give me more money than I agreed to pay for a business pass. But I wanted to sell the whole hotel business, not just one trip per year. This means that all the hospitality money I was making off more than 100% of the guests booked on my bookings had to go to me.
The travel part of travel is a tricky business.
On one hand, it’s the challenge to find qualified travelers who have travel expertise, who are travel experts, who will work with the host to go travel. On the other hand, the trip is also a financial burden to the host, with airlines, hotels, restaurants/bars, etc. making a significant profit on these services.
So hotels might have to bid to sign a short-term contract with the hotel, which potentially gives them more money to make.
But it’s a tough call. Many hotel owners don’t see the benefits of the trip and want

s “social network before it was too risky to take the plunge.” 

Facebook launched Messenger back in 2011 to do a better job of capturing and highlighting all the ways that our devices and social networks now connect. With Facebook (or any network, really) you always have your own set of interactions. People ask, “Which of these social networking apps are better for privacy?” But many of them still fall into the social networking trap, especially if they only offer more Facebook status updates or if they don’t have any other activity and content. When users do post something, they share it with the world. 
Instagram tried to solve some of that same issue by debuting self-destructive photo sharing in Instagram 5 (early version of the app). There, it allowed users to take and share pictures that would have otherwise been buried in Instagram due to the shortsighted nature of that sharing.  
But the move alienated many users — the majority of whom never even made it to the third page, let alone the first one. Users hated the added social  flag on the photos to the right-hand side. They felt it could devalue the Instagram brand and make it less sticky, which hurt the service’s growth.
That was never the intention behind Facebook launching Poke. 
Poke was a Facebook bug. There was no malice in it — just a mistake. Just like Poke, the feature failed when Facebook tried it. Sure you could have poked from the right-handed side of Facebook to see how to friend someone, but Facebook is the center of the social web. 
When Facebook was hacked, users had to get creative and figure out who had committed the crime. Poke was just one of many flaws of its first launch, and it remains in the app store as a broken link. 
Now that Facebook is taking a swing at the social network without Poke and the rest will come to pass, it will take some user grace and patience to find a way to continue Poke’s growth. I’m looking at you, Snapchat."
"Twitter and YouTube are a nightmare to watch. If you’re just trying to see what people are saying now and not how crazy live-streaming videos are, it can be rough.
Well, now Twitter has made it a lot easier to follow conversations. You can now easily hit “follow” on Twitter to follow the conversation right in the timeline. Just tap on the new conversation icon in your chat thread. You need a hashtag? That’s the one to know.
For example, let’s look at you:
Facebook and YouTube have had comments for a long time. There are a growing number of sites that allow users to set up profiles, and the comment window has gotten way larger than Twitter’s. So why does Twitter exist? Because Twitter is too difficult to follow without digging in to some general recommendations. With any other social network, the only way to get a straight answer is to look for someone in the Twitter stream. Not everyone wants to go to Twitter right now. That said, you have to do a good job of following other people you want to learn from.
Twitter is also not an easy platform to use without spending hundreds of hours a day in it. There are a lot of sub-steps in Twitter where you have to be organized to do something useful. This makes the experience a little bit clunky. For example, the follow button may be the key to making this system stick without all the work.
This is where Twitter has come out with a clear winner. Its users are actually organized enough to organize this social network without losing so much faith in Twitter. With that, Twitter can be flexible to change its platform and make everyone happy. By having users follow conversations, the company can experiment on that front. It’s a big difference from YouTube and Facebook, which only need to follow every once in a while for the novelty of them to comment. Twitter can become more like Facebook, where the first person is king and the users are on the site. It is where people interact publicly. It doesn’t always make sense, to be honest, but with Twitter being all you have to do, it’s actually a much more natural thing."
"The Twitter user-created Twitter Moments feature that debuted earlier this month lets you create a short, looping audio file that can be shared to other devices with the tap, like the iPhone’s camera. At a high-level, it can be a way to broadcast real-time information that can then be played back to TV, set-access computers and connected TVs – as is the case with the BBC’s iPlayer.
Today, the BBC recently debuted a set-top box that includes a number of the BBC’s in-house-created content (including that famous “banned news” feature) but isn’t

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
. The project cost was about $3.4 million in total.
So what does Uber do with that money? Its initial use case was to grow its engineering team. Now, of course, it’s also making money at the same time.
Uber has an API model — its core value proposition — and an initiative to open a platform to help developers build out apps. As a platform, Uber users and developers are happy to support each other. We just use that as a lens to view the other side of the story. When you build a great app, you can then develop other platforms and services out of your app. But when you build a technology-oriented product like Uber you need to consider whether you are the developer that will build the revenue side of that company. With an additional platform come marketing and distribution and more developers using that platform — so a more expensive investment.
It’s an incredibly expensive and vulnerable approach to acquiring users. Uber has a lot of hiring power, it makes money for customers, and its network effects. What’s in the platform vs what matters to the customer — the business. With Uber, the focus has shifted to a more targeted user acquisition model.
That strategy will pay off, if Uber can demonstrate real traction and use its platform to tap out consumers in a new way. Then it can gain more users, and then it’s a question of whether the customers will be willing to sign up for the Uber.
Uber has shown this with its growth. It could get the attention of consumers. That could be good news for drivers. If it looks like Uber is going to find ways to make $10 services more valuable than a taxi cab, there are bigger opportunities to make money. And to give consumers a choice, Uber is trying to tempt them away by claiming they’re driving a car. That they look around for transportation options, that would be less convenient or expensive. By tying the car-to-life brand as an advantage it will gain more drivers and more drivers signing on.
That argument could make people more receptive to the company. And this is where the $5 billion valuation comes in. Now think about the $10 billion figure, or whether Uber could be ready to look to generate money, such as selling a dividend to investors when it wants to. When asked, Uber has shown it has the potential to continue to expand its user base, extend into new services, and sell time-savings to the service. It’s a clear way to use a platform to monetize the service so the user’s habits will be set up to pay for it.
But is the investment in Uber the big goal here? Yes, it’s not going to be, but it also wants a new market for a new business.

Uber’s biggest idea is to disrupt the transportation industry. In the 20 most-recent years, it has becomed a huge-finance vehicle that provides the ride, the driver, the logistics and the logistics, making Uber into much more of an Amazon distribution model. But now it needs a platform to make more people’s lives easier and safer. Uber says that the company needs an Uber for everything, and this latest round is only a precursor.
This time around, Uber has a big opportunity to connect people with places. It is a company that people use in all kinds of areas as well. But today it’s more focused on driving itself across a market."
"Facebook today noted its first-quarter earning, with sales of $337.63 million and net income of $121 million from the $337.03 million in sales. That’s record-for-Q2 earnings from its first three months in a row.
Analysts had asked when the stock would go on sale to price investors in the $1-3 range, and its timing appears to be meeting well. Today, Facebook notes that earnings excluding the quarter have increased, and this time by $1.25 billion on a total $0.0516. Facebook’s share price has not opened or sold for a solid year, and is up 17.5%, or $0.0413,  since its debut.
The earnings come on the same day as a few other tech companies whose shares have risen in after-market trading to a position of valuation of $10 billion or more, with a huge $8.63 billion in turnover according to the most recent Reuters report: Instagram, Tumblr and Facebook, as well as other e-commerce services like Zappos.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 that the new hardware in the Galaxy S4 is only shipping with its 2.2GHz Quad-Core processor clocked at 2GHz, which is 2x speeds faster than the Samsung Exynos quad-core processor on Galaxy Note II and SII, but a still very modest 2.1GHz.
All these improvements are likely good for the U.S. market, which probably isn’t a great choice for an Android device at this point in time: a recent study out of China from IDC noted that Android currently ranked as the third most popular platform in Asia in terms of sales, as it followed, and now ranks in the 50’s. Samsung says that’s not necessarily a sign that it will see any of those growth rates out of the gate, but the fact that it does appear to be growing the global market — and the U.S. specifically — could be an indicator of the company building the necessary hardware for a big, potentially global market in the wake of the release of these S4s.
Samsung is using its own software on other devices, to differentiate it from other Android makers, but even as it heads for more revenue-generating opportunities, that’s not something it appears likely to be able to do to compete toe-to-toe with — or even close to competently, against — Android by virtue of its own software. The company has already managed to drive very strong margins in its handsets, but in order to do so it would need to look to other avenues, while it also competes with other and often cheaper hardware makers.
The biggest new feature on the phone isn’t the camera, despite the name and general description. It’s the software: Samsung’s new custom UI is a departure from vanilla, with a selection of animations that appear throughout the UI so that you don’t get lost and can quickly get accustomed to its interface. The animations use facial recognition technology, but in terms of the experience, I found them lacking as compared to what you’ll find on Google’s mobile devices, something that is likely to be a concern among some smartphone users (the animated tiles of the launcher apps don’t capture the same level of clarity and polish as the iPhone 6’s).
In terms of performance, the phone does perform well, with the exception of the camera. That’s because the phone lacks a front facing camera, and instead relies on software to create its camera, with the smartphone simply handling the image processing. That’s still a fine distinction for the phone at this point despite Samsung’s claims in terms of the phone’s camera tech, but by and large it’s hard not to miss the fact that Google’s Android launcher apps use software to simplify its interfaces, and while the Galaxy S4 uses more advanced software, it still comes across as more of a polished hardware experience.
The new UI is interesting in that it puts Samsung at greater control over the look and feel of its UI, whether that’s the choice of home screen or whether it’s customized to your individual tastes. The reason I’m personally opting for the latter is largely tied to the fact that I’m more of an activist when it comes to smartphone interface design, at least on the software side. I’m not a huge fan of the ‘flat’ design, and in fact I think that it looks a lot worse on Samsung devices than on other Android OEM hardware currently on the market. And, perhaps most importantly, I have a hard time seeing a seamless transition between Android’s current fluid on/off-app design direction with the UI additions. If the new UI takes shape as a result of user choice, it will in theory offer more opportunity for Samsung to differentiate in a crowded marketplace, while giving it two years to do a good job of iterating its UI in terms of attracting new users by making it easy to switch between apps.
On the software side, though, Samsung’s custom UI is already in place on Samsung smartphone devices, with software additions to take things like voice and SMS out of the mix. That’s probably not a good thing, as voice and SMS remain something of a pain on most Android devices, and it remains unclear as to whether users will be excited about voice — probably because it doesn’t offer all that useful new functionality, especially when you’re asking on multiple smartphones."
"Apple has a new update out for iOS 8 out of the gate, which includes more functionality geared toward developers, including a new interactive ‘Discover’ page that offers curated pages and videos about key app features. It’s a big change from the previous version, when it was mostly developer focused.
The ‘Discover’ section is really the one big change here, which is where apps and games are getting featured and highlighted in ‘Discover

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 looking to get a quick, hands-on in-depth look at virtual reality and do a little virtual surfing.
The Kickstarter campaign aims to get the Vive to market in Asia this year — a timeline confirmed by the company.
It will retail for $399 in bundles which the company has sold to multiple gamers since it ran a Kickstarter campaign in beta last year. The bundles include a pre-order discount of $399 for a gaming bundle, with another option of $599 for a “premium” bundle with a headset. Which bundle will get what kind of treatment (cord, ear, and screen upgrade, etc). you’ve been chosen for your VR experience and which bundle has your favorite?
The Vive is also not only being targeted at a specific audience, but also a bunch of mainstream gamers. Its makers (and VR industry at large) are hoping that its price-tag can translate to some gaming enthusiasts looking to try virtual gaming on their own.
“I’ve been playing The Witcher with one of my friends since I was 8 years old…[it was like] the same experience we were used to, and the difference it did to us was massive,” said founder and CEO Philippe Dubou’s prior CV.
He reckons the market for VR and VR-related gadgets will be insanely hard to ignore, especially since a number of similar VR headsets — notably, the Oculus and the Morpheus — are still marketing themselves as VR headsets. Yet it’s less obvious how the tech/console VR experience will work in terms of a player’s positional position and posture.
“There’s obviously a huge expectation of presence for motion,” added Dubou. “That was one of the things we did to think about — we thought we should figure out how do we deliver it, and how do we really solve that in a way that’s easy to use, and as intuitive as possible. That’s number one our list as a VR category. And, the other part is, once you get in the habit of having a ‘comfortably close’ headset you can switch your position without having to actually adjust the headset, but it’s really that immersive feeling that’s the kicker.”
“Because the peripheral [with the controller] has a natural movement in it — if you look at it, your position just went through what you’re doing. And you’ll have a very visceral, very immersive experience,” he added.

So, on the plus side, it’s looking very bright, very clear, and still has room for your display — and there’s no reason why your whole body is being directly probed and photographed. What’s to stop people asking for more?
You can reserve your units by buying them here, though they were delayed by a bit, though you can just go and pick one up by going to Amazon and ordering them directly from."
"“I don’t think we need to spend too much of our time asking about what other platforms we should expect it to have an element of. The important thing is it gives us the data. Data makes us a better performer, and there are good ways to go to market” says CEO and co-founder of Pricing Pixel, which makes the camera for Fitbit and other wearables. With its fitbit device, Pricing Pixel launched its first commercial run on an iOS device last month, following last summer’s gruelled public beta launch.
Since then it is rolling out several more beta versions of its system, including an update to the Pricing Pixel iOS app — with a focus on mobile fitness tracking. So, as well as continuing to build revenue, Pricing Pixel said the new Android app is a way for it to be sure its software is feeling all right.
“A new Android app, called SportTuner, is designed to be used with the Fitbit wearable so that it will remember what your exercise level is. It will remember what your sleep bioacute is like and so on and so on,” CEO and co-founder of Pricing Pixel, Ian Fincher, told TechCrunch.
“We’re developing a new product for the new Android Wear platform, and in the next three to four weeks time hopefully we’ll be bringing this to other platforms like wearable. We have already started developing a few prototypes,” he added.
Pricing Pixel is not currently taking any revenue for its wearable cameras, rather its business model is based

 a first step for a larger company. After all, the most compelling technology innovation usually results in an acquisition as companies try to build up their own capabilities."
"Apple’s iPhone 6 (and 6 Plus) are getting a big update today, with the introduction of the new 64 GB and 128 GB capacities. But new reports suggest that the 128 GB model is better at meeting the needs of users demanding more storage space, and in fact have been speculating on the model in the past. Apple didn’t announce the storage capacities with the iPhone 6 models, in fact, so we didn’t hear much about them today outside our live event for the new phone.
According to Gigaom, which first reported the specs this morning, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models are having improved wireless networking technology, with gigabit Ethernet networks being available for both. That makes for a network that uses twice as much data as before for connectivity-intensive use. And the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are also capable of both cellular and wireless data connectivity in almost any country, the report claims.
The report also claims that the new network connections could be used with cellular on-device services, which is a bold claim in a world where carriers only offer cellular connectivity for devices which are significantly different from traditional smartphones. Mobile data on smartphones is still largely a one connection effort, after all.
The good news for those buying a new iPhone, however, is that Apple’s new carrier partner, Verizon Wireless, appears to be the go-to for on-device data connections. And if that weren’t enough, Apple also announced last week that you’re free to switch carriers over to the new network, in another bid for network lock-in with the iPhone 6 Plus. But it also sounds like the new models will get Verizon support sometime in the future (in fact, AT&T was supposed to be showing its first iPhone 6 support test this week!).
Apple also mentioned at today’s event that wireless data networks are growing more quickly worldwide, and that 4G will likely get much faster."
"Apple announced the launch of the Apple TV today, a set-top streaming box like Roku and Xbox, and, of course, a new Mac. In terms of design, it looks very similar to Amazon’s Fire TV. But where Amazon was focusing its energy, Apple had been focusing on delivering a beautiful TV experience for the new streaming box.
That all changes with the Apple TV’s “TV OS,” which allows users to configure the platform as a service platform and a native TV service in just three clicks.

However, that’s not the whole story. Apple TV has more than a few features that don’t make the whole platform as convenient as it could. For starters, you should be able to browse the App Store using Apple TV, and from there, the only hard thing to do, assuming you even own an Apple TV. What value will you get?
There’s probably little value to the Apple TV as a whole besides, you know: TV Mode. That is, there’s no way of telling you what things you should expect in the background when you open the set menu. For example, if you want to turn your Fire TV into a smart home theater center, you have to go to the control panel yourself. It requires another click — a double press — to do this.
Even more important, you have to use a Fire TV as a controller for other Apple TVs. You’re restricted to your devices, either. And if you happen to lose your iPhone, that’s a real problem. Your iPhone is fine until its owners are switching back and forth between your TV and your phone.
There’s also a special mode called ‘Play With TV’ which is great for cord cutters who only use the $35 Fire TV to control other Apple TV devices. For instance, the whole family can use TV Mode to get their own TV service.
But for a big chunk of people, this probably isn’t the best choice. It’s more than enough for those who need the Internet on their Apple TV. Apple TV is more convenient, though, when you’re watching TV.
Apple CEO Tim Cook demonstrated how the new TV offers a better experience for the typical mainstream user when it comes to basic streaming media streaming and movie access on your laptop, PC, or smartphone — or, yes, iPhone and iPhone.
The new iOS, too, is ready to run OS X users rejoice. Its new native apps are just about perfect, and that means that OS X users can start streaming and watching their favorite favorite shows right on their computers.
The Apple TV has a share of the $200 price tag, and some may say it’s a steal."

commerce. In this case, the idea of adding data analysis to the process of creating a data plan and choosing one for future use could come with a drop in cost, if people were already saving from aggregating all available news content, too, or it was simply too much hassle or expense.
The service is only available to customers with an email plan (a premium model that’s currently $50/year), and the price of access depends on the amount of data. This is a similar to other content delivery startups like Grabyo.
The company has raised $1.8 million in funding before being acquired.
This isn’t the only data analytics platform that’s being built today, you can be sure. There are another three, all of which you can check out.

However, as with any data analytics startup, there is a lot of competition for attention.
“We feel that the data analytics space is a much deeper space than we thought, and we have a lot more work to do in figuring out which products will win the competition – which the companies, which are starting in the analytics space,’s the big bet” says Srivastava, when asked who his own bets on this space. “We’ll see how it plays out, so there’s the data analytics play, we’ll see how it plays outside of us.”"
"Palo Alto Networks (which has a number of competitors), has been around for the last several years, with the long-term goal of using machine learning to get more data for more people, and then turning that into better network services. But for now, most of its attention — like any big data play — has been to the small business market, which is seeing an increasingly fragmented ecosystem today. Now a seed investment company called Pioneers Networks, which has created the Pare, its first product, for small business users, has raised $3.65 million in venture funding.
Why the funding?
“While enterprise data is a huge focus and growing, the real need for Pare is for small businesses,” said Dhramati Malavalli, CEO of Pare, in a statement. “At Pare, we’re focusing on the small business market first, before we go into enterprise.”
Specifically, it will allow Pair to provide businesses with real-time access to their personal, financial and social accounts like their email, social media accounts that they may use in work, and more. Also, Pare can provide recommendations for specific use cases, like managing billing and bill payments for an office staff.
The investment comes from the team at Pico, which raised about $1.5 million from Pinnacle Investments, Intercapital, Pinnacle Ventures, and angels including Bob Marley and Brian Lee.
Pair is still in beta and is taking signups now."
"This morning, Google announced the debut of a new version of the Doodler app, which, among other things, would be the company’s first in-vehicle integration with Android. Beginning March 1, beginning in some 100 U.S. markets, the app (with Android-compatibility coming at some time later this year) will no longer be limited to users based in California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Illinois and Massachusetts — rather than just across the states that are currently on the list of those that will get the app first.
Previously, Doodler users — which are available as a free download or via a subscription-based service to stream or listen to music to web-based or offline content — could only access their music, photos, and message catalogs from outside the app. Now they will be able to access everything they can look for in their digital music library on Android (including photos, songs, videos and docs) without the restriction imposed by Google’s app.
The service will start rolling out to all of the 32 million plus users in the U.S. by the end of March, says Eric Schmidt. Now, not only is access to the Doodler app available in the markets where Google is live — and it’s free (or, as CEO Bijan Sabeti puts it, “our way of getting the word out”) — it’s also where many of you will be able to use Google Voice to, yes, play your music and video selections from Spotify or Rdio — or many other services based in on search history.
The Doodler app is also going to have more features and integration, with new APIs coming in the next few months, according to Sabeti.
For starters, for those who use their phones as much as an Internet-connected device (like those that you plug

"A lot of developers love to complain about bugs. So today, Facebook launches a new bug bounty program called Bug Bounty.
The Hacker News blog explains:
Facebook launched the Bounty program for Android developers, and here’s what Facebook’s VP of Product Marketing for iOS James Purcell said on Hacker News:
Here’s what Purcell told Hacker News about the Bounty program:
What Purcell said was that this bounty will allow Apple users to track down the elusive bugs they find. The bounty will go full effect in September 30.
Bug Bounty is a new product that isn’t about fixing security or promoting app downloads. It’s about getting users to fix bugs. Purcell explained that Facebook uses a two-tiered system, with a bounty for bugs and a smaller, more affordable Bounty for fixes.
Bug Bounty has its roots as a service that Facebook already offered. Developers could submit bugs for bugs. If the bug was fixed, Apple would pick up the bug and send Facebook money. If it wasn’t fixed, Facebook would pick up the bug and send back the money.
Now, Facebook wants to change that system and offer this kind of bounty to all developers. There’s no mention in the company’s blog about the Bounty program.

"Social data startup Gnip has expanded its capabilities by acquiring Sanitized data-gathering platform M.N.O. This allows data scientists to pull data from a bunch of different sources to do their own analysis and insights. “We’re talking about huge value,” said Natalie Dold Miller, Gnip’s CEO. “The whole team moved over to M.N.O. We saw the opportunity and did a purchase."
"Social news service Newsle, which began life in 2007 as a “Facebook for Tumblr”, is today making a big decision. The company is no longer officially a Tumblr website, as it looks to better align itself with the Tumblr community – a community which has grown to over 60 million members over the last 12-odd years, but is still evolving into a more “online” news provider.
The change comes at a time when Newsle is moving further away from its roots – something that may have first sparked its use case and helped contribute to its growing community, more than a decade after its founding. The shift takes place not because of any external pressure on Tumblr to move toward an advertising or content-based model. But even with changes and that shift comes the ability to share publicly.
“We were always advocates of Tumblr’s importance to users,” explains co-founder and CEO James Stahura in an interview. “We had a lot of users from Tumblr, and we were pretty good about it. People had asked for the same things – to use a Tumblr address for online contacts, to post their ‘Tumblr blogs’ to Facebook, to post their ‘Tumblr selfies’ — and all these things started growing. You had 100 million people reading these posts.”
The first step to making those requests was with the “Tumblr Post,” a post that was posted to the service’s public-facing page which now went live. From then on, users could subscribe to the post with their own Tumblr profile to post to the Tumblr blog. And when the post was shared beyond the network, it reached 10,000 shares, and people featured it on Facebook.
The next phase was a product called “Tumblr Check,” which Stahura introduced earlier this year, which he says is a “premium analytics package like we already offer on the Tumblr network.”
At the end of March, Stahura began talking with other Tumblr executives including CEO David Stewart and CTO Eliot Boyles about bringing an ad product to Tumblr and other parts of its network so that advertisers could better target their messages.
At the time, the two decided to expand the sale on Tumblr itself. Today, Stahura says they brought it in and, after some “scrutinizing and discussion,” they are ready to announce it publicly.
“We’re trying to build a revenue-generating business here with Tumblr and then we hope to potentially sell it in the future,” Stahura tells us.
With that revenue base on its new paid products, Stahura says

 use a company’s technology in the context of the enterprise — particularly when these are non-invasive, collaborative services, like chat services and the like. SeatGeek makes the most sense for large businesses where staff often needs to be engaged through internal communities and discussions, as the company points out in its blog post explaining its application to the enterprise. SeatGeek, the company says, is being brought to the next generation of SaaS platforms, now that they offer a new way to communicate. “The future is chat, group messaging and voice,” the company says.
To become a part of the enterprise enterprise, startups and apps have to offer a novel way to facilitate customer conversations. “We believe that a mobile device is the best way to achieve change in an enterprise context,” writes Schindler. “We see mobile and chat as the future of enterprise communications, especially in the cloud. Chat and chat rooms can no longer be an abstraction strategy. We are focused on providing clients with a single-page communication solution that makes their experience more collaborative and relevant to customers”.
Although he says “the future is chat, group chat, collective text– and group discussions.” These are two completely different trends, and while one is undoubtedly a larger growth trend than the other, these three should be considered a complementary movement in the enterprise (and more on their different paths) — rather than as if they’re somehow distinct. It’s in fact the same trajectory that LinkedIn is following with the “unifying” strategy it’s making to become a communication platform across all of its services.
Schindler points out that in his experience at LinkedIn and Salesforce, he’s seen a number of products that focus on working with and working with teams to communicate — like PagerDuty, Bizoo.com, TeamSpeak, Trello, Mention, Huddle, Zendesk, and more. “But most of these products are focused on a particular vertical, or on a single task,” he says.
And he points to Jelli as an example of a company working on a project around collaborative editing. “Jelli is a communications hub within Salesforce,” he says, “where you can connect your company’s email, calendar, contacts, content and applications.” Another example he cites is Jelli’s “product gallery,” where you can embed and share workspaces, applications and documents from across services.
Another area where we are seeing a lot of evolution in the enterprise is R&D — with a large and growing set of users across a number of channels. “We’ve turned this concept on its head and are now doing research into how we can create the most productive and relevant experiences for our customers and team,” he says. “And in this first phase, we’ve found a scalable, effective way to communicate through the Internet, which is not something that is trivial to achieve.”
But this is not just a new way of working. It’s also a new way of working. “It turns out that it’s also a new way of working better — it’s a new way of working that works just like other skills do, except that you’re doing it on the Internet,” Schindler notes.
It’s not surprising then that, with the new generation of enterprise SaaS software, it’s easy to turn these new tools into apps you can now interact with in whatever manner you wish. We are now seeing a new generation of tools that enable companies to manage their data and communicate from any device, and to use that data to support their own business decisions. It seems like this may soon start to matter for big businesses too: Cisco earlier today announced a new generation of applications that enable the company to use its own router to share data between its network members.
The networking metaphor is itself a bit of a surprise. Schindler describes technologies like the router that have emerged over the last 10 years as “removing the need for cables” or with mobile work environments that enable participants to share with others on the go. In fact, he argues that even today, you can share content across these networks on a “pass-to-data” basis. He says that in this environment, people “are starting to think more and more about how to use that information in order to personalize your life” — and that’s just the beginning.
There may be no “next-generation” router with wireless connectivity in sight, but Schindler believes there are many more such routers we need to learn about. “It’s not the next generation router or next generation router.” But the networks are not

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 a sales team in San Francisco or the Silicon Valley company that is taking a pivot to new technology. You are still the best at what you do. In some cases, you can lead product features, launch campaigns and marketing campaigns, but others require a greater level of technical expertise that is usually not available today.
Today it’s that the focus of a startup is that level of technical expertise that often will not pay off. That means that you are asking your sales team to tackle more difficult problems that they might not even know what to do.
One way to help is by having an experienced person. They are not someone who has worked at a large company like Facebook, Google or Stripe, where the company might have hundreds of employees. They are people who have expertise to help you with problems that you might not have the money to solve and the company may find that they don’t have the time.
If you are a startup, you don’t have time to deliver something right away. The amount of time they have now is to the end from whatever product you are working on; right now, they are just to help you with whatever you might want to build. This is not the most challenging problem you can solve, but it’s not the least challenging problem either of these problems.
If your team lacks technical expertise — you don’t know if they are engineers. It doesn’t mean that your team will not be able to complete a project. I know from my own experience that the people whose idea it is that are really not terrific at building products. For these people, it can be more about how to make the final product, the experience of the product and its design.
I’ve seen a good number of product teams with great engineering talent. I know hundreds of them. When the product is ready or has a solid user-base, they are better people. But when it goes wrong, the team may not be ready to handle that problem. I know that this can also slow down a product, especially if it is something new for them and they are new to the space.
Another common trend in the space is that the majority of startup engineers and product teams don’t have any outside connections — their only exposure to entrepreneurs and investors might be Facebook contacts.
If these individuals are not entrepreneurs that want to get their first investments, there is no reason why these guys can’t be mentors. But if you need to talk to investors without a connection, there seems to be a gap of opportunity.
The first thing to do is do a little research. Ask yourself, “what could I tell you about the product that I would recommend?” Know what it is — whether it be something that has already been used by the majority of your team — whether it be Facebook, Slack or WhatsApp or Instagram.
This is where you are going to find a way in which you may end up investing. Know who your team may have the experience for this product.
As they continue with the conversation and find more questions to tackle, you can do a lot of good. But, as a founder, you have to take an approach that is very much “ideal.” Know not only who is going to be most likely to start that conversation, but your own preferences.
Once you know a little bit of what you want to accomplish, it starts to make a lot more sense. I don’t mean the product team will always be the best at it. Sometimes, you’ll end up with a product that works well and seems like a great deal, but is not as great as you initially hoped.
You may also want to be careful with what you are asking the investors. Be sure it goes that far. If you ask for a number, and they can’t give you more, and you do not get to the point, you will quickly realize it’s too late. And it’s not always just in the best interest of the investor to deal with you. Sometimes the best interest is of the team. Once you know the answer, you can take the team and your product and look for people with similar expertise that you are interested in.
You should be thinking about a lot of different possibilities. And if you think, “I can do this. I can do this without needing to know anything about startups.” Don’t be afraid to take that skepticism with a grain of salt, it may be useful advice. Remember, this isn’t the first time you have to make a decision. Take another chance and prove you deserve it."

Every time you think that startups have reached the size of a startup, the reality is different than most. And with each acquisition, the startups that start doing this will likely be more mature

 have been going a little more viciously down this road for years now — with Microsoft pushing to get an operating system to compete against the likes of Jolla’s Sailfish based Sailfish OS.
“The core of the problem is that these guys have gone down the right road… they’ve got the market, their customers and they’ve got the market dominance… The problem will persist until a major change happens as people will be unhappy with what they’ve bought into and their choice and what that choice is going to be,” says Martin.
Now it’s not clear how many customers would support such an initiative, or whether Nokia would be getting funding directly back to finance its work on the platform. But it’s likely that Nokia is not doing this with open arms.
One clue to that change is that Nokia is not getting a handset maker, just a platform that could be used to build upon another smartphone platform, and if you want to look at what customers are picking up as buyers, it’s likely they would not be choosing Nokia to sign up to that.
But also, what it will be interesting to see is the business strategy — at least the tech — behind it. If Nokia wants to be in the business of selling its own smartphones, as Nokia has in some markets, then this will be a difficult business to be in given that the company doesn’t build a complete phone business, and also doesn’t have an app store at its disposal — and it will be a very lean company with operations like this. It’s not clear whether Nokia’s operating strategy will be based on licensing, licensing on the hardware side, or both.
If Nokia were to take a very mobile-centric approach with this, then it’s hard to see how it would have been able to put on a mobile handset without Nokia’s technical assets on tap; and how it fits in with Sailfish and the wider ecosystem.
It’s hard to imagine how much influence Nokia could have had in the Android ecosystem with the Android Open Source Project that it launched in 2009. If the Open source project had never existed, then Nokia would have to build on top of it, which of course they would have needed to do, and in some cases would have needed a very different Android strategy, and that’s not even a bad thing to do in some markets, like it would be in the U.S.
From the other side, Jolla is now working on an emulator for Android (because Jolla has a different strategy to Android) that will allow the users to write code to Jolla devices. “It sounds a little strange to say it out loud, but it’s a great way to talk about it,” adds Martin.
So it’s clear to us, and not just to the consumers, but also to anyone who’s interested in the technology world that Nokia is now Nokia’s big business, as well as its other business that the likes of Eun (Facebook) and Samsung are now looking at, too. The new focus will be in the mobile space, where it’s unclear whether or not Nokia would take on the existing giant players of the Android ecosystem.
“I don’t think it’s a question of fragmentation. I think that we will see a sea change. If you look at what Amazon is doing, or Google is doing, they are all on the same trajectory. And I think that’s great for the consumer, but I believe it’s more significant in the ecosystem as well,” Martin said. “This sea change is more about different things: from the cloud to a mobile browser. People will become different. Some people will become more competitive, some less so.”"
"It’s been a while since I heard from Misfit, which had just launched its second-generation smartwatch, but the startup was actually doing quite well over the last few months. The new Misfit Gear S2 uses Android Honeycomb, and a host of Android Wear gadgets in a pretty colorful display that includes the smartwatch dock it introduced earlier this year.
As far as the tech itself is concerned, Misfit’s new smartwatch offers a much-improved smartwatch experience, one of the better ones I’ve ever had on my wrist. First, the new display is better-resolution than the original one you’re used to, and the new band is a better fit for every day wear. The battery life is about doubled from one year to six months, with a new micro USB charger, and the new charging head is much smarter this time around. This is Misfit’s first smartwatch with a dock.
The device itself is a

 and in the future — to find real world solutions in your community and to leverage the power of drones to perform amazing aerial feats. And that’s really all there is to it.
“It’s a pretty cool idea — we could take drones out and drop out a whole bunch of stuff,” says Nizdale. “If people haven’t been able to figure out, there’s a really high chance they’re never coming back from that. That’s basically what the idea is,” she continues.
The core model is a quadcopter quadcopter, or quadcopter in the more technical sense, with a control system and OS that can scale up to support different hardware controllers (or even multiple pilots) and drones. What’s more rather than trying to make one drone fly for multiple purposes and then fiddling with the controls, it’s trying to keep an eye out for the next big thing. So it tools drone control — but if there’s a problem with drones, there’s also a problem with the control panel, and it’s hard to see how this model would work really as it is designed. 
The core quadcopter quadcopter is an iterative prototyp of software as an immersive platform, or platform in the more tech-savvy sense. In other words it would rather be seen as a seamless, fluid are to be swiped through. So it’s designing a software environment that has multiple levels of complexity baked in so its controllers and sensors are always nearby. The aim of the software is to put a level of software magic into drones so they can just fly and drink.
The core quadcopter is a quadcopter, so it would also not be surprising to see it get a bit trier and its motor and camera and light sensitive. Such pads are required to build a drone properly, according to Nizdale, so it has to be easy enough to control their rotor across a room, and to build a drone that can stand up to more than two people. Although that’s not a drone for the hobbyist. Nizdale adds: “The drone for the novice user is more complicated. They have to teach themselves, and figure it out”.
“The drone has to be good at it’s own functions. I don’t want it to have too many functions just to handle some basic stuff.”
That’s not to say drones can’t handle our occasional small inconveniences. Nizdale gives the example of a drone that checks if the phone’s battery is low enough. “Some weird things people might want to check but I’m going to do whatever’s necessary to make sure the drone can handle a little obstacle or a big noise.”
So while quadcopters like the 3D-printed Zipbot are still in the realm of imagination, the design-focused imagination of designers, software engineers, software engineers and hardware hackers with a knack for creating stuff. There’s certainly no shortage of drone-inspired concepts. The sky’s the limit — as long as we put our minds to it.
Flying drones are the fastest-growing tech in the world at the turn of the year, according to Gartner, with an estimated global sales-rate of over 20.6 million — which is forecast to soar to over 32.6 million in 2017. So that’s plenty of devices that will figure prominently in a year and a half of flying.
The long and short of it is if the sky doesn’t fall, so be it."
"Amazon’s Prime Airline is about to undergo some changes to its core business, according to a new report from Amazon today. It’s going to split up its customer service and delivery into two units, the Amazon Echo, and Amazon Cloud Drive, which together will control the connected devices on its retail properties as well as those within it — Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos specifically names the Amazon Echo as the centerpiece of its connected device plan. It is also working with wireless hub company Wink for its Echo software, and that’s likely only going to help build out the overall scope of Amazon’s platform efforts as a whole.
The idea is that this is basically an extension of what customers already do with Amazon’s Cloud Drive, but CEO Jeff Bezos has gone further and said that the entire company will support them:

 up. If you want to see one, head on over here."
"On-demand mobile delivery services like Uber, WunWun, Postmates and other on-demand companies are bringing the neighborhood retail market online with their services, but some of the platforms also face regulation, both through cities, as its also differs from traditional taxi. In the wake of those differences, what seems to be the most interesting in the new on-demand space is how a startup may want to protect the drivers on its platform. Postmates, for example, may want to do more about customer support, while Uber is more willing to offer drivers insurance, potentially even protection against lawsuits for accidents or other accidents. (Uber specifically makes this point in its Terms and Conditions policy document).
Postmates declined to comment on this topic when asked by TechCrunch about this point last month when we asked about On-Demand Post-Delivery Service regulations which now differ to Uber in terms of driving, but we understand that it’s working out the kinks in regulations now."
"As the world moves to the smartphone and tablets, the industry in which it relies to function will continue to look a little outdated.
Take the big-ticket companies whose main business is in developing and selling a subscription-based version of their services that don’t rely on recurring revenue streams.
For many, an alternative model — i.e. one that is actually cheaper than the one being proposed, with a flat-rate of £69 per month — is an ideal option to grow revenue via services like Postmates and WunWun.
Postmates, and one of its first entrants into that market, is now charging £69.99 per month to operate an on-demand delivery service in the U.K. The service will also offer Postmates Pick-Up and Drop-off at 9am and 2pm, respectively. And it’s offering an in-app billing option in the U.S. Postmates, meanwhile, charges a flat $2 per month fee on top of Postmates Plus.
Other services that Postmates is moving into include delivery tracking via the courier service, and Postmates for businesses, as it looks to build out its services on top of some of those that it already has — that it claims to already have extracted an extra $13 million a year in gross merchandise value. Postmates charges an additional £3.25 per delivery item.
Postmates, which already delivers over 12 billion items to riders in 35 countries every month, is not new to the concept of how it will leverage these services in the future, either to expand out and build out more of the features that it offers for its users, or simply as an extension of what postmates does already offer. Postmates Grab is already available in London and Hong Kong, and is already a service available in Australia, Canada, China and Japan, as well as the U.K. and the Netherlands.
“The next step is to make a choice for customers. The choice is about what Postmates will, and should, charge, and when it will charge. No one will pay for Postmates Plus if they’re not going to pay something. And I think we will charge in the region of £9,” said Alex Nelson, the CEO and chairman of Postmates, today at the press conference with TechCrunch.
There have been other developments at Postmates over the last month that have, while not directly new, also come at the centre of the ongoing conversation about why Postmates is at the centre of this discussion.
The company recently bought courier space from a rival, just ahead of launching an on-demand delivery service for users in the U.K., although it’s not alone in trying out new models. Just earlier this month, the company acquired Zipments in the U.K. and South Africa.
And earlier this month, Postmates announced that it had brought on a new chief financial officer and is looking to increase its headcount in the current quarter. On that front, it is also announcing some changes to its global structure, too: namely the addition of two new executives to its UK and European headcount — Ian McInigal and Ian Smith.
Postmates has also more money than ever to burn. Postmates currently lists some 34 million transactions on its platform, and it recently raised an $11.3 million round led by Accel Partners at that valuation — making this a 37 percent stake that values Postmates at $180 million.
Update: Postmates has also confirmed the funding is in the region of $27 million, although said this figure is for last-minute changes to its pricing as a part of the process. “Postmates is $30-$35/month in the UK and in France

 promised, real-time, one in which you can pay just like on a real-world website. It will let customers set up a “store profile” for businesses, then offer these businesses a new, simple identity framework to incorporate in their websites.
This has been a hot concern for Google for some time, given that Facebook has been making headway on its own identity initiatives, and in particular on social interactions and the potential to offer a more “lessetwork-centric” Facebook-like service. At the same time, Google has been making a series of moves to provide more to its advertising network — on the one hand to help drive more money from the ad world; and on the other, to make sure businesses continue to run fine without worrying as much about Facebook-style micro-payroll.
Update: Google did not respond to a request for comment on this article.
Update 2: Google has clarified its statement further to me, saying that while the company doesn’t want to “comment on specific product plans,” the interest it will see from AdColony will be around “transforming the ad industry into the industry’s most efficient, transparent, reliable and effective platform for businesses to earn a commission on sales and commerce activity.”  
There is “no promise” to update the timeline with AdColony’s technology but Google is “taking to the position that the company is taking a step forward,” said the company.
Update 3: Here are a couple of others making an explicit point about the potential of offering a full-fledged advertising platform for businesses: Biba, an advertising startup founded in 2008, is also a potential route for them to come up with some new advertising platforms, and another one which will not be a part of their product offerings."
"Powervoice has raised $6 million in seed funding. The Series C, led by Lerer Ventures, follows a previous $2.5 million Series B in December, and brings the startup’s total funding to date to approximately $8.3 million. The funding brings Powervoice’s total funding to just over $32 million since its funding in October 2011. The additional funds, however, will be spread across three rounds of financing: an initial Series B round in February 2012, a Series A round in June of this year, and a Series D Round this September.
Primarily, the focus here is on bringing on small to medium-sized businesses (SaaS) a wider array of tools in which it offers services ranging from tracking online press, to online marketing, to social CRM apps and more. In this regard, it isn’t really all about “enterprises,” as CEO Alex Macpherson says that the company is really trying to reach small to medium-sized business owners the most right away. On the larger enterprise market, the focus is on big enterprises, he notes.
So why all the rush in of funding for a service that it already has? Macpherson says that in the first few cases it started as a simple question. “The original plan was, why would we do that? It seemed obvious,” he recalls thinking, “because I really have been doing this for 12 years. How do I let people make money when they already have?” Then came the idea of what you can do for money.
With that, he and his co-founder Mike Cagney founded Powervoice, but Macpherson soon discovered that there is actually a market to be disrupted for this model of online marketing services: that there are two types of revenue, and that money just makes it easier to do business on both platforms.
Powervoice, which has been live for six months, allows brands to collect customer testimonials, social media reviews, sentiment updates on Facebook and Twitter, and more using software as a service that has been proven for its users, Macpherson says. It then collects that sentiment data in real-time, and, in a follow-up service, automatically publishes reviews for users in the “best” style to its “brand pages.” The system then combines the reviews with comments and mentions in case the user is in the audience for the brand to use its “best reviews” feature in some form of social media outreach tools.

The service has also been running in a beta with a few hundred customers, and has been growing by leaps and bounds, thanks to its ability to track online press coverage and tweets. The startup, also founded by former Ask.fm staff, had raised $650,000 from Lerer Ventures before the seed round got announced.
Since the company launched its first beta, Macpherson says that the service has seen an average of $30 per user per month on its own, plus $50 per

. The price you pay to have an Uber is still a factor.
If you want to make a pickup, there are other places that will take you to. In New York City, there is a relatively smaller and cleaner Taxi-Dhaka sub-contraction, but if you want to go some places, a taxi won’t take you there."
"The Chinese e-commerce industry isn’t the only major global player going in this direction: mobile video-focused company MyTime is also ramping up its e-commerce presence in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong based company claims its app is already available on over 100 of the top 20 mobile sites in the region.
“We do not require publishers to have it,” MyTime co-founder and CEO and co-founder Julian Kwak said, adding that MyTime is giving a financial return from publishers.
To use the app, consumers must first add MyTime to their iOS App Store account before being given access to the Hong Kong store. Once they have, they will then be given the option of using their native app on both their iPhone and iPad, and their iPhone or iPad-based mobile camera. This dual app setup is the same as using a standard camera with an image stabilization plugin. Kak told TechCrunch that the camera will work over a similar video loop to GoPro’s standard setup but in the latter case.
To view the Hong Kong store, consumers have to download the Hong Kong app app first. The Hong Kong store is loaded with the latest stock photos, with a recent stock photo from a Singaporean store. Kwak said the company has ‘chosen’ Hong Kong, adding that “Hong Kong is just one of the places we would like to target.”
Despite Hong Kong being a market in itself, Kak added that Hong Kong is also “a good test” of what the service will do.
He declined to provide more details about how MyTime will do that, however, noting that the app has been used to view stock images and shop items. The app will also automatically flag the price in these photos, so that shoppers can be sure what they are getting.
“You will be able to see the real prices, the real sales prices online, [but] we also have other products,” he added that Hong Kong will not be a ‘store market’ because, in his words,  Hong Kong is the “financial hub of the world.”
In that sense, Hong Kong is not just for consumers but also for many businesses which are using it as a showcase of their own product, and also of how the mobile payment ecosystem is reshaping.

Kak said the Hong Kong marketplace will support a range of different shops, and the company also intends to open up further “channel” — such as the channel with retailers — beyond those that are already working with MyTime.
The app is already in Beta in Hong Kong, with several hundred stores signed up to bring it to life. Kwak said the crowdfunding aspect to the launch has been used to help in the development of the app, and to see how the app can be improved with more functions. But in the short term he has little to hold up his app — yet.
The Hong Kong marketplace is a big one. Kwak said MyTime has done $15 million in cash transfer transfers to date this year. The company is a cash-only venture. Kak explained:
On the flip side, the company has taken in a million dollars from mainland investors to date. Kak has not yet disclosed the total value of that transfer — but the founder himself, Hui Hu, would not reveal the exact size of the transfer.
MyTime said it is currently raising a Series A round at a post-money valuation of approximately $1 billion. Kak declined to confirm when it would be raising money this month — telling TechCrunch:
The Hong Kong marketplace and app is now live for any curious Hong Kong-based shopper or retail owner to download, albeit some technical difficulties may ham the mobile video app for iOS and Android. The app’s launch follows a raft of other services launching to mainland mainland Asian countries following the arrival of Apple and Google’s business model of offering consumers a one-stop-shop for buying products in the U.S. and Europe."

 tests to Google, to give people more time on both sides of the table.
“What we have in fact is one interesting piece of the [Valuable Activity] puzzle,” he said. “We don’t have any reason to believe that we’ll have any such activity.”
But if all goes into Google’s process of building an algorithm to suggest value to you, then other people might tend to be interested, too. As Numa co-founder (and former CEO of Unmetric, which spun out from Numa in 2012) Pierre Lavail told me earlier this year, most of the startups out there “aren’t making real money” yet they are already earning “substantial sums of money.” That’s not to say that things are always easy in this regard. While Numa has been focused primarily on advertising and marketing for its Numa features, the startup’s other ventures include a new product that will allow small businesses to communicate with visitors via its app — with that product called Numa Home.
The Numa founder also offered a more general prediction about how the technology that Numa is building will get used.
“When you think about where things come in [from Numa], we do it all the time,” Lavail said. “There will always be questions about how Numa will work in areas like advertising. But in the future, if people trust these decisions with Numa, they will go — and they will trust Numa. And we will have to make sure this always happens in the future.”
At present, the service works primarily as a plug-in that helps companies monitor activity and keep them abreast of the latest design trends. While Numa might be one of those company, Numa is also seeking out additional funding to hire more engineers and build further integrations between the Numa app and other business apps.
Lavil was not at pains to draw financials-related conclusions from the Numa funding — but Numa in itself is worth about $4 billion. The company was founded in 1989 and it has raised more than $65 million. And Numa is also in the process of building an app that helps people monitor their social media behavior.
Numa is also considering selling services like analytics and the ability to make money."
"We all assumed that Microsoft must be about to introduce a TV Everywhere in one of its upcoming television sets, but turns out it hasn’t just been quietly experimenting with a second-screen experience, but one that could help viewers better understand how best to view big events like the Olympics or Emmys on the big screen with live and on demand content from anywhere.
A startup called Streams (launching now on iOS, Android and Windows 10) is aiming to help anyone who wants to watch sports on the go and, instead of having them forced to jump through a bunch of hoops, Streams provides a realtime live feed of events happening in the world of rugby, football, baseball, hockey, soccer, football and many other games happening today.
Why would you want to watch this feed of games from anywhere? Well, you can already view it from a number of services, including Amazon Prime Instant Video, Hulu Plus, Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Sports Live and ESPN Events and it pulls this content from your web browsers. But Streams says it will deliver content to phones and PCs, so those on the go should no longer have to be concerned with downloading, as those streams are protected by various geo restrictions.
The app was co-founded by Dr. Michael Chasen, cofounder of MediStreams, Dr. Spero Machado, former president of World Service Group and a professor at one of the American School of Preventive Medicine, and Dr. James M. Corbett. Machado has a Ph.D at Stanford, and Machado is the co-founder of a healthtech company Meddik.
Chasen and Machado say Streams is different because it’s a product of their own in a world where consumers are increasingly accustomed to streaming content. 
Streams allows people to download the latest videos from anywhere in the world in seconds, instead of the hours they could have taken previously. It offers a free user experience, premium tiers for accessing the streams and mobile apps to make sharing videos, games and highlights at the push of a button.  
Unlike Facebook’s News Feed, Streams doesn’t pull any of its data, meaning that updates will arrive immediately to viewers. 
It also keeps viewers up-to-date on what’s happening in the world of rugby, a topic where numerous news outlets are looking to find ways to leverage the social graph to drive additional viewers.

 shift to the mobile world.
“I think the reason we started to gain momentum from that was through our mobile strategy of being a platform.”
That’s been a lot of progress — with more than 25 million mobile users in China alone, and more than 150 million users across the world in total.
But it’s not all roses. There are challenges ahead. Facebook is still struggling to live up to its promise of always-free updates, and there are signs that we may get more push notifications — not from notifications, but rather by the “big blue stuff” (namely Facebook) that is now the de facto global media company:
When asked what his company was most worried about, and whether it had a blanket aversion to user data, Zuckerberg said that if they have anything to say at all it is about how users are accessing its app from a variety of devices — be it on a feature phone or a phone, desktop or other mobile device.
What he said is that what you can want something better for everyone — mobile and web — but have to figure out where to go after all. Facebook seems to be no more interested in trying to force users to share more directly with Facebook the way that other messaging services do.
He also noted that the mobile user base itself is a bit more sensitive to issues. That means if the company decides to be all about mobile with all features and services you can only imagine what happens, as there still is lots of space in the mobile space.
He also pointed to the fact that the company has been a lot more open to experimenting with a bit of new stuff.
That, of course, has the potential to become the new way to share and get mobile users to pay attention to more more of the same.
“They love to experiment,” he said, pointing to the fact that the company has been making a lot of headway lately with Facebook Live and the Facebook API, and the fact that a few new services like Snapchat have also pushed it back into the mainstream.
He also pointed very recently to the fact that people are still willing to put their privacy aside in favor of trying new functionality. For many people who use Facebook, Spotify and probably pretty much every other service that you could name and there is some validity to that.
And he also noted that mobile has been a very popular way to access web-based services: “When I ask my friends, my friends will open up their browser and it’s not about any of our privacy. It’s about how long they use, and whether they actually look at a lot of our data. The other thing is that these guys look at everything on the mobile side,” he said. “They might be using Google Drive, and they see that this is obviously what they should be using too.”
It’s interesting and well-timed that his company has turned this all around as Facebook tries to play a larger role in how the general public interacts with the social networks that they use, and how its apps are used. The company started to feel like the media arena was losing steam, along with a growing number of startups that use Facebook to connect users with content and businesses. In some of these cases, services like Snapchat have succeeded more than others (Snapchat acquired Trusted Pixels in July), and many of these are based around the Facebook concept of ephemeral photos.
Facebook is a major market, of course, and this year’s acquisition would be a huge step forward for the company.
But there are a couple of points that are also worth noting about how it appears to be growing. These are that its share price has been falling for longer than on the share price of other companies that have gone public — the two are about the same, as it were. That has been the case for a few years now.
It’s that drop in price that Facebook is now worth at some $10b — that’s close — but it’s a bit of a turnaround for a company that has had three rounds of quarters of losses.
But this is also a sign of the company going as far as the willing. It’s not crazy to see how a big company has to try to manage its share price. If someone buys you and the company isn’t inclined to listen, that would be something that makes it easy to sell, and you could also see Facebook potentially be a buyer at a time when many other companies are pulling back from the public markets. It’s something that could become even more attractive if the companies start to go all in on their bets.
I’m not sure that the public markets might encourage companies like Facebook to buy. There are a lot of people who think that any large company, any company that might make revenue in a public markets and sell advertising to fund growth would make a public offering.

 in a release a statement. “We believe we are in the market for a disruptive app that has mass appeal to millennials and who want to communicate in a fun and engaging way.”
It sounds like an acquisition, rather than an acquihire, but with the amount of money Softbank is apparently willing to throw around, and the potential to develop apps for Twitter or YouTube, it would be difficult to imagine an easier sale.
While I’m a big fan of WhatsApp’s, and love using messaging apps, Twitter isn’t quite that popular, at least at this juncture. That could change soon, as Softbank has reportedly upped its offer to buy the company.
Twitter has to release some new apps soon, since tomorrow is its planned launch of #Twitter, where the service will be integrated with Twitter for Messenger. For now, the move would be pretty minimal, at least for any user — especially those who aren’t especially mobile. Even if Softbank’s latest CEO (and ex- CEO of Facebook) Andrew Torba is on board, he said in a recent email that Twitter will likely be launching three apps by the end of 2016.
The idea is to use Twitter to spread the word that you’re a startup by sharing your work, connecting with your network, as well as your passion. As a company, we’re sure we all miss that.

A lot of the activity we do on Twitter and on social networks is spontaneous. We follow an infinite number of accounts and follow others we care about. When an account is followed or Tweeted, our social graph builds up. For this reason, all we can do to respond is tweet back an account, and if we don’t have the app (or if SMS is the word of the word), we can’t come back to our original tweet, no matter how much the account has been retweeted.
The other aspect is how apps get used. Twitter has become an essential communication utility, both for consuming and sending information, so if any one app ends up being essential, it’s likely that some of them will end up being mobile clients and others will simply be Twitter clients as well.
There’s also the issue of how apps make money. Some apps pay for ads, but Twitter has traditionally charged developers to unlock the service for developers. It’s been a hit-or-miss experience, but with the shift to rewards instead of ads, it’s not quite so bad as long as the developer model continues to exist.
There’s also always the matter of making money. Although the company makes money from promoting the app to celebrities, brand endorsement, and in-app purchases, it also makes money from in-app purchases of the app, which is pretty basic to Google Play, where Google earns a little in-app per click.
That’s not a bad thing considering that Twitter is used by so many celebrities, athletes, and news-gathering media organizations for content. That’s part of the reason it’s been able to stay lean, expanding and scaling its business without having to pay much capital expense.
But the company has become so much more than a public social media app in the last few years. Twitter is no longer a small cog in the bowels of one Facebook’s business. The company is now much bigger than the news ecosystem, which doesn’t believe it has anything unique to offer.
As Twitter continues to grow, if it can become a go-to destination for news gathering and news consumption on the web, app developers and content partners will become increasingly valuable to the company as a potential revenue stream outside of the social media space."
"There are plenty of people that still remember the movie Avatar where, for some reason, the main character, called Riley, is suddenly turned into a giant avatar for a malevolent alien, thus becoming the stuff of Avatar-related memes. Now, a new game out of Scotland called Zaoqiao is using the same concept, but with humans! Here’s how it works, as demonstrated for me by co-founder and COO Darcy Stephenson, on show at GDC-Eureka, the European GDC, on January 21 at the event — that is, its first festival in Europe.
The premise of the game is simple. Once you go into a town, you are presented with a cityscape full of characters whose job is to keep humans on the edge of death (think Zaoqiao, for instance). And, of course, there are monsters all the way in — and your guess as to who those monsters are is — but you don’t know the final fate of those people until the battle between Zaoqiao and the evil Makaiju in the game starts.
The idea has been done before, via video games, but the goal

Today, you can’t find a car on the regular market unless it’s rented on the other side of the country, or it can’t be bought from a dealership. Or both. That’s where TheCarConnection hopes to make its network of certified drivers and suppliers work.
For example, if you wanted to rent a new car today, you probably would have to drive to the little Italian town of Castiglia to buy it. But you can take a picture of the car, provide a detailed description, and even call or text (with a credit card, naturally) a licensed driver there.
The company has been growing steadily, adding thousands of car suppliers and users per day, and is now on track to cover the entire country of Italy with its service.
It already has a network of nearly 2,000 “connected” car manufacturers, like Toyota, Audi and BMW, which post their customer satisfaction scores to make sure that their products are top of the heap and fit the customer’s needs. The same could apply to people in the car business, and drivers, where cars delivered from supplier to customer are consistently going where the roads are.
The company works closely with its suppliers and ensures that their products are safe and fit the customer’s needs. Customers that have suffered an accident or other mishap with a supplier can’t find a car on TheCarConnection network, or the consumer can’t find the car they ordered weeks ago because of our own coverage.
However, car repair companies would want to have complete control of when their cars are delivered.
And because it has a network effect, TheCarConnection can also act as a mediator. If your car breaks a window, say, on the inside or rear of it, in the midst of an emergency, you may be able to see if the car can be repaired without needing to call a car repairman or even seeing the car.
However, for car repair shops, delivery and redemption, the risk is that the car would be left in the car until repairs are paid, or the car could simply be put back in the truck and the repairs would be difficult. In this case, TheCarConnection could be more at your back, helping you track down where the car is that you have purchased.
To date, the company says that more than 1,200 customers, many of whom are located in Italy, have rated the service 24/7 — a number that has increased tenfold since last year.
The car owners also include owners in many countries, but because of the limited local knowledge of the country, some have found that it’s difficult to set aside their car for extended periods of time — six months for example.
In Italy, the “Internet of Things” in question are the only companies that can provide this information, so Itelco had been looking to partner with local businesses that could assist drivers with problems.
Through this partnership with a trusted local business, it allowed Itelco to distribute tens of thousands of car repairs kits to customers worldwide, which included consumers in major European countries like the U.K., Germany, France, Netherlands, Italy or Spain. Itelco is also working on a package of additional services to extend the reach of their car repairs and prevent repeat incidents, which has been a problem in the country so far.
In addition, customers don’t have to drive for several years to get service, and because their payments are electronically secured through the service, they aren’t vulnerable to bad sales.
In an effort to continue its growth, as of last year, Itelco is currently acquiring a major competitor, Car Doctor, which sells a similar product in the UK, in addition to Italy and Spain. The combined company will help Itelco expand its local business and reach the largest carmaker market in the U.S. In other words, a combination of big data tech with a little bit of automation (or at least something of that is easy, as they say).
However, while these deals give the combined company a larger, more international user base, Itelco’s international customers now include more than 65 countries and 20,000 technicians and car repairs professionals.
Based on these partnerships, it’s unlikely that TheCarConnection will ever become a “fast-follow” partner for consumers (I don’t do auto repair in Italy) but it may be willing to help accelerate the country’s evolution in the automotive industry with automated cars."
"A number of startups around the world are looking to replicate the U.S. market, and in many cases, the concept of “coaching” — using technology to help sales teams at companies respond to changes in customer behavior. On top of that, new startups are also trying to bring human psychology into the mix from the software front.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 this year, there’s another big change. I’ve been a small investor and now I’m really, really focused on one thing: mobile.”
There are few things a mobile app developer needs today that makes their app stand out in the crowded market so far as it’s worth downloading and using. “It’ll take a great product,” he admits with a tone like half a dozen. “But mobile apps are important for developers because they are a launchpad, they give them the launch on mobile.”.
So with two of the best mobile apps (not counting Snapchat, sadly) in the world today, App Annie is trying to show that it can deliver.
“It’s been an incredible journey. The App Annie team has brought a unique perspective to app analytics,” writes Ross Rosenwah, the founder of App Annie, in a news blog post. “This combination of data from millions of unique mobile users, and our carefully collected data about how that worked, convinced us to enter the app analytics business.”"
"Facebook’s in a curious position. For once, as a platform, it could provide a lot of revenue as a natural, natural thing for itself — and the promise of it, to get users hooked with ads or other forms of commerce — and then the backlash would take a turn and the company would go down. With so much of that revenue coming from mobile products and apps, that was never going to be a rational decision for Facebook. Now, it seems that it can be a rational decision for the company.
The company is today announcing a massive round of funding — not a massive valuation, at least for the current case. It’s a stock deal of $1.2 billion from Accel and other early backers that values the company at $3.5 billion, and the value of that deal has been over $50 billion by appearances.
In a blog post in the run up to the funding announcement, CEO Mark Zuckerberg called the deal an “amazing” deal, with the price being less than the valuation of the company for its last financing round.
Here’s the wording from the post:
And here’s a summary from the blog post:
When I spoke with a couple of Facebook employees today, they told me that the deal had already been leaked. It is, and at a very high level, is a great bet that comes in one of two products. With the one of the biggest companies in the world, the other is huge.
What you have in the deal, and the names of all the executives, are interesting.
It is a pretty clear deal that is a clear way of getting a big company that has built out a business in the area of enterprise products, to do a deal of that size. That company, based out of Dublin, Ireland, was founded in 2008 and has grown to over 1,300 employees from 1,500 at the same time its founders launched a social enterprise product in 2009.
It’s an interesting turn of events in the product world. If you compare it with other similar companies like Oracle, an Oracle deal was an 8% premium on a prior deal, based on similar market caps. In this case Facebook is an 83% to 1,225 person company that has attracted big investment from Oracle, but a significantly smaller company also has big customers like Apple, and a good deal (although not quite that attractive a deal) from Accel at a company worth over $1 billion in a deal that has a lot more flexibility to sell the product, and is the one that the deal has been to work out.
It’s also a big win for the Irish startup ecosystem, giving Facebook a deal not just a deal and the money to take on big-names in its own backyard by offering a business deal at the very heart of the innovation ecosystem.
As far as the enterprise, enterprise and mobile products are concerned there are not very many companies that offer more in terms of breadth than Facebook and Amazon. (One sign of a shift by one company to offer a suite or services across platforms across several platforms, though, is that in the last 18 months it has doubled its number of enterprise customers to over 400,000.)
It’s also a deal that Facebook is making, and one that gives it a lot of credibility to work like a solid enterprise competitor to enterprise businesses that want a big data play. To this effect, it will need to attract enterprise companies and deal buyers that it can do. Facebook currently owns around 40,000 companies in 100 countries, and has been aggressively investing in what it believes are going to be the next billion-dollar markets for mobile and enterprise services around

 tremate to that extent which makes a sound that was previously silent something like a rain whistle. No rain, no snow, just a sound like a crashing wave, yet.
A few weeks later, a team of three young women from San Francisco, the team behind “The New Balloons,” an award-winning sketch comedy series on ABC, are now working on an app platform with this sort of sound. And so no surprise that they’re now backed by a well-known label.
Soundrop has made its official debut at Disrupt SF’s Demo Stage, and can be found here.

"At Disrupt SF today, Foursquare co-founder and CEO Garrett Camp began by showing a live demo of the upcoming Android and iOS apps. The company just launched its API for Android smartphones and its App Center. The app centers are part app center, part social networking. When you press on the app center, you will be prompted to open the app center and browse your friends’ profiles.
“We want you to feel like there’s something happening,” Camp said. “And we want to be a sort of network.”
When you start interacting with the app center, you will see your friends in the front row of the stage — you don’t even need to open the app center.
Then, you can invite friends to the app center, share their profile on the app center, or follow someone’s profile. You can import your checkins from Facebook, import your checkins from iTunes, or import your location from Google Maps. More importantly, you can browse and see everything the friends are sharing publicly on the main screen.
“One of the most important aspects of the app center now,” Camp said, “we have a social fabric that’s going to weave together a lot of different things, a lot like you’re able to get music and news from an app center, a kind of thing like AirPlay lets you connect through your phone, by the app center, but it really allows you to tune into something — you can have a lot of apps integrated together to support them as well.”
It looks and acts a lot like AirPlay, except that you don’t have to have the app center — just like you’ve got an HDMI port and a mini keyboard, you can import music from iTunes.
And it’s really easy to add your favorite podcast, music from Spotify, Amazon’s AMPLIFis, SoundCloud, or Deezer.
The new Android and iOS apps are only the tip of the iceberg over the coming platform update. Over the coming weeks, Android users will have access to more powerful functions such as sharing your favorite tracks, saving tracks, and accessing the Android application directly through the app center.
Then, there’s going to be a developer-focused competition to create an app center around the major social networks. The winner could get access to Google Maps, Twitter and Google+ circles.
As expected, Google’s Android team gave the demo to a select group (Android Central, The New York Times, BuzzFeed, and CrunchBase). After showing the live app and the new Android app center, Google’s Android head Vic Gundo joked by saying that he was the winner. However, he later added that the company wouldn’t be the sole winner. Other Google Android teams were also able to hack together a real air-ship that took advantage of Google+, Foursquare, or Instagram’s APIs.
“We won despite Google being second,” Google’s head Vic Gundo joked onstage. It’s unclear if the company doesn’t really believe that a real user would open the app center right now. A small team of one, the rest of Google. It’s not clear if the new Android experience is just the front end of the new Google+ and invite your friends.
At the end of the night, Google’s CEO Larry Page was too enthusiastic about the Google+ “platform” and the API. The main focus of the show should be less product announcement and more social sharing. Google already launched a demo of a new collaboration feature in the first Google+ app, and later released the most popular Chrome Browser. Google+ users will be able to invite a bunch of their friends on the platform for a more seamless sharing experience.

Update: Google clarified the launch date and said that “experimenters” will be given access to the new Android and iOS apps. It doesn’t seem like Google’s product team has yet to be there. While the app center is now open

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Yi , this is how they explain it:
And that’s the way it should work.
It’s a big ask for a financial services company to make waves — the financial services sector currently sits on some $2.5 trillion in unused capacity. The only bank that can possibly show that it can make sense of that is the U.K.’s NatBank, which is a major player in the world’s first “pay-as-you-go” banking.
All three of Natbank’s customers, currently at Natbank, are of course small businesses who are likely to need the smallest amount of technical support to get an upstart up-and-running. The Natbank co-founders know this all too well; after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania and becoming bank regulars themselves, they built a one-page app that let you manage your money and pay cash management. Natbank’s customer base of more than 100,000 customers includes a number of larger companies.
That’s probably a testament to the power of a true one-page app. The Natbank team made sure that the app’s UI was as minimalistic as possible to as much as possible. A single feature request included offering the ability to add a number of additional services so that the app could cover more of your routine. While Natbank charges a set flat $79 per month fee, it’s a tiny fraction of the fees that other online money services like Dwolla or PayPal pay, and I wouldn’t hold my breath that these three companies are going to fold soon. Natbank is clearly on a good footing right now, and the team should be able to release a few more features over the next few months to try to grow the overall user base."
"A startup that has built a secure and reliable mail communications technology, Mailbox, just announced that it has raised $8 million in a Series D round of venture funding.
Mailbox was co-founded in 2009 by New York-based serial technology entrepreneur and software expert Andrew Tracy. The idea, he told me, was to introduce a “digital, secure, self-destructing email” and to make that happen on mobile. In addition to its email technology, the company also offers an iPhone and Android app.
The company has since grown to a team of 50, now including co-founders Andrew Cooper, who worked on email technologies at Yahoo; Alan Duraban, the former CTO of McAfee; and Scott Raymond, who previously worked on the Gmail user interface at Mailbox.
Mailbox actually raised a small round of seed funding earlier this year, but Tracy said that the biggest demand brought in by that round was around $5 million (in part because Mailbox didn’t want to make the tough decision to expand internationally). Today’s funding announcement was actually a little over that, with Andreessen Horowitz leading the round.
Tracy argued that this amounts to Mailbox taking what it learned “across the board and applying it to a bigger opportunity.” For example, email is a notoriously fragile and insecure medium.
In early 2013, the team began collaborating to try to make email messages more secure, an essential goal the team says. The two then teamed up on Mailbox, building native tools that would give users a Gmail mail-hosting experience, a pretty amazing one-click unsubmerging email and even better, mark a message as read.
Mailbox’s iOS and Android apps have since become the top-based clients for the company, and over the last year have been downloaded over 15 million times. In addition to the app downloads, Mailbox has also grown to serve over 1 billion read-it-later secrets, and one billion messages have been sent.
The startup is working on more of these new features, such as secure cloud storage and secure payments, and plans to continue that track. But Mailbox’s big picture goal remains the same: “Protecting the open, working internet,” Tracy said on an earlier call.
Mailbox is available for both iPhone and Android, but only for the time being. Tracy also noted that the company plans to release iOS and web apps soon after, with native apps to follow at a later point."
"Mobile advertising startup Namo Media has raised £1 million (approx. $1.5 million) in fresh funding: the new round was led by the Abu Dhabi-based private venture capital unit of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and U.S./German publisher of tech/startup hybrids Fusible. German publisher of Web users Metosoft is also joining the list, having previously announced its Namo Media investment.
Namo Media claims it is on a mission to bring in a new generation of publishers on the desktop, who are looking to move away

 an official account that gives you a lot of information about the service and its goal. And today, the service is opening up a new way with the addition of integrations.
The company, which was founded six years ago in Tel Aviv and was still operating out of its original offices in New York, got its start with a location-based mobile service of its own, letting you stay in contact with loved ones by sending special messages via Bluetooth. But the company has been growing more slowly. Today, the company now has over 15 million users in total, with around half of those users using its web and mobile apps on a daily basis.
Though there is no way to trace the individual users to determine where in the world they are on the app, it’s possible to see how the app may be used as kind of “find my friends” function, too. And it could be an interesting way to introduce new users into the app, who are often more interested in communication and social than a pure messaging app.
The app has a freemium model where free accounts are available with up to five contacts. These can be managed with a family member, so that you can get those important phone numbers, but it’s also possible to give out calls and text messages to your loved ones for a nominal fee. This is of course still subject to the social network’s strict 100+ degree privacy policy."
"Google has announced two fairly unique Android-powered streaming music companies — Deezer and Rdio — which will work on top of each other to power all your song-sharing needs.
The UK startup, whose official launch was earlier this year, is already in some 40 languages in the world, but the feature that will work with the newly launched Deezer service is the ability to link a user to local music from their Rdio and Deezer-powered playlists.
“We are working on combining the strengths of these two companies to put music first on the smartphone and then on our player,” said David Porter, who, alongside his father, started the idea for the company.

The pair have been working hard to bring the product a step closer to being “discoverable”, Porter told me during a call.
For those who were curious, the two companies are actually rebranding from the start, to avoid any potential confusion from the start by mimicking the names.
“We’ve had a name change, and we changed the logos and we launched in Spain, but we’re trying to stick to the same brand,” Porter explained.

To date, Deezer has seen over 70,000 million song plays worldwide and it hopes to reach 1.8 million by the end of 2016. Both companies are competing in the space of streaming music, with the two big players at the height of their respective growth, with Spotify taking 70% in the U.S., and Deezer at around 55% in Europe and Brazil, according to Kantar Worldpanel.
Deezer’s main competitor is also a podcast streaming startup called Beezer that it launched in February of this year.
After a free beta test in February and a subsequent public launch in September with just over 700,000 users and roughly 12,000 on its own, Deezer quietly made the switch to a paid service in October. A paid account charges between €4.99 and €9.90 per month.
“We want to help people find new music through our app and our offline, online and online station and catalog,” Deezer CEO Rami Belaire told me. “We are focusing on offering full services and tools for our users with Deezer. The offline part is mainly in the background.”
But the company is also talking up the global reach the new service will offer, which will enable users to search and download tracks from around 2,000 top artists on the platform, plus over 1,500 others according to the company.
When I first covered Deezer a year ago with its plans to democratise the music experience for smartphone users, the company promised it wouldn’t change its business model, but that would include not offering any sort of ads — something that Belaire says is the company’s main bread and butter, with the offline feature aimed at bringing a little more transparency to the music industry.
He also says Deezer will continue to expand into new territories this year, but on a gradual basis. It could potentially take some of these new territories more slowly, as Deezer continues to grow its user base amongst music industry players.
The company also continues to put the finishing touches on its new R and D offices. These situate Deezer closer to being a global player, rather than simply another player in the space like Apple

 knew only a tiny percentage of users were taking a photo, and it was getting worse over the course of the months leading up to the app’s launch.
In its last iteration, the app was focused on sharing pictures with people you already knew, the company explained. But over time, it’s been made more “social” and social networking platform, and even in private, Facebook-style messaging, and it has steadily grown to up to 50,000 new users per month.
One recent addition is a “Nearby” feature. With the Facebook app, you can now share any photo you see in Facebook. However, unlike Yahoo’s old “Inboxer” feature which lets users add notes to any photo stored on their photo library, Facebook users can post their own images. There are also more “trends” and “topic areas.”
While this system has been well-built, the service itself has something of an oddity around the design of many of its newer features, which can be difficult to read. They’re sometimes difficult to scroll through, making the product a bit less difficult to grasp than the Twitter for iOS app, which makes it less of practical utility.
As we get to the app to view the images, it becomes harder to read their small preview versions when compared to the full-sized version, which is both frustrating and awkward.
If you want the photo in full-size, the download is available on Google Play, and you can download it by navigating to the right part of a photo for free."
"...In between his run on the Obama for America presidential ticket and a stint as an investment banker, Mike Hirshland joined Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Sharks Fund, a $500,000 fund led by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.
It’s a $50,000 investment in every three months without any strings attached. According to the company Facebook’s plan is for the investments to last about four years within the first two years of the fund, though it might be a slightly longer period than that.
It is the second investment in a Sharks fund following the fund’s launch in January. And the first of more. The new one was in January for a $40 million fund.
This Sharks fund is currently expanding, and its second big investment will be taking equity from its early-stage firms and putting them on the line for additional investment.
Before the fund launched, Facebook would do a fundraising campaign in July and then wait for the first three months before committing to it. “It was kind of messy – it wasn’t easy for the investors to commit,” Hirshland says. Facebook’s growth made the latter decision a bit more complicated.
Instead of giving shares from their common ownership and holding them in escrow, Facebook’s “investor pool” consisted of only some of its top angels. That’s something that made it hard to make a commitment while waiting for the fund’s funds to clear, which is what the Sharks fund allows, and that’s a key decision in the development of any Shark fund.
But it also means that while the partners inside the fund that invest in the fund are independent from its fund, there’s a lot of accountability. So it sometimes makes for a situation where insiders have an advantage in being able to push and influence companies they believe in and without having to sell equity in the fund.
Another drawback of the platform (although it benefits from being able to access the “same” investor pools that Wall Street has with institutional investors) is the lack of connection to the fund itself. That means a Facebook user looking for a company to invest in can just browse the Sharks fund in hopes of finding a partner with knowledge of the same company, but that hasn’t stopped a number of startups from doing just that.
Facebook is offering a much more broad-ranging portfolio with the Sharks fund. “It’ll be open to startups that are backed by TechStars, backed by Y Combinator, backed by 500 Startups, backed by Andreessen Horowitz, backed by Kleiner Perkins and more,” says Hirshland.
One reason the Sharks fund is focusing on more diverse investors is that the company’s founders have been active in the industry through the nonprofit Impact Engine.org. “They get great value from these relationships [they had] where they’ll consult in the right areas with the right experts,” says Hirshland. “And since Impact Engine has a good track record on Wall Street, they’ll be a very valuable resource for a company’s fundraising and investment efforts.”
The new, deeper investment comes in the form of

 Internet to get things done, and they would like to see it end up being an app that can get things done at scale.”
If anything, the big challenge is that this is a hard problem to solve. There isn’t a “silver bullet” here that hashed together all the pieces of a great consumer experience, but in the world of mobile payments, it’s an important part of the business even if the rest is secondary. The main revenue sources will still be people using their phones to make payments, and paying bills and tipping with their friends. But the problem is all those other small, secondary services that people are using to make payments for stuff that isn’t bolted on.
So how do you solve that? I’m not going to lay out how to get to that milestone, since it just isn’t fun of anyone working on it.
First, though, I’d like to lay out one thing: you need someone to come up with all that business and product vision. I’ll call that a “silver bullet,” but a “big idea” is better than half the business that it will be. So when it comes to that big idea, I think it could be a combination of things: getting a big-brand-recognized name to sign on, getting people, via their friends, to sign up — which will happen very fast — then the company starts to make things, as the old saying goes, just go faster,
It’s going to be a two-way street, but if both parties are there and committed, then perhaps you can take on that big idea and turn it into the first “true” business.

"You may have heard of social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, for getting users to post updates about what they’re seeing, sharing and liking. But a new startup, Blip.ly, is launching to solve another use case: sharing photos in an app.
You can upload anything, whether that’s links to a brand’s website on your phone through an app, an image the company describes as a “photo tweet,” a photo or video message that’s meant to be shared with friends later on, or even text messages that are meant to be saved in a contact card, or even a photo the person sending the message to you. Any of those types of messages can be shared out to social networks and also consumed from within Blip.ly’s app.
Since the earliest days of email, we’ve been noticing the trend of “sharing to Twitter,” even “blips” appearing in that user’s timeline. That trend, which we’re seeing more and more of these days, is not necessarily a bad thing; after all, it is the extension of social networks that have given rise to the phenomenon of “dank” – meaning – a social network or an email (or webmail, for that matter). But it, again, isn’t necessarily a bad thing when it comes to new applications for messaging.
The idea with Blip.ly, unlike a number of apps that are on a similar trend, is that the content that’s shared with Facebook through a mobile application, for example, is not only restricted to Facebook itself. It’s also not a bad thing – it’s the foundation of an emerging social network. The folks at Blip.ly are keen to work with other companies to build out their own platform, though they won’t disclose further information, unless it’s in the public domain. (Blip.ly is not a Twitter property, it is a web service built on top of Twitter.) But there may be others interested in the same idea.
In addition, Blip.ly is a Twitter-like service and is not just limited to that one specific platform. So, for those users, Blip.ly opens up a potential network of “microsites,” as these microsites are called, which could then be shared with their friends and family. (There are also mobile apps for iOS and Android that allow users to view and save these microsite messages, as well as web versions of the service.)
With the advent of the mobile Web, the need for digital-like, “bite-sized” microsites is growing. But as a microsite (or microsite) is a microsite with metadata about who created it, what content it’s being shared, a section for a given topic, and so on, there’s space within a microsite for content to carry multiple interpretations and perspectives

 conversations, which, as noted above, are only able to bring “an online audience of 15 million+ users.”
What was the startup’s other key differentiator? In today’s wireless environment, while Google and Facebook are both working on tying together, there is an ongoing social component to the process.
“I thought we can do that in a different way — by talking to the masses, if you like people, how do you talk to people? How can you reach them and say what’s not working, so they give you ideas. I thought it will be exciting because… this is what we’ve done. And we will be interesting in making these decisions. We think there’s nothing wrong in giving a social network first to consumers on a mobile device, on a device which is increasingly mobile,” he says, giving himself the benefit of being able to push these messages more effectively to target users in emerging markets.
“What did we do? We have a social media expert. For example, we wanted a guy from the West Coast who has spent time with you — so really, you know, you go to a West Coast bar and you’re sitting next to this big screen. You’re on the other side of the screen. How do you get that group to get out of that?”
“We want to have the power to send them a message,” he adds. “We think it’s a social call to action — to get that group to want to go somewhere… We don’t think mobile is good enough.”
The company says it has been making some strategic acquisitions to bolster its R&D efforts in areas like artificial intelligence, machine learning and language understanding, for example. That’s what the first announcement will be, says Choudhury, with the aim of continuing building out the business globally.
The news of the round was announced earlier this week during the World Economic Forum in Davos.
As for where Molyneux is heading next to business — the company has been in operation since the middle of 2013 but in early 2015 he’s being appointed Governor of The University of Nevada, Chaldos — Choudhury says that’s for when he first moves over to the TechStars, but he declined to say who or why.
“I’ll first need to ask Molyneux to tell me what he actually liked to be in the future… He won’t tell as much, he wanted to tell the story,” he says. “This is about the future, about creating something, the next big social network, the next Facebook or the next Facebook and the next big business” (to better explain). “We thought of him as a leader, saying ‘I can turn this around in my time,’ and we thought he needed to step aside to do a bit of work himself to do that.”
Molyneux, he says, had already started the process but at the moment there is a question mark over whether Molyneux will be taking over at a public company or DST as the Chairman of Molyneux’s next employer (if it’s to go public, it needs to make at least $50 million in revenue on a $500m revenue basis as that’s the metric under consideration).
(The company has to be around for the next 10 to 15 years, and Molyneux has promised he will be in charge of it within six years — the last company he was in charge of is now being acquired and Molyneux taking over at an event of that length is not happening yet.)
While Molyneux’s position as the figure head of Molyneux’s new business will not extend beyond Molyneux himself as Molyneux goes forward as CEO, Molyneux is staying in the CEO’s chair for another reason — the company is now being run by Molyneux’s Chairman for Life, which will be the “sister” company for the rest of Molyneux’s 10 year-old company  Molyneux.
Molyneux’s position at Molyneux is becoming as clear and obvious as his name is now, with Molyneux taking care of all things related to the company.
Molyneux’s appointment as Chairman of Molyneux, who he’s been in charge of since 2011 (which, as we’ve pointed out, he’s still getting to go), is a change from his position at Apple — Apple which Molyneux bought from Apple for over $1 billion — but it’s M

 called and their customers will give them the information they need to launch the product and sell it.”
So far, he notes, customers using Hootsuite have seen “huge results.”
While there are a number of other social media management providers out there, with Twitter Fire and Instagram for more marketing, Bizzabo says that his differentiator is the fact of its being “social,” and therefore more open. And in the future, he says he sees no barrier to people using more social features — “The idea is around making it socially possible for people.”"
"After launching a new version of its website for the first time on Tuesday, the new version of WordPerfect has just hit the home page, displaying a more comprehensive listing of all of their online properties.
However, most users will likely just be able to see a single page that has features like the domain, business name (their company, not their company, but of course, or whatever), and more. And in fact, the pages aren’t all that different. WordPerfect is a website, not a product, of course, so it’s not all about what you want to do with an online business.
The site launched a little over a year ago, and CEO Matthew Pastel said the original idea came from his experience at the company.
Pastel said, “WordPerfect’s early push into the business world has helped a company of 4 million users find success at a time when others were falling by the wayside. We see the same role here: A single company can change the world,” he said. “WordPerfect is a place where people can go to start a career, start their career with WordPerfect, and make it more effective for a user to use all the tools we built to improve the overall word perfection experience as well.”
The new version has a revamped home page, allowing users to find the right type of business, type of issue (e.g. tech vs. health) and the right person/place to get a particular tip, search their past experiences and go through individual pieces of advice.
The app also includes an activity feed and analytics for a variety of things.
For example, people may go onto WordPerfect.com to look at what’s going on with health, in particular, and see who’s done it best.
It’s a fascinating concept, and a fairly simple idea. But once you see it, and think about what it means to empower users, it’s obviously compelling.
With a large body of people and platforms, it’s possible to see even larger opportunities, like the social platform for things like health and fitness. However, it’s probably going to be a crowded space (and an uphill battle) over time. 
On the other hand, you’ve likely been watching Pinterest for years now, and the company’s potential to the world is growing all the time. The site will be updated in the future (it’s a great place to find great stuff), but the general focus will remain on helping people find the right product that actually helps them — if that’s the right call.

"I don’t always play social games, but when I do, I like them quite a bit more. Like, I actually have some friends over that I’ve connected with through Facebook on Facebook. And just yesterday, they started getting really good at games. They’re like people: they go to Facebook and they find that you don’t get enough friends. So they start asking us where they can put their social graph.
When I came to my apartment with my friends, I looked at the address in my Facebook profile. It was right next to City Hall. “This is my place where I live right now,” it reads. I was so enamored with their play, and the fact that you had just shared something like their post, and was like, “oh, I was about to be the person that came up with a good idea.”
After that, they put their phone in a drawer and then started texting me like other people they knew I had, but they said, “Can I invite you over to play some games?”. So I said, “OK.’
Then I said, “Well, I’m going to try it.” And after a brief conversation, we got to play a Flappy Bird game together.
We were in the same office. We used to play the same games together, including ones where we had one more guy on the team come by, and I was in charge of turning the whole thing. We were a funny lot. We would joke about it a lot. “The office is

 say it now has over 90 million registered users — up from 70 million in September last year.
And just in time for SXSW, the company says the photos are updated hourly to keep up with the various activities in the schedule — from buying tickets and attending events — along with social sharing features tailored specifically to Facebook and Twitter. (More, below, in the video).

The company has raised just over $37 million from investors — which include Mayfield Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Khosla Ventures, and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers).
It’s a bit startling to see how much it costs to figure out in just a few months (so far, it has raised $42 million), but it’s not like it’s been abandoned entirely. We still are, after all, talking about the future of the company, how you deal with change, and what it means for all of us.
Some of us seem to agree with the view that it makes sense to change in time to deal with the changes (as I’ve written in the past), but there is also a lot of negativity that the service has been unable to bridge the gap between the shift in consumer behavior and the shift in the enterprise world — and while there are certainly a lot of successful services serving this gap at the moment, it’s not always that easy to find new users. And most of the time, it’s been because of the tackling of a larger organization that is trying to make changes and try to make the experience more like what people expect.
“As an entrepreneur, business decisions are always complicated, and it is not always consistent with the path you are supposed to take,” a YC alumna wrote in a post yesterday called “The Startup Life Cycle And The YC Startup Transition.” In a way, she was describing the “change that’s necessary as an entrepreneur or a VC to start a profitable business.”
One thing that appears to be a part of the transition is a growing recognition that the old YC style of entrepreneurialism isn’t for a changing world, and that the new YC culture is more diverse, less dense and more nuanced. That includes allowing for women to be co-investors, as well as a whole lot of different ethnicities, religions, ethnicities and more. That diversity, said YC itself, is something that has allowed it to attract diverse and more diverse entrepreneurs.
That is also helped along by the fact that YC has invested more than $3 million in the last year in startups from over 40 different countries, where at least half of the startups it invests in are international and/or based outside of the U.S., the company says.
“This is a global investment,” added YC’s Graham Weston, when asked for more details about how the fund invests in startups today. “We operate in the United States and have investments throughout the world. We found that many entrepreneurs we invest in and work with around the world. This is an important global and global opportunity because the best way to position and reach entrepreneurs and early adopters is through trial and error trials, because these decisions (and companies that are driving their adoption) don’t always have to be made by VCs. The best way to know what products and services best suit the best entrepreneurs is through observing the business.” There’s a lot there, but only if you know where your competitors are.
You can also find the funding data that YC provides here. It focuses on the period between the year when it first announced its new accelerator program and how that program is doing in terms of how many applicants it admits. It also provides general information about its active applicants over time, but it is limited to its latest figure for the accelerator period.
The most interesting data point about YC’s new program is the average accepted increase (in percentage of applicants) that it finds to the years prior to the program.
What this data really shows, to me at least, is that even if startups that are very far along in their lifecycle are working with mentors, and are not in the luxury of moving to other kinds of services, they can still benefit from YC’s model.

At the time of writing, the site itself hosts 15,000 “Loves” across its network, with some 15 million impressions of them made each day, the company note.
The move underscores a time of growth for the online ad startup, as ITPro has grown up in emergency situations (like scarlock raids and bombings) and the need to protect business.
ITPro is not alone. It competes there with Google and Facebook, although while those are not actively trying to compete, there are nonetheless some similarities between all three of them — including the need to make better use of the information and data inside its systems.
What’s more, the more it can scale a better network, the more people will click on those ads, the more ITPro can serve them as attractive, and the better it can compete for the more business.
In that regard, the potential for ITPro in this new version of IT security makes a lot of sense. “This is a way to make data truly secure to boot,” said Atsen Horowitz partner Doug Cutting, in an interview. “The way the data in here is encrypted, so it doesn’t look like anything out of ‘the bad stuff’.”
ITPro is also announcing a new feature called Hashes, which will make it easier for people to protect passwords from being stolen in other ways. In my previous post, I talked about hashes (which I called “smart passwords”).
The concept is that IT admins and security experts can share passwords they are using multiple times at once — rather than simplifying those passwords on multiple platforms across multiple sites. “Smart stuff” in the form of passwords that are easy to steal and reuse are the kind of security mechanism that ITPro may see here, too. It also says it will soon introduce a new tool, designed for security experts and admins to make even stronger passwords available by way of a new “hashed password tree.”
It’s not clear whether there will be further integrations between ITPro and other big security players like Microsoft, IBM and the ever-popular Bit.ly that threaten to make things worse; of course there will be.
ITPro, like its name implies, provides some user management features. That is, it gives you visibility of how your users are using your network. You can, for example, you can look at them using “view dashboard” on your desktop. It also offers an interesting view of who is accessing your network and who they are not at all using you.

This, obviously, provides an interesting angle and it also gives IT pros and admins the ability to better control how their tools work.
Another feature is a monitoring service that lets you see how your infrastructure is performing. This too is built on top of analytics that provides clues and insight into what is going wrong, like a malfunction in your server hardware.
This is a feature that points out how IT comes together: it’s the next iteration of the IT automation model, after first introducing in November 2015 the concept of an “I/O device on a network” which is supposed to do things like monitor network, system, network device and other things — so that it can automatically fix problems and give infrastructures insurance payments. “We’re at a point where we can make tools that connect to that new model and use that new kind of analytics behind that,” notes Shashwat.
What’s new here is a way to deploy these monitoring services across multiple different infrastructure services. “This is a way to deploy them across containers,” says Shashwat, noting that each container can have a customized security profile.

As part of this rollout, IT pros will be able to choose and deploy these tools by way of a Windows Azure portal. “There are lots of interesting applications that are available on this platform,” says Shashwat, highlighting that they can range from security compliance to cloud security to business intelligence.
Another new piece is the ability for security professionals to share threat models with other security experts and customers. “Imagine this if someone were thinking of the product — such as a penetration consultant. They can quickly share a threat model with a penetration analyst using tools such as Microsoft Azure with ease.”
The combination of security features and the way they integrate makes the overall security product more cohesive and effective, says Shashwat, who notes that the company’s approach can make the overall product more relevant, both in the enterprise, but also for  individuals. That means IT pros and security guys from different departments with varying

 20-12, but in the last year or two, Apple has also been leading among Android OEMs in terms of smartphone shipments. Samsung’s Galaxy Tab and its slightly- smaller Galaxy Note range are currently the number one and two mobile device makers, respectively.
Microsoft currently leads in hardware, with HTC the other notable OEM. HTC’s two remaining OEMs have either dropped off Android support entirely or been relegated to becoming Android resellers.
The Samsung experience, however, is far from rosy. According to a new report from the Gigaom Group, Samsung lost out on smartphone shipments for the first time since 2009. According to the analysis center, Samsung shipped 6.5 million units in 2012, out of a total 10.6 million units sold.
Here’s how that breakdown breaks down:
Samsung has still managed to remain in the lead despite its Android drop. Android accounted for 26.9 million units in 2012, but that was a decline of 3 million from 2012 for Samsung. Samsung shipped 5.2 million units in 2013, a decline of 1.3 million units. Meanwhile, LG shipped 1.7 million units in 2013, with its Optimus G Pro model.
The G Pro is rumored to have a spec that makes it even more useful than its smaller brother, which only offers a 2.0-inch display, but not Android. While Samsung has continued to reign supreme with its mobile efforts, LG’s shipments plummeted this year as LG’s Optimus G Pro, and its other models struggled, growing just under 1 million units in total.

Apple and Google are the main contenders for the global smartphone throne, and Apple’s iPad line of tablets is pushing ahead of its Apple TV, even with its slight-to-more-niche bump. With a projected total global installed base of 70 million, and growing unit shipments of up to 26 million, it’s only a matter of time before Apple surpasses Google’s total of 72 million smartphone devices.

[via The Next Web]"
"Google is announcing two big new mobile products today — a $35 Nexus 4 tablet and a $10 Google Pixel C smartphone. But Android still reigns supreme in the tablet market, and that’s by design, according to the companies.
The Nexus 4, announced on stage at MWC, is a 12.3-inch Android slate that comes with a NVIDIA Tegra K1 processor and will be called the Nexus. The company says it will sell for $429 when it goes on sale in the fall. The device is the first tablet from Google after its acquisition of YouTube last year, and the one that Google still calls its “main” Android smartphone. It will be available initially in the “low-end” 512MB version, with more options coming soon. Like the $32 Nexus 5, the tablet will also come with a $50 in Play credit.
The Pixel, announced onstage today at MWC, is Google’s newest in-house Android smartphone. Like its sibling, it’s a $399 device (though this is a direct discount from the $649 Nexus 5). But unlike its slightly-cheap sibling, it too lacks Google’s Chromecast technology — a feature that had previously been rumored to be a Google acquisition. But Google maintains that it will develop Chromecast-specific software, and that it will bring the same type of streaming capabilities to its Android tablets.
The Google Pixel C, announced this past week at MWC, is Google’s newest in-house Android tablet. Like its cheaper brother, the Pixel C is designed for consumers for the Google-branded version of Android. Users will be able to choose between eight apps, including YouTube, YouTube Music and Google’s Gmail and Drive apps, and while the company will continue to churn out Android tablets, as it has done with the Nexus line, it will with the Pixel C.
Google’s tablet line has continued to grow steadily as a result of its increased involvement in the mobile hardware mix, but the question is whether Google will continue to follow through the years-long tradition of producing Android tablets that match the quality of Apple’s iPad, which hit the market with its original iPad mini in 2011. That’s to say, Google will probably continue to market the Nexus 4, which has been very popular among Android device enthusiasts and the press, even though the company has ceased publicly discussing the subject. Users may have been hoping to get one in the wild and braggadocious Google Play Edition hardware, but Google won’t be bringing that device to market with the Pixel C on a retail basis."
"Last year, Gobi Partners and Accel led a $50 million round in app discovery platform, Flappy Bird. Today, with new funding being announced, the company is announcing a multi-billion dollar round, led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from existing investors

 area to work. While the tech on Gear has generally been viewed as niche, if anything, that’s changing, as not everyone is quite sure yet whether wearable computing is something that can significantly or significantly increase their usage. We’d love to hear your take on why.
The other question to mull over here is whether Android Wear and its successor, Android Auto, are going to succeed.
Like the rest of wearable computing, Android Wear works the best when paired with a mobile phone application. Auto, if you’ve recently upgraded to the LG G Watch, is fantastic, as it shows you notifications about things on your home screen that you actually care about, like a new message, or a new email.
Wear, on the other hand, is more of something that you plug into your life, a fashion accessory, or even maybe a fashion accessory that’s something you actually get yourself. It’s not something I typically use but I like this watch and the leather strap.
What’s it like?
While most have praised Google and its Google Glass project for a few key reasons, one of those was that it solved one of the most basic problems associated with wearables: getting one of them to actually work.
Before Glass, if you wanted to put one of your items on a magnetic charger pad and remove it, you’d either have to buy a bunch of charging pads, or you’d have to dig the charging pad out of some other place to plug one of your items. That’s obviously not ideal, and it’s something that you only occasionally have to charge, if ever. And while most of us never thoughtlessly charged our cell phones when taking them with us around ourselves, even the simplest chargers have relatively long lifespans, whether you buy a Pad or not.
With Glass, you simply slide your phone or tablet under your palm, and that’s it, your mobile charger pad. With Android Wear and the LG G Watch, the process was different yet again — the phone would detect that you were plugging the device into an USB pad, and would show you notifications about the battery level (upcoming notifications!) as well as a new payment option.
In short, it worked like you’d expect — notifications, no more, because this was a “chipsetter.” Not “dumb”, but “nice”. And like Google is wont to say, it worked so well that in fact it became a household app.
But is this the end of the mobile charger? We’ve already seen reports that suggest Wear has fallen behind Bluetooth when it comes to activity tracking, but if this is turning out to be a real issue, rather than a choice for early adopters, I think that we’ll look to the Play Store to find out.
If it does become a big issue, though, and it’s really just a short-term fix, perhaps we won’t see much of it. At least, that’s the way I feel; I’m not so sure that’s going to be the case. I see the LG G Watch as being a showcase device, and it would be interesting to see how the market reacts to the change."
"Apple has a new patent issued by the USPTO (via AppleInsider) that could make it easier and more effective to unlock a device and remove sensitive data in a future iPhone upgrade. The company wants to work around Apple’s Touch ID sensor, which has been the subject of various leaks over the course of 2013 and 2014, to allow for a more secure element to be added to the unlocking process.
Using Touch ID in this case could unlock the new iPhone faster and more securely, since it wouldn’t have to rely on a passphrase, while the fingerprint used would be less likely to fail and, thanks to the fingerprint-based protection that would offer up additional security than an unlocked phone, if hackers were able to obtain and compromise the device. The fingerprint-based protection was what effectively made Touch ID secure, according to Apple’s patent, not some kind of “identate finger print authentication” system.
The fingerprint authentication for Touch ID is used in the patent, which could open up its use to third-party developers, since it provides Apple with more unique data about an individual’s identity during the authentication process, including things like name, email, phone number and place of the phone (if the phone has been compromised, Touch ID could be compromised too, but just for the most part.)
It’s still an interesting path for Apple to explore, however, since it could improve the security of its mobile hardware, and provides an extra layer of protection that would’ve otherwise used by the company for other problems. In practice, it’s not unlikely to be the

ights and more.
The service will continue to sell itself on Amazon’s KKR marketplaces, including Amazon Web Services, as well as through its own channels. The company says that more than 25 million devices have launched with the Kindle Fire tablets to date, out of 7 billion total Android devices (including new ones).
But the Kindle Fire is clearly still the “back-up” phone of the current ecosystem and, in spite of Amazon’s efforts in the higher end and more niche markets, KKR is already looking to diversify beyond smartphones and into more personal devices.
In a recent report, KKR says IDC predicts the U.S. will account for $1.1 billion in tablets in 2014 based on Samsung, and that it will remain ‘top of the heap’ this year, behind the iPad, which KKR already has some 4th of the top of the value for.
As with Amazon’s international growth, KKR sees the Amazon Kindle Fire as a potential weapon to extend further into areas where it already has strong growth to sell services and apps. “We are already on track to beat 2013 in tablet shipments and will exceed 2014 by mid-2014 based on sales.” It notes that the Kindle Fire is “definitely the brand smartphone, right now” — an important point: it’s not something that people are trying to push as the “anti-tablet device”.
KKR currently has some 17 million devices in its portfolio, and KKR CEO Tim Koppel told me that this will be a key area of growth going forward: that’s where the Kindle Fire could have been positioned last year, but with its $100 price tag and limited feature set, the iPad was a very different device. And it seems likely that the iPhone is playing a bit of a role there. Koppel told me that KKR would “love to partner” with Apple in India, the target for its next step up the smartphone game."
"You can’t swing a bag of cats without hitting the new iPhone 5c. There are few other things out there that would seem ridiculous to me, but the one I’ve seen and embedded in my review of the iPhone 5c is a real story down from a smartphone salesman — who’s actually convinced me there is demand for this new handset!
To be fair, the 5c still seems rather chirpy, with a 4 inch (or 5inch, not 3 inch) screen running at 1.5GHz, and a dual-tone metal chassis for the back. The one you see is a plastic-bodied plastic iPhone 5c, and I only expect to see more plastic hardware from the iPhone in general. As an iPhone user and lover of the iPod nano, I didn’t love the 5s with this hardware.
But there is something missing. And it’s the camera.
There’s a camera on the back of the iPhone 5c that you can actually see on your eye and actually use without changing the image you get from the lens. It works surprisingly well for video calls, but also is good for stills (i.e. animations).
The 5s camera is fairly large, and is far from the sharp angles you’ll have on a camera at the start of the iPhone 5c’s OS transition. And it does offer a bit more image clarity out of the box, too.
Most of the image processing happens in the camera, not at all moving pixels or pixels moving around. But most of the time your image will be the same amount of viewable screen. That means images will be very brief and you will be holding the phone, which won’t be particularly true of the 5s.
As with the other changes you’ll see on iOS, the 5s is the real deal, just as it is with most of Apple’s hardware changes. It’s a very different kind of phone — a larger screen with better cameras, better imaging, better text, notifications, or anything else.
Which is what we’re finding with the 5c vs. 5s. Yes, folks with larger phones are opting for something a bit more premium and a bit more utilitarian. While for the most part that’s not the case, there is a huge demographic for this choice: the 5s screen protector gets a 5” display, and the $40 off-case adapter gets a 5.5-inch display across. And while the 5c can be used as a basic phone for photo-centric use, what’s far more fun is to switch it into a phone for video calls, text and video calls.
I could also see some iPhone photo-processing apps for the iPhone 5c, as that’s where the bulk of my usage already occurs. But this

In addition, while the company says the app is really just a way to check in on which days to see which items are in stock, they will do so in a way the company is not just pushing to people, but also for those who don’t want and will probably miss some items that they’ll need (you can imagine that being one of the reasons the early prototype is just now being used, in fact).
The service is the latest from a larger company we’ve seen. Last year, it moved from mobile to mobile and continues to grow. The idea: the company plans to now move into virtual items, where it’s a different company than its original idea, in spite of the fact that it has created an iOS application called Stash it.
At the moment, the price is $59 on the service, and the only service for this new app is right now, it says. But the company, which started as a side project of the company back in December, says it is looking further.
We’ve reached out to Facebook and Pinterest (who are also both big names in the startup world) to learn more about these apps, and will likely follow up with some examples."
"The makers of the popular social networking app Jotly, which is also among the new crop of iOS 9 applications that’s opening up on the Mac App Store, just launched new versions of their application and update its user interface. The new apps are the second generation of the apps launched earlier this year, after it introduced a version for iPhone that could be better optimized for the iPad and iPhone 6 Plus. And a new application called Snack, also now available in the iTunes App Store for iOS 9, introduces a better, faster way to create and browse GIFs, according to the company.
“We’ve had Jotly for iOS for about two year, and it’s a full screen application, just a little text and images plus a photo. The new version just came out on OS X,” said co-founder Mike Arrington. “It’s been more of a work in progress for us. We wanted to make it easier to use.”
The updated Jotly for Mac application, which also introduced a new search feature that lets you type more than just links to find GIFs and add other GIFs of your choice. But the new versions don’t just introduce the search feature, which was arguably a new feature from the first generation, too. There are still the ability to browse your collection of GIFs, you find them automatically on the Mac App Store, and you can also click a button to save your favorite GIFs.
(We’re told the new design is more responsive on all the Mac apps, but the exact UI changes are not yet available.)

The update was first announced in March, and is available for download now."
"Viber has some good news for users who own a Mac, as it just announced the integration of voice calling into the desktop version of the service for the first time.
This is the first time that the desktop version of Viber will be a free access platform for users who have a Mac or a Windows PC.
The integration is now available across both desktops and laptops, as well, so long as they’re on the same network where Viber is installed.
Viber desktop users will now be able to search for, add or call their friends directly from Mac applications from the Mac App Store. There are also a limited number of Skype integrations available, but Viber says over 900 now are.
The company also today launched a standalone app called SMS+ for Mac, which lets users quickly send an SMS to any Mac running iOS 9 or Mac OS X 10.9 Yosemite.
Viber, which recently passed the billion-user mark, has built a solid operating system for voice calls over the past few years. The desktop version lets the company pick up your Viber number from your Mac, then it’s used on the Mac to do other things like call your business or government representatives, send photos and even text messages.
However, the desktop experience has fallen behind a couple of years ago on the desktop. According to founder Talmon Marco, Viber still has a long way to go to reach its one-tipping point in terms of how many people are on the mobile apps it already has.
The company, however, still has a long way to go before hitting that one-tide. Desktop dominance of Viber in its desktop software market is still in the distant future, however, and while Viber did successfully cross a threshold of 1 billion users back in September, it still has a long way to go to catch up with Viber for Mac, Viber for Windows and the iPhone.

v’s a whole lot bigger than most startups.” He is more than aware of this. The company has been in the news for weeks now, with the company’s funding news coming out at the same time that Apple announced its first $300 million fund for funding entrepreneurs.
All of this is well and good, but the company’s revenue and financial numbers look a bit different from that reported by the firm. Last quarter, its revenues come from its SaaS subscription model, which saw the company charge $4.6 million to users, half from those customers who used the free offering. On top of that, the earnings today showed that users and the company itself grew its monthly revenue by 60%, which it noted was half from the previous quarter’s $1.8 million revenue.
The bottom lines come from the company’s two years ago revenue of $2.23 billion, down 6%, compared to a year earlier of $3.91 billion.
Net sales came in at $2.85 billion, down 25% year-on-year and down 5% on a year earlier. The company’s Q4 revenue came in at $1.59 billion with earnings that came in at $1.49 per share.
Mobile Internet is a difficult business to understand, however, given its growing importance in how consumers and businesses are buying and using online applications and even with all its efforts to buy online from the likes of Amazon, Apple, Google and many of the others in this category, it has managed to turn that into an activity not as focused as other mobile services with large budgets like Facebook or Google.
But that’s a challenge that BlackBerry is facing in what is ultimately a long-term process where the company has to take on an emotional battle. In its early years, BlackBerrys were still the fastest-selling mobile device in history. But in the end, BlackBerry will need to better manage that development to keep up with its customers.
BlackBerry is showing a lot of promise in that regard, in fact, so the question is whether they can stay that way for the long haul.
“You’ve heard the great stories and all of these wonderful, innovative people over the last 10 years. I believe you’ll see things unravel on this balance sheet,” he said.
The question that remains is whether the company can make the necessary changes to its products to offset these challenges going forward, and that’s an important consideration. The company has previously acknowledged that it needs to make some radical changes to it services and make sure that BlackBerry remains relevant in the ever-increasing mobile ecosystem. This quarter, it announced that it has a “multi-billion dollar” business on a net loss of $400 million."
"You can take a photo of a model or anything that you would prefer them to share with friends, but Instagram can’t tell you how to share it. So for now it’s only showing a “Share an image” button where you can also edit it, but not how to turn your photo into a video like Facebook.
Instead, Instagram is slowly but surely building out its functionality to better help you decide how to share an image.
Right now, you can only share one photo at a time with an elligible photographer with the card as a preview. But you can also choose a longer photo, or a longer video, or a multiple image. You also need to specify the date with the timestamp. But there’s a new bar right next to each of those options with multiple different sized photo boxes around the image for sharing.

You can choose to share via multiple networks. And you can use multiple photo uploads.
When someone tags you in a photo, we automatically hide the photo from everyone.
In the past, you or whoever would have to be your real phone number. But as apps are becoming more integrated, you need your real phone number to be the home. It’s why Facebook even has a fake iPhone number in the system updates.
And that’s why this would be a good feature for Instagram’s sharing feature. It’s a way to get even more engagement out of your users’ photos by letting them be a more creative type of user.
These more creative capabilities would come in handy with Instagram’s photo filters which you can edit before adding them to your feed. I don’t know how other apps or apps could handle this, but Instagram did it.
Even if the feature isn’t perfect in its functionality yet, I’m sure the team is just getting started.
It’d be great to see if this is how Facebook will first go about adding additional photo sharing functionality like filters and cropping, similar to

 water, “more than 40% of our users are active”. A lot of people could say: “Good for us… but still complaining about spammy content.” Well, it would appear to us, too, if only someone would be willing to create an app that offered a free version of its service in hopes of stumping us cash that would be needed later. That app would appear to users in the hope of sprucing up their accounts and offering them a free option in order to continue using its service as a means to pay for things – but not without its users’ knowledge.
The answer to that would be a welcome addition, but there’s no evidence that any one person is willing to pay for a mobile version of a site without knowing how they find it, and a paid version of the site isn’t just something a few people can do. It would break the entire mobile advertising model to offer just a handful of apps.
As for its user numbers and engagement stats, in a report on SlideShare that analyzed how many of its users were using the company’s iOS and Android versions of its app in September, SlideShare says that it has now had over 1 billion monthly unsignored impressions for those apps on its network, a 60 percent increase from a year before. This is an enormous figure and tells us that SlideShare understands that this has a business model that requires multiple ways to monetize users. And it’s one that’s growing.
That business model doesn’t work as well with the free service SlideShare is offering, and that means that a substantial portion of its traffic gets churned out for reasons that have to do with things like getting people interested in something they don’t even want to pay for.

But SlideShare’s CEO, Raj Singh, said in an interview today that the company will not be selling the paid version of SlideShare. Instead, it plans to simply offer the free and pro versions to its users for free.
“The only thing that changed is the amount of ads and brands,” said Singh. “Everyone is a profit to SlideShare, but that doesn’t make us money. Our business model. We’re going to go out and sell advertising where we can.”
But while SlideShare may not be selling lots of ads at a cost where much of it is worth a profit to anyone, the company’s growth and traction across its network should make that choice easier."
"The buzz at the end (or the buzz at the beginning of) is that Apple will have a Q4 launch. If you think about it, it seems as if Apple wants us in on an email. It isn’t, or at least it wouldn’t be selling emails. And it may even be saying something like “We’re holding a press conference in just an hour!” or something. I don’t know you’re thinking about an email. It’s a marketing stunt. Apple probably can’t sell an entire block of time, so the buzz is going to involve things like this.
So why would there’t you just hold a press conference like this? Because you know what? Business Insider, the Financial Times, and many others reported on this. If the buzz at the end is that Apple has a Q4 launch, and the same thing happens on Thursday, it could mean that there are only three days to go.
If that’s true, no, it’s not a joke. Apple has a pretty strong lead over the analysts.
The analyst firms and the press outlets are the ones that will have to get this year’s Q4 results. To be clear, we don’t mean that the quarter is a joke. While this whole thing is being blown, the reality of the two days preceding the Q4 count, is that the actual count is higher than we expected. For reference, analysts were calling for the $4.7 billion bill in Q4 2013, after looking at Q4 2013 sales.

Let me make this clear: This is not a prediction. To me, it feels so absurd that it comes as a surprise that the analysts didn’t see the count of Q4 sales. It’s a joke.
We could look at the first two quarters and compare Q4 sales numbers. Apple didn’t do anything in terms of sales. That was until September, when the iPhone 5 got leaked. What happened in those four months, happened today.
If Apple didn’t do anything then, then it would have to do something pretty much like this. By making an announcement, Apple has announced that the iPhone is doing better than it did two years ago,

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
-year-old CTO and former CTO of Adi.com.
With today’s funding announcement, the company is joining a small group of angels who have backed tech startups that span multiple verticals. One member of the team that has joined, the company, co-founder of Cintrifé, and one of the lead mobile architects, the former co-founder of I Can Haz Suh, the founder of Adi.com, has now joined Tonsser and is the CEO of Hales, the company’s new fund for investment in internet and mobile startups.
As a part of the new investment, Cptrifé’s new partners will become board members.
Tonsser is a Y Combinator-backed company with a $100 million target for a $1 billion business. The company builds a cloud-based tool to build websites and applications to integrate e-commerce, payment, and payment platforms among others.
While one might not think a cloud-based service will make it into a major consumer technology player, the team here believes it can. “Tonsser and the Cptrifé team at Tonsser have proven that there is an untapped opportunity to make a social infrastructure to scale out,” said cofounder Saul Gharana. “The challenge is to build a platform that can be broadly supported by a web of all vendors, enabling a distributed application or a more unified one within our platform.”
Tonsser raised more than 70 employees in the past half of a year alone, the latest round of which closed in October at a total of 140 for the year. More than a dozen other startups have been valued at over $1 billion in funding across 15 rounds.
According to TechCrunch sources, Hales is not alone in thinking the $1 billion market is already saturated. In fact, the company was one of the very first to focus on serving enterprises and the “bigger” web businesses over the past year. Other popular contenders like Apollo, Docker, Twilio and WebRTC have been very successful in this space. And, of course, they are all going to be raising another round of funding soon."
"Another startup that wants to help media publishers keep a lot of customers, including generating revenue themselves, is announcing a $6 million round of funding today (via Citi Ventures). New backers include Greycroft Partners, Citi Ventures, General Catalyst, and Sutter Hill Ventures. The new round follows a Series A of almost $8 million raised by the company in 2011 and brings its total funding since that time up to $8.5 million. It says that its headcount now is double its headcount in 2012.
If you don’t know some of the company’s history, the company was part of the first acquisition by Yahoo! in 2002. It’s co-founded by Jason Whitmire, a former product head of Yahoo! and now its chief product officer.
As we reported earlier, the company has built a product called a “proprietary cloud platform” designed to “grow, optimize, and retain user engagement.” In other words, the company’s core technology is now the same, but instead of having to build those products separately, users can access the platform from the site itself.
The company says it provides customers with more than 600 partner sites, like eBay, GQ, Forbes, and The Economist, as well as the following products: Get Satisfaction, Get Satisfaction Marketing, Get Satisfaction Sales, and The Daily Dot, to name a few. It also offers apps like Couchbase to manage their ad campaigns and social media pages.
More recently, the company introduced a new feature that allows publishers to take “full-service, instant messaging” to their digital fans as well as an analytics function to track their engagement.
And, as mentioned above, in order to sign up for an account, businesses need to register with the site first through their accounts management system (which can sometimes even be a competitor to AdMob or Adify) and then the company will automatically add them to the site. The company says that it will reach out to partners who will also get added to its network. As of February 2012, its network had 2,300 members.
CEO Jim Sebel says that he wants to build up a small “consumer technology business” in order to use the service to help media company brands interact with people on the Web.
More broadly, Sebel wants to build an “online sales team” that can take all of a company’s web activities into a mobile, mobile, or tablet-based environment, or take advantage of features like push notifications, email, and on-site signup. He also says that

 closing the funding at some point today’s funding announcement, as the U.S. firm has a large number of its own paying customers.
It’s a sizable amount for a company with a relatively small engineering team, but the company has been careful not to raise this much money from venture investors so far because of those considerations."
"The launch of Chrome OS, popular in developing countries where consumers are often more price sensitive — but also not as technologically sophisticated — as smartphones and tablets continue to become ever more affordable.
With Chromebooks, Chrome OS laptops and tablets, you can access the mobile web without having to purchase a full-sized PC in an office. The company’s first consumer hardware product is $75/$35 the Chromebox, also known as the “Google Docs for Chrome Browser,” which features all the specs you would expect in a browser, like Chrome OS hardware and more, as well as support for web apps like Google’s Chrome browser as a starter kit.
The Chromebook has been designed by Yves Behar, the famed designer behind Google’s Chrome browser.
Bour was in early discussions with Google and HP, but it was not until Google offered him a potential return on his investment. Instead, Behar took a job as CEO of a startup in 2010.
The first Chromebook, on the consumer version, will be available this spring. More pricing details are available here.

The Chromebox for Chromebook is a unique device, in the Chrome space, because it’s a Chrome web browser to boot, but it also offers full-sized Chrome on OS X for Mac devices. Other Chrome products including the Chrome browser for Chrome Browser (Chromebox for Mac) are not currently available across the board in terms of the OS layer. (And Google doesn’t have a web-based desktop browser.)
The new Chromebox is about half-baked in at least. The only remaining question is whether that will be the full year of Chrome-powered Chrome for Mac hardware with a lifetime window.
It also, like other Chrome products, has a full-scale manufacturing facility based in China, which will open sometime this year. (Google had previously stated that it would not make the switch over full-sized production units.)
The Chromecox laptop, which I used for a brief hands-on at an office, works best on a MacBook with Retina displays and a top-of-rack hard drive drive for high speed connections. In general, it’s a hard drive but has an optical disk drive card for storage. The system also offers up to 32GB of internal flash storage storage, which also helps with web apps."
"As a new consumer device based in the enterprise, the Apple Mac line of computer hardware is a natural fit for enterprise productivity. But while Apple is pushing out updates related to iTunes Radio and various mobile apps designed for the workplace, its first foray into the enterprise with the new Apple Watch is still very much in the experimental phases.
We have spent some significant time looking at the watch, speaking with Apple CEO Tim Cook and other Watch team members, and evoking the same feeling that was present on the iPhone in the past, which was a bit frustrating to me when we first arrived by and said the early demos were fine.
That being said, the new watch has a lot of advantages that consumers could appreciate.
First and foremost, unlike the iPhone, the watch has a very large rectangular glass screen. The display itself is 320×290 with a crisp black background and a fully-color LED strip. It also has a full size physical key strip which could be used in a number of different use cases, like giving your co-workers an easy key to be identified, like for a birthday or other event, for example.

The new device is based on the same tech it used on the iPhone, which is an accelerometer and GPS chip. It also has a dual-core processor, and Apple offers two color LEDs along with a blue LED, a grey, red and green light that can be used in both manual and wireless mode, as well as a low light. It connects via Bluetooth.
For people who own two or more Apple Watch models, you’ll find each of them with a yellow and green strip, which offers a nice variety of viewing options. On the bands side, there is an unified black bar on each band, which is very convenient when setting it up in a meeting for instance.
I’ve been testing the Apple Watch with a few coworkers and the overall impression it delivers the same set of good features you’d get on an Android watch:

As a watch lover, I’m pretty excited to try it out for myself. While the screen itself is a bit of a shock, watch apps and Siri

 experience or anything else.
For example, with the new app, when you have photos, you can also choose to send them to others. When you later return to the app, you can continue to share it with others. And if you have a group of photos to upload, the app will automatically create an image that everyone can view at once. (I’d recommend sharing a bunch in a group, but we’ll see.)
Co-founder and CEO Ramin Gutsimani said the company has designed the experience to be very simple for new users, who may not have tens or hundreds of thousands of photos on their servers. With the older app, you could share one or several shots with your friends, but with the newer app, you can send up to 10 or 15 photos. (A comment from the company indicates that the app may be used by families, but that’s not something the company can clarify.) You can also choose to make the sharing limited, to “save space” on those moments, or turn it into a shared album.
The company has raised $3.6 million from angel investors and from Tribeca Angels.
A version of the app called MoPop is already available for iOS users in the iTunes App Store.
Update: Oh, and if you know the answer, we’ll check it out."
"I’ve always wanted to work on a company based in the Valley (or just Silicon Mountain, I always hated working in a startup factory for a variety of reasons, but this one being one of the most relevant for a reason why I found it awkward as a writer). That is why I was glad to get an interview with the guys at Faces.
They had a little trouble with me not agreeing with their title (they were a miscellaneous blogger, with an interesting, but not necessarily original-ish blog of their own, in fact), but at least with an interview they were more forthright than I’ve ever felt they could be.
To be clear, they’re not trying to beat me in terms of what they’re doing. They’re not asking me to work with them to change their opinion on me. They are simply offering my opinion.
So, there’s a bit there about not having to change their opinion. And in my heart, I’m going to stick with my name. I’ll leave that to other developers for how they decide to take that approach.
But when you think about how important mobile can be, I have to really give them props for thinking they’re interested and thoughtful.
The guys (who were friends, but not employees) were mostly in the basement and, as usual, being polite.
I took the interview a bit longer than usual, but it was worth it, so I want to give them more credit.
The entire conversation was peppered with questions (I’ll get to that in a second) about their company.
TC: So what’s the secret behind all this growth? Were you able to reach this kind of scale with small teams?
HN: I think we’re growing by making product things more user-friendly, but there’s a lot to grow here that will eventually surpass the last few million users. [We] don’t really view ourselves as a platform [just]–we’re a mobile-first business.
What other mobile companies have been growing by doing? To me, it boils down to a big ‘volume bar’ – it’s the big guy in the market. This volume bar has limited scope for growing volume but not always for your ability to gain new users. And, as our first users are now driving our product, it will be important to scale up with small or even a much smaller teams over the coming weeks and months as we make major product improvements and features.
TC: How are you going to shift from being an “opportunity” company to being something totally different?
HN: In terms of the difference between this company and others, I’d say that Foto was pretty much always going to be a mobile product, a “micro site”-like tool, but then we started moving into a bigger organization, which had a team of 5 people plus all the tools like web analytics, data warehouse, etc.
TC: So then how have you been able to scale up to this size?
HN: Really, I’m happy to say they’re able to do the scale at scale. So for now, scaling really isn’t as effective as you could have been in the past because [you have to] sell [your] product on a basis of volume first.
TC: How will your team members have the ability to take direction in the products they�

.
The new feature makes sure that when someone sends their text, Facebook will recognize the address by name, but not recognize whether it’s a mailing list alias, Facebook Page URL, or other piece of information that indicates it’s a Facebook list.
This may be a somewhat awkward feature and the only way I have seen it interact is through messaging apps like WhatsApp which automatically respond to direct messages.
Of course, this kind of automatic response is somewhat of an upgrade, but I’d like to see more automation across Facebook’s services, rather than having to open and select multiple suboptions that are only used if needed.
After all, if Facebook could learn who each of your friends are, and get this information, it could use this to make smart recommendations whether it wanted you to see the news feed or not.

While I’ve been writing about Facebook for years, some of my personal favorite ways it stacks content into the feed include the News Feed, News Feed auto-responding if your friend shared something, its “Nearby Pages” section for more Facebook-related content, and friends you’re already following but may not have seen yet.
But if Facebook really focused on automating how this work, it could either start offering a feed or an auto-reply button.
While Facebook doesn’t offer push notifications for individual friends (as they’re on iOS) Facebook does let you push a link to your Page. So here’s what it would allow you to do if you’re on mobile, and if you receive a Facebook notification, you can check out notifications about the message and reply to your friend without giving it to launch or check to see more posts.
But all this would have to do with automatically crafting content into the Facebook feed with every Facebook user in the U.S.

A Facebook spokesperson told me recently that they’d be “looking at ways to make the feed smarter for people [so] people can see content that’s only relevant to them.”
But when I started reading this post, I was underwhelmed. I didn’t get the sense of how smart Facebook was in using this as a part of the feed, but I also didn’t get the impression that it was a way to build a more personal and complete personal brand in the same way that the site itself became the central window into a person’s identity.
This isn’t a surprise on its face. The site likes to show off how it will let users build their personalized, complete and connected Facebook identity. After all, it’s the company’s business model that will ultimately force Facebook on new users and bring in dollars, or users who want to have better access to their posts and information.
But it isn’t a surprise to see there be a part of the business to build your online identity, if only for a small piece of the pie.
I don’t know the exact way Facebook is choosing to look to us to use the service as a new platform to support its identity business. Facebook says it’s planning a series of new products that will help the identity system better understand user behavior and usage patterns.
On its mobile apps Facebook will begin showing the top 20 Moments, Pages and photos from users — a more personal version of the “Like and comment” button it began showing on web before bringing its identity suite to mobile. That way, Page posts will appear in the Trending and Most Recent sections to let users vote on whether the user has any interest or “like” a post. After the post, users will be able to like it.
On the ad network side, users will be able to browse ads inside Facebook.

Facebook tells TechCrunch “We’re excited to take together this new integration.”
If Facebook is truly looking to take steps such as this, and make the user experience itself more like the mobile app, Facebook may just take steps in this direction with the goal of avoiding this integration becoming a waste of users time — or more of a distraction than the user experience. But if the feature works and the new functionality is useful, then I could see a lot more Facebook coming.

"When Facebook announced it would finally start rolling out money transfers in the US, it promised to put the feature on all US  to people in its two markets, Australia and Canada. Today it rolled out money transfers from Canada as well. Facebook is also rolling out a new payment card for Australians who want to send money to friends abroad.
Facebook first started working on money transfers from cash and credit cards almost a year ago, though it was sure to first test

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 pre, but in order to make the same or better, consumers have to actually dig around and open the app, according to the new feature’s creators, whether they need to use the built-in browser, or are just interested in learning about a new way to navigate the web or communicate. Today, the company is rolling out a couple of new enhancements to its browser that were built to give the app even more mobility and a more personalized experience.
The first is a new browser menu that is now powered by a new, HTML5-based plug-in for Chrome that it designed to take advantage of the app’s existing plug-ins, and to add a layer of chrome on top.
The plug-in is built on the standard Google chromelet, as well as the new Chrome mobile browser, as well as the Chrome plug-in for Chrome. The extension has a new domain (“e,g.com”) and is meant to offer easy search and browsing, and also support the new mouse.

The second piece is an auto-save feature that automatically saves a website in a cookie-free state after it is used.

“We found people today use different browsers, and this extension works for all them. We built it in a way that makes sense for users,” says co-founder Terence Riggs, explaining the motivation here. “The ability to load sites quickly and get pages written in HTML5 is something we got from users, so we decided to build this functionality into the Chrome plug-in.”
The new plug-in works via Chrome’s plug-in pages itself. “It just works for Chrome,” Riggs adds.

The extension is available today, and the Chrome plug-in will also soon get support for Windows, Mac and HTML5, to give users a more modern experience.
As for the app itself, it’s also being expanded using new APIs, Riggs also notes. Now, when users do want to add the extension to their browser, they can use a bookmarklet, e.g. iChrome. To access the plug in, users first click on the extension in the Chrome browser, then switch on an open Chrome window with the plug-in installed, after which they can open the plug-in by tapping “Add Chrome” from the browser itself.
The plug-in is completely free and ad-supported, which means that it won’t be used more like a plug-in, but will instead serve as the basis of a new app, similar to the one created by Kik – that was available earlier this year. (Kik is also still pre-revenue and is not yet commercially available).
In addition, the plug-in and the app are being made available on Android (Google Play) and Windows for further development. And there are no plans for a iOS app at this time.
As for the company’s roadmap, Riggs says that even at this low price point, the new plug-in is “far from being the cheapest,” but it certainly is not the lowest priced. His suggestion is to improve the plug-in through more sophisticated customization and integration features, as well as improvements to the app itself.
In fact, Chrome’s plug-in page shows a screenshot of a future feature that could be done with the plug-in.
But the plug-in was always a nice addition, even for users who use their browsers a fair share of the time. But the service needed more polish, and a little more support in some cases, to get a more robust launch, as its current state is.
The new plug-in is not a free download or includes in-app purchases (at least on the current look) – it’s just $1.99. Which makes it a reasonable entry-level price point. Plus, if you’re interested in the product, there’s a free trial link on the Chrome Web Store. For those who need more flexibility and don’t mind a little bit of customization, there is a higher priced version that starts at $6.99."
"While the U.S. is just about beginning to see a decline in its living costs and population, we’re also hitting highs and lows. Last year, we were near the highs and lows of life’s affairs, but in 2013, we’re going toward a bit of a low.
A few key factors are fueling record highs in housing demand, especially in the U.S., and lows and lows in retail stock.

bury, who runs the service.
It’s hard to pinpoint, she says, unless you know how the system works.
“With the system we have developed, a software engineer can be set up, with a developer and a lot of ease, to deploy an application onto a company network, and the application can be updated in a company to work independently in many different ways,” she says. This could be a company’s infrastructure, a software unit. Or even a product. Or a customer.
“The way you use the service, with the ‘in’ concept, is that you don’t have to do anything but to get the product done,” she adds.
As an example, Schreyer used a messaging application called Beamly, developed by a client that has since been incorporated into eBay, to send a message to a group of consumers, which they use as a conversational ad buying platform. And by extension, they use Beamly to track ad ROI — by running bidding against those messages.
Schreyer also used a messaging application called Econocom, for something he refers to as super simple collaboration apps — such as a note-taking app for example — for a task he previously did with a product manager.
“You can use any tool, including Econocom, to build your project, with a view into the entire company,” he says.
The idea here is to add a level of ‘smart’ thinking to help with what he talks about as the need for modern-day collaboration in a “real-time and emotionally dense” industry.

“With the advent of the computer, the speed and pace of development with which we have been able to develop applications has skyrocketed,” he adds. “The new generation of developers use tools and technologys that were developed five years ago, and the application developers of today see the application they are developing more as an operating system that responds to, and reacts to, the social streams of millions of people communicating in the real-time instances that are increasingly not built on a server, but on a shared and linked environment.”
But the bigger picture for how such a widespread emotional, and possibly quite literal emergence of the enterprise is going to play out. That’s where things are heading — and where the data is at risk of not being captured.
“When the app developer knows where to look for, and who to target and how to push that message to market, and they can see the value of that message to their customers, they can start to push all those messages to their customers without ever having to record and parse through a lot of big data analysis,” says Schreyer. “We believe they will use their own data to create better personalized experiences. And that’s what we’re excited about… as well.”"
"Ticket sales company The Eventbrite is today announcing that it has raised £4.3 million ($6.5 million) in Series C funding, led by London equity firm Mutong Holdings. Other investors in this round included Mutong’s existing investor Harbinger Capital and the two T-Venture Capital funds: David Hassell, who led the round with Harbinger and Michael Jackson. The investment brings the total raised to between $19 million and £24 million, a combination of debt and equity based on a €$2.2 million ($3.4 million) investment in the company in March 2012, just under a year prior to this round.
I’ve been told that The Eventbrite has seen $9.25 million (€9.5 million) in sales since 2012. If you divide by last year the company grew 33%.
I’m told (via another tip) that when this latest financing was announced, its revenue came in at around $4.5 million for the year — with the last $3.5 million of revenues being from ticket renewals.
While the Eventbrite says it continues to grow, with total bookings at over $15.2 million last year, the company is looking for an exit. Hence today’s raise.
“I think it’s a safe bet that if we were to go for an IPO, the ticketing industry is going to adopt a new paradigm and look at us as an attractive company,” The Eventbrite founder and CEO Steve O’Hara tells me. “If we continue to grow at a healthy pace, I wouldn’

�re getting the go of it.
“We think that our users will continue to be very active and engage as they connect to different partners in our platform. The next wave of partners for each platform will be announced in the near future,” said Rajan Patel, SVP, Social Biz at Lumi, in a statement. “We are also keen to work with great partners to integrate other services into Lumi to enhance their user experience. These partnerships will help us gain deeper insight into this market of users who are connecting to other apps in a ‘lumi-like’ way.”
To that end, in the terms of service agreements, the platform does not allow apps to share information to any other services — so those who do decide to add others to the platform are not then deemed out by the app — and vice versa.
Lumi doesn’t want users to think of it as a general privacy-invading hub for connecting multiple apps to users so sharing info is obviously going to come with some racial and class overtones. It’s doing this by sticking to a neutral policy on sharing and access — so you can upload a file to whatever service you want and no one’s going to come calling for it.
It’s a pretty impressive move considering we’d previously been discussing of similar services offering — including Tumblr — forgot to put through an emergency check-up purchase a few days back after a woman from the south coast managed to get into an Uber driver who then hit her head and ran into her.
Lumi’s service was only appearing recently, due to the fact the startup was funded by LA-based incubator Y Combinator for several months, and has been flying relatively under the radar in the US. (It has raised a $1 million seed round for its seed funding from Lightspeed capital and Digital Garage — the latter was started by Lightspeed investors, like Maverick and Milton Berlucchi – and an LA accelerator called LAUNCH.)
So far the company has achieved a very high-level of engagement on its platform. Lumi counts more than 40,000 users at this point and more than one million on its product roadmap by the end of this month.
“We’re aiming at both individuals and companies, both major companies,” says Khalaf says. “We really want to give users an easy, stable, easy to use, robust platform for connecting all these services. That’s the vision we have.”
Notably absent in this approach — which is clearly all about getting as many apps and services on board as possible — is a business model for Lumi’s cloud storage play. The core product is free to download and use — so there’s not the potential for making money off the service at this point. “We have a good business model with a business model that isn’t based on advertising or subscription. It’s also a good business model for supporting the ecosystem,” says Khalaf. “We are looking towards monetization by the product.”
The app has a single purpose though, the idea here is not to compete in the deep space of file storage where the big cloud storage players are likely to be looking, via the walled garden of third party services that have flooded users with software for years — but rather to offer a stripped-back solution designed to fit in with the way people now access files online.
“We don’t have a business model with this app since the cloud storage,” Khalaf says. “It’s actually very focused on that. It’s not trying to be everything. What it is is is just the first app to connect all these services together. So we decided, for this first app, we’re just going to try it as a starting point because we need people to sign up and use the app. This is just the beginning for us.”"
"The first week after Apple’s WWDC 2014 event, the buzz over the next iPad and its 7.9-inch iPad Pro has been palpable. But as Apple goes back to an official launch of its tablet-focused iOS 8, the price of the devices continues to drop with some regularity.
For $329.99 off a year-long iPhone and $179.99 on an installment on an Apple Watch, both a 9.7-inch iPhone and a 13-inch model of the same device now offer a lot of scope for serious money. If Apple

And this is a crucial part of the story we believe, that we are on the verge of a golden age of mobile.”
While Nokia is showing off its hardware with Windows 8, in recent weeks more and more of the big OEM manufacturers have shown their willingness to build and invest in their own homegrown tablet hardware. Lenovo and Apple both put money into the tablets and have more to talk about.
“There’s a good partnership here. We haven’t met but it’s something that we would like to discuss,” Maison d’Hive said. “We have great respect for Apple but the partnership is very technical.”"
"The Apple TV is going to get some more serious hardware over the coming days, but most of the focus has to go to the iPhone. A new report from the Wall Street Journal claims that a redesigned version of the Apple TV could be on the way.
Rumors suggest that the updated version will feature thinner designs, sporting a brighter color on the back. It’s also reported to come with a new USB-C connector at the back with support for faster flash storage.
The WSJ also says that the redesigned Apple TV would feature new software features including a new app platform, improved user interface for iOS, and possibly a new “screen-mode” feature to let people watch the news with a single or two-handed presentation.
The tech specs come from 9to5Mac, which says that the redesigned Apple TV would include a new interface for iOS apps that supports a split-screen experience. Both existing and future versions will sport new iOS 8 design features, of course. One of the key features of iOS 7 has been the gradual rolling out of support for the USB-C standard, so this would make the device considerably thinner.
The iPhone has already been rumored for a bigger-screened iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus model for the past month, and the WSJ says it’s also rumored to be introduced in an updated model for the iPhone 4S. A stronger camera and lower-power consumption might also make that possible.
The fact that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are only the latest version of Apple’s video-focused smartphone business could signal a shift in thinking as the focus shifts to newer and more battery-efficient mobile devices. There’s reason for that, too, as video consumption habits have exploded as smartphone cameras have gotten increasingly thinner while mobile phones have more power.
In January, 9to5Mac revealed that Apple would likely build an early beta version of iOS 8 with Touch ID sensor, meaning that this could include the new fingerprint authentication tech introduced in the iPhone 5s. A Touch ID sensor could also allow users to store more of their credit cards on their device, and use a fingerprint-based passcode option within apps, instead of requiring users to enter all their passwords on a single device.
Another option is said to be unveiled on stage: Lightning Earner, technology from a third-party application developer. The flagship Lightning Earner iOS app for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is already on iOS 7.1 (so presumably Apple has not been able to release all the new features as of yet), with a Touch ID sensor, as well as a new fingerprint-based passphrase feature. Fingerprint-based authentication might make sense for a more secure device aimed at the enterprise market.
Apple has said that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus will also feature an unlock code feature for iCloud-based photo and video storage, which would make it much easier for an end user to access their camera and other files using Touch ID, which is the focus in this report. Apple is also reported to be working on an iPad Air version, both in June and early July; there too, it could also debut a slim, waterproof device that uses Touch ID for authentication."
The rumors that Apple was set to release an iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus model were in line with earlier reports, suggesting a larger screen would make sense, and that it’s also on the way. The bigger-screened iPhone 6 would also technically support a larger-screen version, and be more rugged, and would presumably allow Apple to add its own unique Touch ID sensor to its own device.
A smaller, more square-shaped iPhone 6 would do a better job of appeasing the iPad user base, which is why Apple has remained steadfast in its decisions not to do anything smaller. In fact, even just a couple of weeks ago, many analysts predicted the demise of the iPad, with this year’s numbers suggesting that Apple would be bringing it back to life with some tweaks in future product strategy.
The big question is when, or if, Apple will ever release a larger or round-edged version of its product to hit the market once again – or whether it’s more likely to be scrapped for thinner, cheaper versions.
We know what the iPhone 5s

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Idle, like many startups and companies today, faces the potential reality of the fact that for every two or three quitters, there are five or ten, all in the world, and therefore, there are a very small number of individuals of provenance capable of solving a problem.
The market size of the entire market is also tiny compared to the number of sales and marketing channels to reach a company of this size. There is a reason why the term “uncomfortable” is tossed around: It’s unpleasant. It’s not uncomfortable of its own. It’s painful. And it’s profitable.
That being said, it’s a competitive environment, so companies that aren’t actively looking for the best talent and can actually make the best hire are the ones to jump into the pool. This is where a company can emerge from that position — a company that is good at hiring what it claims to be the best of the best, and that has the skills, expertise and experience to succeed and succeed.
In the same way companies like Facebook are well positioned to be at the forefront of new connected-touch devices, the same could be said for the next generation of internet devices. That means, companies like Netflix, Spotify, Hulu, Netflix and Netflix are hiring at a rapid clip.
The reason I see it is, with advancements in the cloud, we are starting to see an increase, in terms of scale, as the number of small and medium-sized business’ applications flourishly hacks off of the main computing paradigm of computing: servers, file servers, printers, keyboards and computers.
While we continue to see a maturation of computing environments from smartphone to Internet-scale platforms like Facebook, we are also seeing that demand for an easier, better way to access web applications across those small screens is increasing exponentially.
In the next generation of computing devices, the ability to access and search across the web is starting to emerge, and while there have been strides in a number of realms (like apps and services like YouTube, email and Twitter) these steps have all been taken to make it easier and faster for users to access and search beyond legacy, on-prem-based applications, or smaller, static web pages.
The ability to access native apps is also getting increasingly important for consumers, as they start to find out that all, as well as their own websites, mobile apps also have to run on all the devices they require.
The world is also becoming increasingly sensitive to security breaches, both online and on their devices, and this, coupled with the rise of end-user-facing applications, is making the market a fascinating place for those who can turn to other means of access and authentication when need be.
To that end, in the long run, there’s going to be an explosion of applications and services designed to keep us safe as new devices are created. And, with they come, the market for a multitude of services and applications that offer additional security for just about anything a user can turn on and access on – from homes to shopping portals or anything else you want to manage.
It really is about what is happening on the device, and more importantly what they are not doing (a privacy policy to protect your data and your services via the use of this platform), and more importantly why that is happening.
I think the most interesting aspect to the cloud and server/server is that it’s no longer just about an object. It’s about the user. And that’s what makes these devices so powerful.
To me, it’s an incredible transformation in terms of the potential to extend the ways we operate. One might ask, “How do you get the most out of servers while also spending less?” It might be simple: Less time on servers means that users are accessing them in the way they were intended. That means there’s a whole host of services available out there that can and are better.
While server architectures help you with ease of operation and increased speed, in the end, you’re sacrificing security because you’re not looking for the sake of the server. The goal is to use these to secure the device in the way it was configured and to secure the server in the manner you needed it. This is a big, potentially very valuable change.
At the moment, the cloud can be thought of as a single, monolithic system. For me, a single device can be pretty much any hardware device. If it’s a PC, it should have everything you need to stay current. But if the servers are in a data center, you don’t want to lose everything. The answer to that is software.
So what makes a hardware device like the Apple Watch

 they are available for purchase from the Amazon or in-store kiosks at participating retail outlets. Users can buy games by credit or debit card, as well as purchase items via mobile phone, and many more.
The “Best Choice” award is worth about $2 billion annually, according to KPCB researcher Mark Lander. However, more data has to do with how individuals tend to value the goods and services being offered by large e-commerce companies, rather than, say, just individual retailers.
“There is little doubt that an item is best served using a location where that item is available,” Lander says of Amazon’s selection of mobile-based and web-based services. “But the fact of the matter is that mobile carriers and Google devices have been used to purchase food and drink items, alcohol, and groceries, and that transaction behavior makes them more attractive to consumers.”
KPCB’s data backs this up, and reveals that the average user browsing the mobile platform through Google or mobile.com is at 0.43% for each product; that is, when the user browses the mobile site, the web app or mobile-based web site. It also pays an average of 0.48% for each product; a bit higher than 0.75% for every product.
In the table below, you can see how the various segments of the mobile storefront, including the mobile, and the web or mobile web, compare favorably to each other – or they do not.
The mobile shopping experience has a lot on its side to it, if you’re a shopping cart user. The company’s mobile shopping platform includes the ability to send an email, access the mobile app, click and swipe through a “fraud-free” shopping cart, or tap a hyperlink button on a mobile site – a feature which KPCB researcher Lorn Sysen found a disruptive innovation for mobile browsers in the mid-2010s.

KPCB also took notes about how mobile is playing in the shopping experience on various retailers’ websites, which is helpful that you might not have seen them in your store, but is a useful addition to help your mobile browsing experience.

“A mobile Web-based browser does not display a banner ad if users click to a mobile site in the same browsing session.” Sysen’s study on mobile browsing was based on two research experiences, but even while the two browsers could see identical responses, the mobile Web browsers could get the better results than “one or two browser sets of responses.”

“Mobile browsers render the same ‘content’ ads as desktop browsers in that the mobile browser provides in the form of pop-up advertising displays, and as such is different from a desktop browser in that the mobile browsing experience is better than a desktop browser.”

Sysen found that mobile users who scroll through a mobile page, or clicked through via a pop-up ad, were the same people who didn’t purchase items from the mobile Web page. That could mean there isn’t much difference in that users who click through on the mobile page would get the same experience as they would on the site or mobile web site. KPCB believes mobile browsers on the web and mobile browsers on iOS and Android are just two emerging technologies.
“It is likely that, similar to the changes in user response in mobile browsers from the beginning of 2010, this is just the tip of the iceberg, and there is not very far to go.”
But KPCB’s Lander believes mobile browsers on Android and iOS are also the types of browser the two emerging technologies have to watch out for. “Browser for Android and iPhone will be the next important step for the mobile browsers for these two new technologies,” he says.
Although this doesn’t rule out the idea of more mobile-focused browsers being developed at a later point, we’re asking Amazon to bring that technology to its Amazon mobile platform – which could potentially make for a compelling acquisition, if there is interest."
"Google has confirmed it acquired Nest, and it was the first time all of Google’s products are now owned by Nest, the hardware maker co-founded by Google co-founder Sergey Brin.
This seems to be an interesting deal given that Google, which is an investor in Nest, now owns Nest, because it was first bought by Nest.
There is a history of Nest acquisition rumours (not to mention a possible acquisition from Apple) having been circulating for some time now, but Google is the first of several mobile companies owned by the phone maker. So, to be clear, Google took a $15 billion loal last fall, so this is a pretty massive investment from Android.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 the company is looking at approximate $5 billion in revenue, “Insightly has no immediate plans to expand internationally. Instead, it plans to grow and add more features over the years, eventually eventually establishing a European headquarters in London.”
While you could call Insightly an enterprise tool, it’s more akin to an open service portal like Pinterest. You’re given the freedom to add whatever feature you want quickly, and it’s the same for a variety of services you can add on a sliding scale. There’s not a huge amount of detail here — Insightly provides a pop-up of the most interesting data points to your business, with a visualized view of your company in action — and that’s about it.
The goal of these companies is for more insight to come up with more great data. While it uses a sophisticated approach to visualize the data, Insightly is giving it a turn up.
At its core, Insightly is trying to provide a set of real value — and that can entice businesses.
“If I hope [sales] to make 10X more in [marketing] this year and [reduce] expenses 50 percent, it can be capitalized, [or] if I want to grow, [we want] to be a more sustainable company and I want to be able to reinvest it,” he says.
The challenge will be in getting enough customers and convincing them to use the service as much as it can, though. You can add features as you need, as Insightly is intentionally trying to create a platform for its software to flourish.
“Once we take off, we’ll see a very strong demand for our solutions among companies and a big market for IT,” he says. “Once we reach a certain scale, you’ll see a lot of opportunities [and] it’s in that process that we see what a lot of the potentials might be.”
While Insightly today is fully free to use, it will in future likely generate revenue by charging companies to use its analytics tools along with others like data warehousing service Insightly — which would be a nice add-on to the product. (Asking for a large pay-per-connection service would be a way to get even more use out of Insightly.)
To get the idea for Insightly’s model and to scale is a natural progression. “When we started raising money [in August] we were looking to go for 10X in 2014,” says Klöpping, who has been at the startup for the past six months.
On the product development process, he says he sat down with a number of startups before deciding on Insightly as its focus, as he’s seen how difficult it can be to convince big data researchers and other big data investors in an early trial run.
“We’re building [a] data platform that will be easy to use and that is not hard-to-use,” he says. “We hope that we’ll work with a large company like IBM who  will give away a bunch of machines, and use it to make recommendations in real-time.”
The company first started to test analysis with the U.K. government, which has since converted it into an enterprise-wide pilot — using data provided by the National Data Guardian.
“We are working with them on several projects right now, one being the NDA from the National Data Guardian, who would be helping them make a recommendation in the lead up to a national referendum,” says Klöpping.
This has been provided to a number of government departments in the NDA in recent weeks as a tool to see whether such tools could be applied across the business — with the aim of having an effect on how data is being processed at the point of sale.
Numerous proposer and data scientists, from institutions like Imperial College London, have also raised money to fund their own analysts to see whether the concept is worth expanding into this space.
The aim here is clearly of a different kind — but no simple technique of data mining the masses of information available to the public.
Klöpping says Insightly’s pitch has always been to provide analysts with a better way to mine data so they can do more “actionable, proactive trading” — given it’s that relationship that will likely lead to more valuable trade.
“It’s all based on the same underlying principle of

’t unmute other people’s streams, but he did confirm to me that this is still “theoretical first implementation .”
Update: An earlier version of this post predicted that Apple would push all this back to Facebook. The “Mute” feature will actually go live for all users, as previously noted. For iPhone users, it means they can live stream from their camera directly to Facebook, which is now available for everyone on iOS.
If this is all the details, not everything is going away. However, some of them do let you watch more specific videos and see clips longer than your normal length, which may encourage you to post more videos more often. And for video uploaders, it could also encourage them to upload smaller videos, again in search of a high-quality look.

Here are Apple’s official blog answers and a short overview of what they’re saying, plus some thoughts on the feature:
First for the Apple iOS users, the idea here is that while other media services like YouTube, YouTube Red, and Netflix will hoover around you, Apple’s live video streaming app will pick up the best ones. In practice, the feature works quite well, although it took longer than I expected for the iOS version of the app to load up and launch.
It also does an impressive job, even if I didn’t know more about video compression, video quality or storage quality. However, since it uses Facebook’s Facebook Zero+ encoding technology, you won’t be able to search YouTube videos or use Facebook’s ‘Like’ button to watch YouTube Videos directly from the app. If you want to watch a YouTube video over the air, you’ll have to hit the “Watch With Facebook” button in order to get to the video page where it starts, but if you don’t, you’ll have to wait a few seconds for it to load.

The result, for those of you in the knowledgable world, is an app where video of all your friends and favorite famous YouTube videos are all mixed up into one Timeline, allowing you to skip forward and backward in time to see just the ones from their favorite YouTube Channel in this case. They can then revisit that channel and the friends are watching at the same time. The idea, though a bit dated and inelegant, is a fantastic way to watch something with friends and favorite YouTube clips that you know are going to be relevant to you.

In terms of the feature itself, Apple Music is probably on track for a big October launch, with its Apple Music Streaming offering set to arrive at the end of the year. If users are looking to listen to the same tracks all over again, in Apple Music, you can do that.
Also, Apple Music is about to get a lot smarter, thanks to big data harvesting capabilities. While previous generations of Apple Music have been slow and contained too much content, today’s service loads are designed to be efficient and make the listening experience as fast as possible. While this may sound like a big expansion in music, Apple Music is definitely not the center of the universe. It’s a big leap compared to previous versions of Apple Music.
There’s a reason why Apple Music launched with a bunch of content at launch, including iTunes Store songs, curated stations, playlists to see the top charts, Top Charts sorted in realtime to see which songs your friends are listening to, and over-the-air access to artists you follow based on the places they listen to on the service."
"Apple is expanding its Apple Care program for new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners today, and it’s bringing the savings to 10 million new iPhone 6 and 6+ owners. Apple says these new customers will get another $100 in savings for every year they use the service, and this is the first time the program has been expanded to new owners since 2011, following the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus support.
But what’s the big new feature in today’s new program? Apple says it’s introducing a $100 credit for each new iPhone, and that if you own an iPhone 6 or 6+ since the end of last fall, you’ll get the savings even if you’re not a new device owner.
Here’s how Apple describes the savings it will be bringing over to existing iPhone 6 and 6+ owners:
Here’s a couple more details about the coverage, including the device ‘s complete list of carrier partner locations:
The program has been previously expanded to new owners with the new iPhone 5s and 5c in September, and that was a year ago

, the more we can make a space for people to discover information about the product, the better we’re doing.”
The app also includes the ability to share videos, photos, and locations to Facebook and Twitter, and provides a neat little history of your activity for easy access back in the days of the ’Cause. In an era when people wanted to connect to the people behind their products, the app fit right into this mold – the focus on the user’s immediate immediate social context.
The app’s founders will introduce features to this week to make it even more competitive with the iPhone 5s and 5c, including the launch or sequel of a number of the new games to which Apple is announcing a number of new titles this week. But the iOS version is still a beta invite, and is a bit more behind the curve, even for the first time. The app is available now on the App Store in the U.S. and Canada."
"The tech industry is going in the direction of the startup, but in doing so, it risks reshaping the industry with the same forces that have defined the business for decades: a lack of competition, as well as an overreliance on consultants, experienced leaders to advise clients. And these problems are something we’re seeing increasingly with a new model of tech, where startups are being encouraged to go in the direction of consultants instead of building their own.
There are a growing cadre of people going through the stages of becoming consultants, and they aren’t necessarily t for the most part because they’re not necessarily well-compensated to jump into that business. As a former Google Product Manager, I’ve had the opportunity to work with many of these individuals over the past 17 months, and while they’ve improved my skills and grown competent, I feel that I’m just tapping into a trend.
And as you may have noticed, over the past year, a number of startup accelerators have emerged which are putting more attention to the problem of providing the right consultants to help clients.
Last year, I wrote about the rise in parallel camps and incubators, an approach that is reminiscent of the bootstrapped movement that “disruptive” innovation and disruption in the world of technology and software has, and is already being adopted by many smaller-to-midsize VCs.
The new paradigm means that the market is becoming increasingly fragmented, with boutique business consultants moving in different directions, so there is a growing opportunity for people unfamiliar with that market to get involved. And these people exist in many different parts of the spectrum from finance and marketing to consumer web development, so getting into the business is often the largest barrier to entry for individuals looking to enter the space.
Another new trend means that these young startup founders have fewer options on the funding or exit side. A lot of them are opting against the usual IPO scenarios and are putting their focus solely on bootstrapping or are bootstrapping just on the platform itself and helping others grow. A number of these startups are even incubated, while others are being spun out into standalone companies.
I also recently wrote about this new wave of small, stealthy VCs (which some are using terms and are now publicly available on AngelList) using their expertise to bootstrap startups without offering a public board member. You’ve likely heard of the “Silicon Valley startup factory” model, where venture funds run mini sfcs and are heavily invested in a specific product or service that goes live, and they invest about $50,000 of that “seed” investment into the business that will launch, typically in the form of a software-as-a-service or a pure-play SaaS business that would like you buy as its primary business later on to help grow their client/partner. Entrepreneurs are becoming disillusioned with that model, as that same trend is making a huge mark in smaller markets in North America and Europe.
In light of these changes, it’s no surprise that the “disruptive” trend is finding its way to Silicon Valley. There are also a few notable examples of emerging regional accelerators popping up in North America, like Y Combinator, TechStars and Startupbootcamp in Mountain View, for example. But some of these programs saw a “bridge” round of less than $20 million (which may sound like a lot, particularly when you understand that YC put $40 million into Salesforce.com back in 2008) and some of them are now looking to raise seed rounds.
What I learned, though, is that when you’re building an SaaS business, there is a tendency to give a big discount to the entrepreneurs who are using this method, and we’re seeing these companies get much larger exits. But what’s

 Android a little more. The phone will also do away with the phone’s physical keys. “This eliminates the need for keys as you don’t have a flat surface,” explains Benoit.
The phone works by projecting a different visual form of a touch interface onto the screen of its phone (hence the name “experience mode”). This is achieved by a series of gestures. These include lifting (up and down), pinning (up and down), bumping (x/y) and pressing (up and down) (x/y) on the same part of the screen.
Though not all of the gestural gestures are as easy as pressing and holding on the screen to initiate a touch, a large amount of it is necessary to achieve the “handling area” concept. Benoit claims an average of 40 to 50% of iPhone users do it right now.
“It’s the other major technology we don’t want to do right now, that we’ve not started with yet,” Benoit says. “There’s still a lot of things we want to do like putting pressure, and letting the keyboard have its own voice. We don’t want to start with any of those. We want to start with everything that’s possible.”
If the hands off feature is done and it has found its way into the UI, the goal is to explore other options. This will also help explore the ‘innate the screen, so something like an iPad Pro is possible and something similar could even be an option to the iPhone.
In terms of the final build of the new phone, Benoit says they are looking into 3D modelling to make the phone even smaller. “We are not ruling out 3D in the device because we have a lot of interest from those who are 3D photographers. We’re not ruling it out. We’re trying to explore it because it makes sense,” he adds.
Though the demo I saw featured some of the hand-drawn characters, that seems a little too early for a final release. Although they are animated and lifelike and quite lifelike, does it make sense? Would you want to take a photo on a phone or a tablet? I do, though, and I’ve got a camera in the bag.
The final camera on the device is nothing special if you’re going to use it to take photos and do flash photography on a tablet. However, it’s something a budding indie photographer could do if they’re intrigued by the VR medium or view as beautiful (as I am).
A 3D-imaging device could also be useful for photographers interested in the new immersive medium, as it will open up options for more creative apps to be created as the technology advances further.
For now, the aim is to showcase what the camera can do, as opposed to demos of the device and how it works. We can expect future device-based marketing offers to follow.
But then again, it is unclear why you would want to be creative with a hand-drawn character in a 3D space. Does the magic fade or does the character take a presumably lifelike face? Probably not, but who cares what the face looks like.
That said, if you aren’t looking for a lifelike face-replacing app then something like this would be very welcome.
One challenge of a 3D photo-capturing device is the fact you can’t move your arm. In fact, you’d need your hands to block your face. And so something like this could at least be useful, as a mask for faces in 3D virtual scenery.
If you have a phone with a VR headset then this ‘limting system’ could work well. Otherwise, we’ll probably just need to wait until Google does a consumer launch. The device isn’t yet available for a price-tag, so we’ll need to wait to see how much its price-tag stacks up.
You can see a few of the initial prices for the device below. Note that it won’t take a single picture — you have to capture a video first.

The current price-tag starts at $79 for the bundle. That will go down to just $49 to begin with, plus $49 for the screen, pricing starts at $119.8 for the bundle.
The device ships with a VR-capable device, so the 3D selfie stick that comes with the device is not included.
The current line up of devices contains devices including the Oculus Rift,

 Twitter (iStockPhoto) as well as Twitter, iQIYIYI,  Pinterest, Tumblr, Instagram, VK, and Flickr. (And we don’t mention Google+. The company declined a request from Getty in the first place.)

If the app is an example of Twitter’s “consumerisation of enterprise” strategy, as Twitter’s Sam Groetzinger argues, then this is just a case of a consumer app making a little extra cash. There is, of course, still money involved. And it will have to be earned."
"This past Tuesday, Amazon’s Kindle dedicated app store for Amazon Kindle tablets received its first major update in about a month — Amazon’s first event on the platform since its original launch in early January, 2013 where it first added the ability to install apps directly within the e-reader device and other types of reading device.
At that point, Amazon’s Kindle store was first opened up to other apps, which have also entered Google Play. Today, Android developers and others, who can submit their apps to the Amazon Apps Marketplace for distribution, can now get added to the new Android-based Marketplace by launching their apps — before they get added to their iOS App Store, of course.
So, looking at the new Android Marketplace as a whole, Amazon’s offering is only available to those who already have Google Play, and have previously launched their own Kindle apps. On that front, apps can now launch for other users to join in the process, which also now makes the process faster for those who don’t already have an app installed.
As for the update itself, the company notes that it was developed in-house, following customer demand:

Of course, the Android Marketplace isn’t going away entirely — after all, if you don’t intend for it to be the top app of any sort for users, you might still want to do it by putting the app within Amazon’s own apps marketplace instead. (The Android Marketplace is a separate app from Google Play, of course — so if you already have an Android app, you can still run it as a Google Play version, but then update to Android Play via the appropriate Android app installation software.)"
"Apple has added yet more social to the iPhone, launching Facebook Connect on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, as well as on the web with Apple Music. The new features bring personalization to the iPhone’s main navigation – the home screen or landscape.
The new features also make it easier to send or receive messages on the iPhone, and to browse the iPhone’s Gallery, which currently features photos and videos but increasingly also includes video content.
In case you were unaware, Facebook Connect’s launch last year marked the first time Facebook appears in a smartphone with an optical sensor. Some 4 million people joined the service in the fall of 2012 under the auspices of Facebook’s newly acquired acquisition of the social network Parse, a deal that put a focus on social integration. Since then, the Facebook Connect launch has grown to account for over 1 billion minutes of video views per day.
Facebook has a more organic spread of mobile users, however, which accounts for the difference in growth the service received from the iOS launch.
The social network now has over 1 billion active users worldwide, and now has over 400 million monthly active users, which has nearly doubled year-over-year and is now growing at double-double-digit rates. In addition, Facebook now has 658 million users on Android.
Facebook has also begun to test an Apple Watch integration, even adding it to iPhone 6 photos.
With Facebook Connect on iOS, on the web, and on Android coming soon (for the iPhone 5, iPhone 4K, iPhone 4S and Android Auto), it stands to reason that Apple’s latest iPhone device is already seeing similar functionality in the market. That’s largely because while Apple’s own phone is now optimized for this social network, the iPhone 5 or the iPhone 5c aren’t doing that yet, or there’s some in-development interest to that service going forward, it’s too early yet for what that means in terms of Facebook integration."
"I spent a chunk of my childhood not in the sports sphere, but the world of sports was about to explode in an instant, with the new wave of digital media and social gadgets. Sports metaphors aside, the technology that we humans now use to turn raw physical data into virtual games has completely changed the way we view games and the competitive landscape.
Social media and digital entertainment have not only changed many aspects of sports, but also the way we create and engage them with other sports. With social media, it’s all about who you are, how you play, which sport you’re participating in and

 over one or two days for each business. The first business, called the Downtime Junkies (DRY), has received $100 000 USD as an angel investment.
“I’m extremely happy that we’re making these people’s lives better,” said Jiraj. “We would not ask them to do this for us.”
The second choice through a series of interviews with DRY’s founders was chosen by DRY itself, as they found that more than 70 per cent of DRY’s community is female.

So not only is DRY aiming to do what other “work from behind the scenes” initiatives in the industry have been unable to do, but DRY wants to build products and support the startup itself while it’s growing. The exact structure of the company isn’t clear, but will be focused on one product platform that aims to do all that needs to keep DRY’s community hopping along in the future.
Meanwhile, for those keeping track of the startup’s progress, the company has revealed that over 100,000 users will join the platform by January 2013. If they don’t already regularly come to DRY and want to join as a user but there won’t necessarily be a dedicated app later on, there will be room to grow the business organically by encouraging founders to sign and recruit more users. According to Jiraj, he’s been particularly pleased to say that founder is in the process of signing on additional early users and reaching out to third-party sponsors to enable “more and more” marketing support.
“One of the reasons we had to be able to raise the money was to scale DRY and start building momentum in the market and get to the point where we feel confident starting to get traction in the market and to know where to be,” he said. He estimates that within about a year’s time, DRY is currently in the “double-digits” player in terms of revenue and growth.
In addition, DRY’s plans for the time are also to increase its headcount by some 20 staff, with engineers, product, and business development remaining within the company and only hiring in engineering, business operations management, sales, and marketing.
So far, the company has raised a total of $8 million and is in the process of closing a new round."
"A new report by the U.K.’s ICO of Accountsancy outlines a series of proposals for how it would be able to “sign off” UK citizens, existing companies and the companies they work with by offering them a “passportfolio” of UK accounts, from which they would be able to draw the necessary professional services, such as cash transfers, invoicing, payroll, administration, credit monitoring, KYA/AML and anti-money laundering ‘emergency services’.
The ICO’s analysis takes a detailed look at how far, how far the companies that deal with these services could go, the type of contracts that could be drawn up, and whether or not the proposed plan includes an explicit right to go back to work. That is, if the proposed plan includes a provision for a ‘right to use’ or that the employees’ “portfolio” of services would have to be passed by the employer with “consumers” signing up to their ‘portfolios’, the plan is to work out a plan as follows
This is about what the British think of outsourcing and the ‘right to work’, and how the various services that can be created out of those would fit into the profile of the proposed business.
The proposals are designed to address the “right to work” clause in the Immigration Bill that is currently being debated in the U.K. (and is currently facing opposition from the Conservative Party). However the ICO does not suggest that the U.K. Government should go in a single line that encompasses these services. While, from a data point of view, it also doesn’t seem to be as much of a problem if the proposals cover a range of services and rely for some part of the ‘right to work’ to tie the two services together and the ‘right to work’ to cover that part of the business’.
The ICO’s report lists several examples where the service could become relevant to the U.K.’s businesses. For example, one example is a bank account for a UK bank — which could take account, for example, even more a “residence” in the United States.
These are the kind of services that would help take the new framework for financial services more quickly, since it can easily be implemented in smaller organ

 that will allow for all of the content currently produced by Google’s new Creative Labs initiative to go in a new, unified, unified format at the end of this month.
At launch, Google’s new visual search tool can serve as both the primary way to surface and discover content, and it’s also the second largest source of display ads, behind YouTube and Google+.
According to Google’s press release, users making queries using Google’s image searching feature on mobile will start seeing their image files and video files indexed by search results on August 1st in the U.S., and then be indexed at Google.net again on September 8th.
Users will also get a faster update for new content on Google as well, a spokesperson tells us. The site will also now start tracking and ranking the new content, so users can see that their files have already been identified and added to their collections.
The content Google is featuring prominently on its mobile site today is a selection of images found on Google.com with the search engine’s support for these images.
The company had already highlighted the newest content based initiative in its updated release of its redesigned mobile apps last week in the new Google+ Creative Labs section of the mobile versions of all of its products, and now the company is also introducing three new images in its search results as well as search results.
In addition, Google Photos, which Google acquired originally, as a standalone mobile application, continues to offer photo galleries and some interesting new features with the addition of new Google+ categories in its mobile apps.
In addition to the Google+ search updates, you’ll get a new day to week progress bar that lets users know when their photos received updates that syncs back to their Google+ profile instead.
Finally, you can also now search results using more than just Google+ photos when using Google’s new Android search integration. And, of course, Google now offers its own search results with transmuted photos from its desktop, too.
Google is also overhauling its Search’s mobile apps’ now that has gone “lite” in addition to the new Google+ search option.
While some of the initial additions may not be as sexy as some of the more new content found on Google+ alongside its mobile apps as noted above, it’s a far cry smaller update than Google+ itself. Indeed, this month alone, there were only 6 different Google+ search items among 40,000 total search results. But that hardly speaks to Google’s wider efforts to make its Google+ experience more compelling, or to Google’s new efforts to make it more navigable on mobile.
The news of the update comes at the same time that Google appears to be rolling out a remarkable redesign to the Google+ site, which introduced better ways to browse the mobile version of its social network. The idea, Google told me at the time, was to let users “convert their friends” over to the platform more easily.
The new apps’ redesign was just announced, and with this update, Google is now allowing users to more easily browse Google+ on their mobile devices too.
Google has also introduced new mobile-specific “counters.”
In addition to a new Google+ mobile gallery, Google+ has also introduced a new feature called “shared videos.” (No name for this video or the location.) This was first launched on Google TV this week, in partnership with the BBC. The feature is similar to that which Google already offered Android users on desktop, but it is a more complete experience than that, with support for up to four people, and a new “multi-threaded” view, Google has stated this week.
So far, Google+ has also launched a Google+ “catering service” that will let users find and follow restaurants and other businesses. You can view video and add your location, add items, and share your video via the web, and you can also share it on mobile.
Another feature Google introduced in a separate mobile release is support for “fakes,” which is a system that will identify, based on the user, when one person at a restaurant accepts your payment. That way, if it is a dummy or stolen card, the service tries to tell the fake who it is. It has not yet launched yet.
“Today we launched new features in Google+, including food delivery service delivery with Foursquare, and a new “highlighted restaurant recommendation feature” called “discovery suggestions” for restaurants,” a YouTube video explains.
For all these updates, Google’s Android has seen a bump, as highlighted in the above chart. It

 for users to use their phones normally and not for anything else."
"Facebook-owned startup Hearsay Social is announcing a big redesign today, one which lets those on the web or mobile device, as well as Facebook users, chat with those chatting up one another on the service, and vice versa. In other words, the new version (ver. 2.0) allows you to communicate by tapping “like” or “laughing” on posts shared by those that are currently online, or by posting “Like” or “Dislike” ads to posts from those talking up ones offline.
Hearsay Social CEO Emily MacDonald said the service has made the “process of communication more seamless” (though she declined to disclose exact metrics or actives) by allowing both a desktop and mobile app to the new platform.
“It’s a natural evolution of the mobile and desktop experience has allowed us to put the conversation first, and we wanted to make it simple and delightful,” she explained.


In addition, the new website and redesign are optimized for mobile devices including Apple’s iOS and Android frameworks. Apple limits the number of characters you can write on a simple “laser” while on mobile, and limits the number of characters you can add on the web side of the service that goes live next week.
When chatting with someone over the web, you can send them a friend request along with a direct photo or a link for access (via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi), and users can respond with a “like” or “dislike” to the message.
While sharing photos over email is a bit like sharing in person for the first time, MacDonald said the service is now more broadly accessible, with options to chat with people all over the world in addition to those mentioned above.
“Facebook Connect and WhatsApp have changed how our communication works, but these services haven’t really made it across language barriers,” she said.
Although users who’re chatting with friends or family can now send each other “texts” and chat right from the service, Facebook and Messenger also now let you send a private “virtual” hug to someone on Facebook, or send messages to those who’ve never messaged back.
You can also save a message in a group chat by double tapping a friend. And if you share a hug on Slack, your friend is able to see it in a stream and respond directly with a “reaction” to the hug or message.
Now, you’ll also be able to “wink” while chatting with someone over chat, and while watching videos, you’ll be able to see both your reaction and one from the other person. You’ll also be able to see what’s being said and hear those in the video, which will be displayed both on the chat and on the video.

The moves suggest there are of course still enough mobile ways to communicate that it’s difficult to replace traditional cell phone numbers or voice messages, and there are the myriad alternatives. But those that do work – not just apps like WhatsApp, Skype or Viber – are highly competitive in the space. It’s hard to imagine these services being broken out to other platforms, especially given how broad and open these services are."
"As a parent, I couldn’t be more obsessed with my kid’s soccer team. They are amazing, and the whole country is in their sixth year, and I’ll see them win any given game and have a life that I’m pretty proud of for a while. However, soccer is a team sport, and unfortunately, the field is set for that.
Enter GoalSociety, a smartphone app and app that aims to solve that problem of connecting to your favorite soccer player and match up alongside you in a whole new way. The app allows you, or soccer Player X, to message him or her a player, and on the flip side of the app, you can also “celebrate” what you’re seeing in practice.
I’m not sure if I should be impressed or if GoalSociety will be another one to watch in future. I, however, am so happy that they’ve gone out there of this world of possibility and I’m honored to be a part of it. If I were to venture outside of football, I’d have to spend all day with my son’s face, and you can’t ask for a better experience in that world.
The app itself is simple, simple, and straightforward. You just tap on the person you’re messaging and it begins its digital message. You can then add your name, Facebook account, and any other necessary information you would want to let

 Apple the device. The idea is twofold: First, that this can then be a device that is very usable in terms of a productivity, ‘get stuff done’ experience and second, to create a network for users that are connected to each other in the ‘get stuff done’ context.
The network is called an “operating system for the hardware” and comprises a range of connected services. This range includes things like notifications from your phone, the ability to take advantage of fitness trackers (especially those that work with a built-in heart rate monitor and GPS watch), your location, your movement and the ability to receive alerts from other devices, like smart televisions, for example.

The service it wants to build and the network it wants people to use — the operational system, in other words — is the ability to make the ‘get stuff done’ gesture that I mentioned.
What this means is that, instead of having to tap a button on a remote device or try to manually run the phone and launch the app, you are powered by an operating system that is able to take on an open slate to request whatever you need from the phone.
I was unable to create the above map in the above demo manual mode, but it could very well be used for other purposes. For instance, giving people an operating system for their handsets (and other gadgets) to work with certain devices is an idea the team could tackle.
One challenge for any company making a business out of a connected device ecosystem is, of course, ensuring that people aren’t distracted when they are deciding what to wear. And in an era of more and more smartphones there are people who can’t afford to spend much more time and money on something that only works in their limited initial range.  Hence, the team behind this device wants to make sure that devices of all types are accessible to consumers, not least those buying iPhones and Android smartphones, with the aim of building a cohesive and universal user set that’s tailored to specific needs.

The team believes that a future filled with connected devices will be one in which all sorts of “smart” products are on sale, from those being worn by people in everyday life to cars designed to monitor our bodies, homes to smart screens built into smart lamps. They even envision being the basis for a global smart city — the idea being, after all, to be constantly connected to an array of providing the kind of a city that you live, is the core vision. Indeed, they say, that this market will consist of “virtually thousands” of connected products based on the core user need of “wearable solutions” that let consumers manage their connected hardware well.
“The use case for connected devices is a huge shift to an increasingly wearable world, where people not only are able to interact with their world and information through the ‘smart’ devices they own, but are also able to control and direct it,” said Dr Hadi Laghlani, Director of The Future of Health and Interactment at Stanford Lab, in a statement. “We want companies to find the answers to these questions in order to build solutions that drive lasting relationships. This is why the Stanford Lab is sponsoring the Internet of Things Conference to bring together industry leaders in the field of Internet of Things.”
To that end, some IoT device startups are already emerging such as Tado and Elgato, both of which have already made significant moves into the market by combining open IoT with machine learning. Tado specifically, for instance, sells their Connected Elgator smart switches in the form of a bundle of connected switches which will work to automate the installation of Internet of Things devices by enabling various hardware components, thereby generating a “internet of connected devices” — which makes for the logical proposed market for Connected Elgators to become alliance-based (and, implicitly, consumer) buyers of the smart hardware itself.
For the non-trying to sniff a little dust on the connected kettle of gadgets that continue to fill up our digital skies, Connected LED stations make for a very quieter experience tech-wise. But the connected home that’s always out
giving users a choice to connect the connected ones back up — and thereby avoiding the “fail whale” problem of over-complex consumption of multiple IoT devices and/or failing to do so before having to run out of energy

What’s more, Apple is now also trying to get the attention of many of the company’s key demographics. The most recent target of that effort is a group that’s more white users.
But what might they be talking about? The Apple Watch. The smartwatch, which launched in earnest a year ago (and is even more popular than the iPhone, according to data from fancy.com/Apple), has gone way beyond its original offering, and now has the power of social tracking to generate more engagement than just about any device.
According to this data, Apple Watch users are more likely to request a new watch strap after they first take it out. It’s a simple little piece of hardware, and one that Apple is probably still working out a ways down the road.
But even then, one Apple wearable won’t fit all of a company’s needs, leaving a portion of the company’s current team (which is reportedly in the ‘design and development’ phase) with little to no experience handling hardware. It’s also likely something that will get pushed into production, so stay tuned for a statement."
"The Oculus Rift’s virtual reality experience has gotten a bit closer. As the world’s user interface grows more comfortable, the VR experience is getting better and better, and the startup behind it will be more likely to ship in the third quarter of 2016. However, that isn’t the entire story.
Today, the company revealed it had sold 9 million Oculus Rift developer kit over the past two years. The hardware maker, which also bought its brand name for a short period of time, will continue to produce the hardware, as well as expand internationally. As is usual when a company announces multiple projects of one sort, we expect to learn more about the latest news over the next few weeks – we just don’t have enough to fit into our busy schedule.
You can see our new story on Game Informer.com right here based on info from The Verge. The story was written by John Biggs, Chris Velazco, Matt Rogers (and our other anonymous tipster), so be sure to jump to that article for everything."
"The TechCrunch New Series Folding Pad is a device that I originally thought was a Kickstarter for the iPhone. It acts as a sort of “smart keyboard,” helping you type faster and faster, especially in the busy work spaces in our office. But the unique feature is its simple design, which features all the same button/trackpad/etc. keys plus speaker.
The Pad uses Bluetooth and an NFC protocol to connect to your Mac (an iPhone 3GS with Bluetooth 3.0+), iPad (An iOS 8 accessory), iPhone (iPhone 3GS with 4.0+), or any other Bluetooth capable device (iPad or any other iOS device with Bluetooth). It features wireless charging, giving you more than 1,200mAh in total, and 2.5x that of the Apple keyboard (though the pad has been known to generate noise on quiet streets). It’s compatible with Android and Windows.
A pad is a great feature if you’re used to using a notebook computer. But when it comes to useability, the Pad is not what I’d call usable, as you could only fit the two USB keys and optical smart trackpad within the space bar that resides below the home button. It also lacks iOS gestures, like a shortcut to jump right into your application without having to enter your Apple ID information or any special security information, like you could on a custom home button.
The Pad is designed to fit in your office on either an iPad or iPhone and comes in either black or white, with options for both in-room or in an out-door format. It works with the existing pressure-sensitive home keys and, with its wireless connectivity, with a dedicated touch-key that features a simple number on the top above the space bar. The app itself is free but if you’re looking for more options and support, check out the TechCrunch Apple Tip: I like the Pad better than an official pad, if only because of its headphone jack.
I’m told the team has been working on additional content for the Pad over the course of the year, all created by artists and designers in a collaboration with a handful of folks from the area.
The Pad will be available to order now at 3PixiArt.com to start and ship early next year in the U.S."

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 the company will be in a position soon to enter the consumer market with new software products, but as long as it keeps at it, its product strategy will include iterating on existing ones to improve the user experience. So, the software product, when it becomes available, will be part of the puzzle, the process for which has proven difficult for many to get caught up on.
The key is to sell into consumers at that level they feel comfortable with the software, so if you’re not selling into one particular vendor, and you’re going after consumers at that level, and you’re offering something that goes beyond X-plus-Y, it’s much more difficult. We also have to compete with the other guys on that journey, and with the growing tendency to wear down the boundaries — with wearables in particular — from consumer perception standpoint. And we’re very confident we can win once we get the software out there and everybody begins wearing it and starts to feel comfortable with it. That’s much more difficult than it might sound, and it’s much more difficult than it sounds to sell into someones mind.
TC: How do you sell into consumers?
ML: Right now, we’re going straight to the source of the customer. What are we trying to sell to the consumer? We have two angles to go after. The first is to go to the consumers themselves. We try to sell to the average person, rather than asking them to download an app, but then we ask them,” is what I’m referring to.
The other angle then is the companies that can build software, so we’re targeting the entire company at the moment in this instance. Once the app is available and functioning well, this is great for consumers and once it’s truly done we don’t have a lot more work ahead of us getting them to be excited about it.
TC: How popular is the app at this point? Which are the different features which appear most popular amongst the wider user? Which appear to be the most popular of the more popular offerings?
ML: There are three really different things. The first one is we didn’t release a version of the app, we really put it out there to let people learn and explore. That was the first version, and what they did the beta version was similar to what’s available now, and then we added in features like Maps, and then we did the app. So it’s kind of a collection of things we’ve been doing for the last 4 to 5 months, and we’re now starting to really release features onto the market so that’s kind of cool as far as what’s hot and fresh. We definitely want to make the app better, but I can’t think of a single feature that’s going to break the app stores for anyone.
TC: Talk a bit about what you were doing when you were pitching this earlier. Which of course you were? It seems like you’re trying to solve the problem of discovery, but have been very effective — so how did you pitch the right person at the right time?
ML: Well we started out with an app that was very similar to Finds, but then we added in features like map and then that, and then we started to think about really how much we’ve been able to build this over the last two years to deliver really high-quality functionality that everyone can expect. So we had a team working with us every step of the process from idea to implementation to really getting the app out to consumer. And then, once we felt ready to do more things and really push the app out as hard as possible to some people, eventually we did launch an early version of the application on October 27th of last year. And that was it.
TC: Who is your ideal customer? Which startup? Which one? Which feature are they most likely to try and which one they ‘bored’ about and why?
ML: We have three targets right now that we really can’t get any less of right now, and we wanted to pick the most popular ones at the moment. The app itself is free and as I’m telling you that’s the first application we’ve done anything with, and we’re building out the brand. And then, beyond that, what they’re looking for right now is to be able to be super aggressive in making sure that we’re delivering the best version of the products that they’re asking for. So it might be different than what they want and what’s hot and fresh right now.
TC: Why did you choose this date? It’s not like ‘cause it’s Wednesday’…A lot of the early user data has been skewed towards people

One of the big selling points for Snapjoy is that it uses a combination of optical and WiFi-enabled hardware, so you don’t need to have an existing WiFi network to use the service (which is a $5.99 annual subscription plus $13.99 a month). Since most of what it offers is only video, other uses of streaming apps including Spotify and Netflix, as well as Wi-Fi, are still more expensive.
Even so, it’s still a viable way to get a sense for what the kids are watching on Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Hulu, HBO Go, iNxtra, Amazon’s iPlayer and others.
Snapjoy is also working to add some more social features to the app, as they’re still investigating another issue with streaming video apps of late, like the “Likes” approach some have taken to address, where users were once able to leave a review on a service’s service before they actually watched it.
The app is currently iOS-only, but Android was in development.
The app is available here on the iTunes App Store."
"The average person has hundreds of digital games on their phone, and it can be a challenge for those of us who don’t have the patience for those games to sell, which are often expensive. Now a company called Fathom Media is looking to channel those gaming costs into an app called Moov and it has just began its public beta.
When I first met co-founder and CEO Brandon Evans over the weeks and months before Fathom’s launch, he emphasized the app’s cross-platform capabilities. “Game developers can take an account to monetize in this fashion,” he explained.
The system is focused on gamification as well. Instead of trying to force the user to do something ridiculous, the system encourages users to make fun of themselves and make achievements on the leaderboards.

Once a gamer completes their achievement, they’re given challenges. Then, when players compete to see who first, the two-fold revenue model continues. When the top scorer is crowned the overall leader in their particular category, they are awarded virtual currency.

“We’re not forcing people to do anything,” Evans said. “You can be whatever you want on the platform.”
Fathom has a mobile play, too. So there’s a mobile version, too, and with more expansions to come, the hope is to reach players more who like to play online. The longer answer would be to build tools for developers, too, like Fathom’s mobile functionality.
The app is live today in the Apple App Store for the mobile game. More will be made available at a later time at Moov’s own website."
"There’s a big shift taking place at Evernote and elsewhere today: a big slowdown in consumers using their phones for intensive work tracking, but a big acceleration by businesses wanting better intelligence tools to manage and act on that data.
That’s why IBM-owned Asana is announcing a new partnership with IBM. As part of that, IBM will build a suite of tools specifically focused on helping companies manage the complex data load of their staff. The first product, codenamed IBM ProductCloud, is going to be released in the coming months.
As part of the deal, IBM has recruited three former senior executives from Atasq, IBM’s product manager for Internet Service, who will be working as part of the IBM ProductCloud partnership.
The partnership comes less than two months after Google brought in two new executives to help it accelerate its own cloud development. And there are many other startups in the cloud space as well, including Google Cloud, Microsoft, Oracle and more — there is IBM’s Cloud Stack, for example, which has had its own cloud revolutionized by a big move away from its main cloud, Power BI. So IBM has some ground to make up — it just recently launched its largest cloud platform to date and it’s not clear what its plans will be going forward.
IBM tells me that it will be developing tools for developers that will specifically address the issues of how to manage the complexity of cloud apps using the apps built by Asana — specifically how people managing large numbers of tasks need a good way to set up an app to work where that will work.
IBM, too, will use its tools to help with the data management, specifically that which comes through in the cloud in relation to its business customers.
IBM will also

 he had to use “this moment” to be a part of her.
It is very simple… Just pick a cover story. Tell a short one. But the heart is always in the middle. In fact, I prefer to read the long-saying short ones… Especially the longer, thoughtful essays.
Now, I need to be able to take this moment and share it with people who will read it. And I can’t. Even though it’s just for reading, it’s incredibly powerful. You can share this moment and it’s not just for reading. I can’t. I think of it differently from the past. It’s not just for the moment. There’s time, presence, and intention.
Even more importantly, I can’t. Why would you want to be a part of my moment?
You never quite know it’s in front of your eyes. It’s the very center of people’s awareness of self-worth is what keeps it so simple. That’s why you have no sense of time or care. Self-actualization begins once you feel you have a sense of self-worth, then it really starts to take off — or you feel you want to be in more places and you start to see other people with it, then it’s more likely to spread. And people with it start showing it.
You don’t have time to just sit back and wait for the next moment. You get up and get more and more ambitious. Your mind, body, and even your hands and legs are getting tired. It’s hard to stay with everything in your world. Why not just pay attention and do this now? It just doesn’t feel good enough to put someone to sleep.
So I start writing. And I’m writing it.
I don’t know, maybe not in my mind, but writing is my first major experiment. No one ever writes a blog post and it’s just not the easiest idea to digest. I wrote this on my phone, and it was about 15 minutes before I was going to sleep. I did it.
People are going to find different ways to express themselves through creativity, and creativity should emerge at the same time. I don’t know about that part of the brain but if you feel like telling a story, telling yourself stories or letting our world know that I’m thinking of it… we can share our moment.
This is really where technology is going to help in real estate. I’ve been working for a long time on the iPad, and we use it as a way to communicate. It’s a beautiful way to share something. But there’s no easy way to share a moment. It’s like a game in a real world. This app reminds me so often I had to wonder if I was being selfish or right. There are all these limitations and I want to be creative, and use technology to do this.
Now, I’m not sure what all those limits are. It’s not really an “app” in Ibottle. It’s something I am doing in my head. And I feel like it really resonates with the way people think about reality, how they think about it. So I’ll keep using it until it really gets to the size. Then I’m going to the toilet. “The second they find something they’re so in love with, they start thinking more and then they start exploring that.” Oh, oh, and then I get in love with the thing I invented. Yeah.

"Ameyo, the digital health startup co-founded by former Y Combinator partner and current Motilo investor Sam Altman, has launched a health and fitness app targeted at tracking food consumed at home, meal eaten, or calories, which will make it easy for users to take action without having to fiddle with different menu combinations while they keep an eye on their food and exercise logs. Altman explained that, ultimately, the focus of their app is the small, simple act of eating and measuring every calorie you consume, not you eating the calories. Ameyo’s app is designed to track food you consume in the home, and is already being used by a number of companies, including Fitbit and Fitocracy, but it has not been available to consumers until now – thanks to the new funding.
Altman explains that one of the biggest problems it is trying to solve is the huge amount of data required to work out if a user is in a low-health mode that is missing important information from their fitness program, or if they’re out of luck and don’t know what to eat for the

f and we have a team of engineers that make it as seamless as possible.”
It looks like on the software side, Evernote looks to have a major impact on the kind of data you could get from a traditional resume.
“We have been talking to LinkedIn about a partnership, some days ago, they were talking about a partnership with LinkedIn where they could integrate these types of services,” he said. “We’ve been planning that for a while. We’ve been working on it for a while.”
This means not only is it happening — and Evernote will need to have a team working on it, too — but the new hires will bring a whole new level of experience to what Evernote is doing. Some of the ideas are more around the user experience, including how they might better explain how to use the product to get new users on the site, and how they could better make LinkedIn more of a referral and career resource than a job-specific site.
But in the bigger picture how they shape the landscape of job-seekers today, they get a lot of attention from recruiters: they know they will be accused of the same thing when it comes to their professional success and success at the same time.
That is to say that they come up with different views that would be pertinent to a company’s aims — and they are, after all, competing for talent. But there’s a lot of potential to pull jobs away from big, established companies, or from the more open-minded ones competing for business (as they have been many times over the last few years).
Whether this is the right board to get them to play in that world is a different question, but the way they are approaching this new project should help keep an eye open for any suggestions as to whether an acquisition is a good option or a bad one.
Evernote tells us that it is now working on a new, yet-to-be-launched personal finance product — one which will use the same engine to allow those already tracking their finances to get an idea of where their money is best and where their cashflow is most likely to next.
In any event the new ideas will be coming along way from the team of 30, and they will expect to have an engineering team (not just those focused on building applications) working on it in the next three months.
“We have a team dedicated to the idea, but have decided to focus on building some pretty specific use cases first,” he said. “To be as broad as possible, we still expect to get a lot more in on.”
The idea, the spokesperson continued, is to enable the team to focus on what it’s best for that person to do at a company whose core product is financial management, which it would obviously benefit from an intelligent board-focused view than its current, and is one reason why it has spent months developing something that is very practical and useful across a board.
It’s definitely a strategy that is in keeping with the company’s larger overarching focus of being the world’s digital footprint. Evernote doesn’t need to give up its position as a traditional personal investment institution (and personal wealth) quickly to acquire startups, and certainly isn’t interested in highting startups anytime by letting them know that it is actively interested in picking up their attention."
"Twitter has confirmed with me that it will introduce a new feature for journalists to access it’s recently launched Search API called “Help.”
Twitter confirmed it will also have a new search feature, which includes a set of steps that enable people to search for specific search terms, without entering in the source. The company says these search results can include a person, account, hashtag, link, status update, or just a person’s public profile, as well as an image in a tweet or tweet, or even an image search.
I don’t think I’d ever use the search option on Twitter to search for the @Us API’s profile, but here we have a chance to see the results we’ve been searching for by opening the “Help” section in the search page.  It was one of its many big successes this year.
The search feature should allow users to search for a specific search term, as well as search around a specific person or account, without going to the person’s @Us@Us Twitter account.
Twitter’s search functionality is especially helpful to journalists and marketers who, because of Twitter’s huge popularity among journalists, have a more direct way of searching for specific tweets

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 the startup actually started out as a company called Cogito. While Facebook needed a new photo-sharing site to appeal to its more mature and mature user base, Instagram emerged as a more spontaneous sort of social network.
The company is now looking to grow up as more of a “Facebook for teenagers” than a real-time photo-sharing service that attracts users. This is especially in view as the company continues to try to increase engagement for young people on Facebook. Instagram recently announced a slew of content partnerships.
Of course, this is all well and good until Instagram suddenly gets too popular, or gets a cute new name, or does something funny. The company also needs to figure out how to retain its original user base while also becoming a viable, independent business.

By focusing on growth, Instagram can keep users engaged and coming back to the app while doing so, and with less pressure to monetize, the company also has a lot of options.
If Instagram is going to continue to grow its user base and move beyond being a “real-time news source,” that doesn’t make sense. Even though users don’t have to register for accounts to start following the Instagrammers, that user pool is still very small, and if the platform can really put that to the test of user retention (and really fast growth in the app), it may be able to become profitable in a way Instagram never could."
"As we’ve learned from startups in the past, there is a pretty good market for messaging and messaging apps after Instagram and WhatsApp. The gap between the two is largely a gap between markets, too. There are tens of billions of products aimed toward those particular verticals for businesses. While it’s been a slow and deliberate shift in the world of app development, it’s still happening. Today, Bazaarvoice — the messaging app/messaging market leader that recently moved $30 million in funding from Chinese investors — is announcing that it has raised $100 million. It is the largest single round of funding the company has raised since starting out in 2008.
The round was led by GGV Capital with participation from its existing investors in Tengelmann Ventures, New York Angels and Kleiner Perkins. (The round also included the participation from GGV Capital as well as new strategic investment from Tenaya Capital in India.) This is the largest to date and brings the total raised by Bazaarvoice to $132.4 million.
When we last wrote about Bazaarvoice, it was mostly focused on international expansion and in the Bayesian sense, the company’s biggest market outside of North America and Europe. Today, Bazaarvoice — which started out as an e-commerce-like service — is often used more in a consumer-to-consumer mobile, consumer-to-consumer apps like, Twitter, Instagram and Instagram. It started out initially by providing access to some 8 million free international calls, and then, when CEO Greg Badros showed us the app last week as part of the opening a new international base in Australia, it became a larger company as well. Over time, the company had around 700,000 paying customers around the world — a figure that’s now expanded, Bazaarvoice says.
The new funding will help the company expand internationally, both into new markets and also into new apps, Bazaarvoice said in a separate press statement, “primarily for India and Southeast Asia, two markets not covered by its current footprint.”
The company has been making a great effort to invest in local services to keep its app and business growing even if it sometimes shows some traction abroad. That includes international expansions in Australia and the UK, the company said yesterday; an expansion to South Korea, which launched last month; and more recent moves like the appointment of Google’s India vice president Rakesh Varma.
In particular, Bazaarvoice has focused primarily around creating software and services for local businesses — a route that many other companies have taken in particular, but sometimes with very little visibility. Other notable developments have come in the form of an acquisition of Vevo and several international expansions in the German market, Canada and Spain.
Update: One of the questions being asked on this funding round is whether Bazaarvoice plans to expand beyond the geographic focus that it has today. “We look forward to growing our business further in a global way,” the company said in statement.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 recruit and train the next salesperson by showing them this pitch. You know it’s just your way of selling more sales without these cumbersome side steps. In an article just posted on TechCrunch, a startup is already looking to help with this, and is now hiring sales people just to use the program.
The startup itself was founded by Ryan Singleton and COO John Love, who wanted a better way to handle sales training. Love worked in sales for a while, founding The Social Marketing Company in 1998, when he left and started Workday in 2004. He brought on Steve Schlafman (a former vice president of sales for PeopleSoft), Charles Krugelowski (previously at Salesforce and Salesforce.com), Steve Irving (previously at Salesforce or Salesforce), and Alex Malafeev (previously at Salesforce, Salesforce.com, and LinkedIn).
For background, Love wrote a book about the subject for the book and is now on a speaking tour for Microsoft Learning to give it a shout on Amazon. Singleton’s background in sales and marketing goes back nearly four decades and he’ll know his way around sales and operations.
The idea with this new program is that Salesforce will be able to pull together much more data about how people are reacting to the content and more about sales training. They could also potentially get more accurate data on how people are really performing when they have a question on a point that they can’t answer (e.g. “What are the benefits of this new product?” or “How are we losing customers?”).
The final piece will be predictive analytics that the sales team will already know and will show them to the sales team to help them answer those questions.
Singleton says that Salesforce is already working with some sales reps who are using Sift, and you can run these types of requests for sales reps, too: “You can actually run these campaigns on Salesforce. That’s the secret sauce that it’s all about,” he said in an interview.
For now the company is still working through the initial rollout with the first customers, including Brick+Mart, Catering.com, and Martha Stewart. But the team is working with various customers around the world and it’s adding new sales reps as it goes.
The first pilot program for example is in the Philippines, but the hope is to partner with local governments and large enterprises to expand this locally-focused product (and eventually beyond) in new countries.
The first step, Singleton says, is to work with a large and international customer base. He mentioned a number of places where Salesforce can already work with governments and large enterprises locally, so that they can be proactive and inform their sales team and teams about the program (and perhaps also how they can actually apply it themselves).
There’s also going to be a series of APIs out in the field as well that Salesforce is working with, meaning that if a brand can build functionality to their existing offerings, they can also get sales reps into the program, too (and then Salesforce could charge based on the value they bring in the form of this product.)
Singleton is optimistic about how those types of tools, which he stresses will be very valuable only if this product really takes off, will be available widely. “The reason I invest in Salesforce is because it allows us to do more good than we’ve ever done previously,” he said. “This company is about helping the world a better way by finding good solutions and that’s what resonates.”
In the meantime, he’s going to work with his new business in recruiting. When quizzes and tests are coming to recruiters, Singleton says that Salesforce will be the biggest beneficiary from this effort, and he expects Salesforce will continue to be a strong player when it comes to helping sales reps understand this program and why it’s important.
“I don’t know if I’ve seen any other recruitment companies out there in general, and even if I have — and I don’t know if anyone’s doing this — everyone to me is just based on the paycheck,” Singleton says. “We are the first one” to try to understand this, because of this great thing about Salesforce.”"
"There has been a new CEO, a new board and a host of events, and we’ve heard a fair bit about what’s going on at the top of the “Top 20 Most Interesting Companies” list at The Hive for the last year. So, is this “Nest?” Is that something we need more of the new Nest?
We discuss all of these things and more on January 24, at 5:30pm

 keep the number of partners down to four from five. They also set up a system for users to alert them if there are any suspicious activity — such as, for example, a customer service representative sending a message to many people in the same area. The plan is to continually beef up this system while keeping an eye on any suspicious activity and the number of people affected by it. So far the programme has only been successful with regard to the initial targeting, with 60% of the current user-base being in Europe, and with “several thousand” users in the U.S., but with potentially much bigger plans on the longer term, says Pieterkerk.
The core Kibrella technology will be open sourced but will remain a proprietary piece and not sell to end-users. The aim is to work within enterprise organizations, such as banks, government organizations and consultants, to build an ecosystem of interest amongst partners where data and analytics is shared alongside other things like marketing and sales channels.
“We see this as basically a platform play, where the majority of the data and analytic work is taking place. A large enterprise like Barclays, for example, has an internal management team that oversees the way they are doing all of the [financial] things. And there is more of a focus on things that directly impact the business. We are open to that,” he adds.
The early bird pricing for the Kibrella platform starts at 99 euros per user and scales up from there at 300 euros per user .
“Our users — Barclays and many others besides — have a need for auditing and really tight control and how they want to deal with things. So we were thinking more directly how can we provide that information? How can they be more effective? How can they be more open to how the business is performing and what the customers really want to see.”
“I’m part of the first generation that this can happen,” adds Pieterk. “There are companies today that are established and have many, many, many teams of analysts.”
“With this the problem we are trying to address — the non-executive management, like a lot of people in executive departments, have a need to get information up front and use this information to make better decisions. But the problem today — and this is a problem that these teams, these executives that we see — they don’t really have time to sit down and talk to the people who are outside who are inside the organisation and how they can better help them.
“Their job is to use information gathering techniques, methods like calling in analysts but also data sourcing techniques. And there we give them a team to get it up front so that the whole company gets their own analytics tools from within the team and then you disseminates it across the whole organization and you get insights and you have reports that are used by key decision makers internally to make a better decision,” he adds.
To that end, to aid the use of all this new analytics, the platform offers three products: analytics dashboard, infographics dashboard, and an integrated report for analysts.
“In order to bring all of this together we are actually integrating each of them instead of replacing them,” adds Pieterk. “In the analytics, we already have our own dashboard and we have an inbuilt analytics dashboard which integrates into the email, we have a custom dashboard to make it easy for people to enter new user information into their dashboards automatically. And then we create reports and then we are adding new analytics using the data, but if it’s not live (or we don’t have data) we can also pull it off automatically, which we then we have embedded into the analytics dashboard.
“On the analytics side we already have customized reports. If you are running a campaign on Facebook or Google you already know how you are getting users using this service. And then you want to know how you are getting them and how you might be able to be able to stop them from doing this.” 
Kibrella also offers marketers one anonymized report on how they are doing; users can opt out of sharing it. “We have the aggregate for now very simple — we call it the stock dashboard and we will add in more dashboards with different topics and different analytics that will be available to us now,” adds Pieterk.
On the marketing side, Kibrella can automate workflows and also draw out custom reports — with a range of models for both internal communication and external outreach.
Kibrella is not disclosing the terms of the partnership. It will work with multiple companies depending on whether it’s in-house enough to deliver a user base;

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 before a competitor called Flyin had raised a total of $500,000 in seed funding to begin developing its own mobile-to-mobile solution.
In that year, Uber found a perfect home among an industry with very different needs.
The company began work on what would become UberConference, an iOS and Android app that connects drivers with consumers who want to meet with a group of people in the same room in a digital call center. UberConference has continued to grow steadily but with a different model since then. Now, the company uses its own experience and expertise to connect drivers without having to talk to a server, a server of course, but ultimately the goal is to reach drivers as soon as possible and allow customers to connect through an app.
But UberConference has been nearly completely closed up in recent months. The company hasn’t released any update since May when CEO Travis Kalanick took over in a new president role. But the company has recently shown signs of restarting the business. In January of last year, the company revealed it had grown to 50 employees and now its driving around in a “live office.”
Today, it reported on its blog that its conference had reached over 10 million attendees on its platform, to provide a total of 11.8 million total rideshare time to date. In addition there are 6,000 drivers and 1.8 million riders attending each session, but there remains a need for more riders, given a lack of riders in the United States.
That’s why Kalanick has been focusing on providing a solution for those without riders in the United States, which is what he sees on the business-to-business front. “We are looking forward to a day when our customers can just go on the UberConference app and connect to a group of people waiting behind them in an UberConference session,” he said last week in a statement today announcing a new service focused on carpooling.
It’s this kind of “UberConference Carpooling” service that I would imagine is seen more widely in the market than a service that lets business owners manage the need of their employees, but is also the case here — specifically for drivers who may be feeling tired and more comfortable with some of these addressing industry needs.
“You can have companies like IBM, AT&T and Cisco, with 60 global businesses, providing carpooling services to their employees,” the company writes. “This is a big market — so this is what UberConference can do; this is a big investment for us; and we love learning about the needs of this industry.”
We are already seeing signs of at least one of these companies getting interested in helping the startup — which today reported on its blog, is seeing revenue growth of 60-80 per cent, per session, but what’s not known, what UberConference claims, is how many rides the app has already facilitated since its launch in February.
The company said its service has been “experienously successful” — with 1,500 people now using its platform to get cars, get carpoolers and engage in other activities.
This, UberConference argues, is testimony to the market that, while carpooling may have initially seemed like a novelty to those of us who think that sharing our journeys on sites like Twitter — or on our smartphones — isn’t exactly a big business, it’s a potentially huge market for carpooling, and one UberConference hopes that is, by getting some of these people engaged, will lead to more referrals of carpooling or other services.
Or as one of those on-the-road marketing slogans goes, “what we’re building, and what people are sharing, is the future of travel. Come join our caravan!”"
"There are a lot of startup ideas in the world today. Some we hear the wrong sorts at the right time, some were invented and are just not practical… Some are really too expensive. There’s too much choice to make a decision.
One area of opportunity that’s really ripe for disruption: your phone’s notifications.
The reason? The fact that so many smart devices — and their creators, to boot — have taken over the mobile environment (from being typically utilitarian, a bit like how desklamps or smart watches work) has had a terrible impact on how you use your device for various activities.
We have already seen notifications being shoved down our throats and we do want to be more proactive in alerting the software on our phones that it’s time to take the plunge. (Or in the case of things like the latest iPhone iPhone and the

 the new financing, as well as its expansion into European markets — currently covering 35 countries — from mid-September.
The news comes just one month after a $20 million round led by Chinese financial institution Naveen Venture Partners, according to VentureBeat, which reported that this round includes participation from Chinese investor Zhang Qiangdong. It’s now alleged that Alibaba is in the process of raising a later $100 million round of funding from the VC firm, perhaps as soon as next year.
Alibaba and Naveen declined to comment on the funding rumors. Alibaba has been very quiet but has a number of investments announced over the last several months. It revealed that it led a $300 million Series C round in a Chinese video firm, QQiyi, in February; and in June it led a $2.5 billion share acquisition in Chinese taxi app cab rival Kuaidi Dache in its biggest city, Shanghai.
Naveen and Alibaba were among those backing the Alibaba investment fund. And even as Alibaba reported a slowing share price of $28.07 on Wednesday, it invested in NQaim, a firm that is in turn backed by Alibaba founder Jack Ma.
It’s interesting that the timing of this news is interesting because the two are very different companies. Alibaba was born in 1995 and is currently valued at $215.5 billion. As an investment fund, Naveen and Alibaba are well-positioned to capitalize on the momentum of Alibaba’s meteoric rise in sales. Alibaba’s most recent founders are the two top-earliest entrepreneurs at a company that, for the most part, is not selling products, but instead is trying to build its own ecosystem of e-commerce services that have the most potential but also few customers.
This will be Alibaba’s first acquisition outside of China. But Naidum has made an incredible career building Internet businesses in China, where it has a history of investing in top internet companies from early on. Naiduma co-founder, Yang Tong, was founding Ctrip when Alibaba was a tiny dot-com in 2010. He was later involved in two Internet businesses acquired by Chinese Internet giants Tencent and Baidu as part of a $3.5 billion funding round by Alibaba earlier this year. The firm was an early investor in China’s top e-commerce companies, which it recently bought for $1.2 billion and its financial portfolio includes Ubergo, China’s Uber rival.
Niantic acquisition of Pokémon Go fills out the circling opportunities for Alibaba in China. It can further expand its role in the country, and this could help extend Alibaba’s brand and power more effectively.
This investment comes at the same time as a report, uncovered by the Wall Street Journal, that China’s InstaID service, which was launched in 2016 and is a part of the Chinese government’s mobile payment project, is one of the most important tools to help users pay bills, and possibly collect money from service providers, card holders and more. This is especially important for the Communist Party, which has been pushing hard to promote its government-issued digital payment system, and has also been making a move away from banks.
We’ll have to wait until the company has more information to provide on that front for now."
"Samsung has announced its next-generation Galaxy Gear smart watch at both Samsung Unpacked 2014 event and today at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, though the Gear is being previewed in many ways, the Gear itself (or the Gear VR headset you can use, which is coming to Europe and elsewhere) is being kept relatively under wraps — though the Gear will be debuted at the event in time.
Samsung’s original Gear VR headset was unveiled last October, and the company began sending out a handful of developer kits to a select group of test buyers and developers — including some 3,500 of the initial developer kit, and “thousands” of the “starter kits,” along with an SDK and developer tools. There’s also been a big uptick in new developer activity in terms of companies, both in Korea and abroad — Samsung notes that more than 300 companies, both big and small, are using its new VR headset worldwide.
Of course there are scores of “cool” gadgets that the Gear VR can be used with, and developers have taken notice of this. The Verge was first to report that the smartwatch appeared to come from developer sources — a source close to one of the companies that actually produced the Gear VR said the company was working on a “much larger batch.” And the company seems to be paying

,, and the more they’re made aware of how much content out there.
“This has been an attempt for us to look into why people consume content on the web, because it’s largely a business question, but if you focus only on the data, they’re reading the news the most, and eating the most, and watching the most,” explains Fongla. “At this point, over the last five years, we’re collecting 3 billion pieces of content in the U.K. every single day.”
The U.K. has some pretty good news protection under Article 27 — as I noted in my prior coverage of the legislation here — and while Fongla mentions some of the limitations and “complexity” of the current Data Protection Act, the new requirement set out a path for businesses to set up systems to restrict access to “relevant content”, including content that could be used “to help them deal with the demands of this growing problem of unruly consumption.”
“It’s a very expensive problem to solve. Businesses have been putting in a huge amount of effort to make sense of the data they’re getting, and we’re trying to reduce the barriers to doing so by getting rid of complexity,” Ghanesh points out.
In practice, this means that you could (for example) create a “disconnect” (a concept being defined in this instance as a link that is not made if a user is logged in, “not engaging” or “can no longer access relevant content”) that wouldn’t work if someone were to go into someone’s information and found relevant information they wanted to share.
Another example he gives is social media. “It’s not the social media. It’s the email, the social network message. If you put a person in a location where they’re going, you need to take action. When that action is important to you and someone starts to consume it in real time… You need to have an ‘opt in’ system for social media so people’s going to have to be aware of these threats, these new forms of cyber attack.”
In that sense, when you put in a link that’s not really a ‘click’ — say a story about a friend who’s being an alcoholic. Or a link about a particular branch of the Internet that you want to subscribe to. “All those links are going to be served to people regardless of who they are that are not relevant to their relationships,” says Fongla.
The new requirement — taking into account “a proper introduction” — is designed to “take your thinking to the Internet”, he argues. Not that it’s a bad thing, but more so it’s a complex one to grapple with. But the complexity also means there’s scope for error and unintended exposure (which isn’t exactly ideal when there are 100,000 different ways to share something, according to this UK website)… So if your link is a ‘click’, and you’re the only one, well sorry that’s just what you, and not your friends.
How does the new requirement work exactly, I asked? Fongla and his team did a small internet survey among 100 random U.K. members of the public — which is apparently a representative sample of 4,000 people —  to understand how people are interpreting the new requirements. More broadly they found that 60 per cent of people don’t understand what a ‘click’ is and how it can be used ( 20 per cent seemed clueless while another 40 per cent seemed confused or believed it was a ‘click’).
They also asked 2,000 single people to complete the same internet survey and told them they will be fine with sharing links that aren’t ‘clickable’. They also said they understood that requiring a website with a click requirement might be considered a ‘black box’ and that many people don’t understand the technicalities of the new system.
“A lot of people are concerned [about the ‘click’ requirement],” says Fongla. “They do understand it but they also feel that it’s unfair that they’re treated as if they’re not being very proactive about how their connections or their connections are being used.”
The team also asked the opinion of random internet users who have signed up but gave it a second thought. They asked one woman, who decided to share her name only with us because she was afraid of being seen as a “crazy internet user”, how

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
“What we’re seeing is the first of many,” says David. “Crowdfunding is now starting to make a splash more in the enterprise, not only in hardware but software. We have seen Kickstarter get much faster, more streamlined, and the whole ecosystem just started to take off for the first time.”
The company originally launched out of the Y Combinator class at the beginning of the year, followed by the summer run of 100 applications. That batch, in order, was chosen over a two week long process — which, if you were there, is like having four seasons worth of experience.

With the new funding, the company was able to take advantage of this better early run and get access to a wider set of customers without having to expand too quickly. “We were able to go on our original mission for 10 weeks without having to go out to pitch every single person,” David says. “And here we are, in three years total, our first year out, where we have such a big number of customers.”
While it’s early, there are a number of enterprise software companies that might not have had a chance to reach the $100 million figure for revenue that they’re currently in the process of tracking, and that’s something that Ollipot has been able to help it to handle due to its team’s work with existing enterprise customers. “It works like a dream,” David notes when asked what customers are looking for.

The platform goes beyond what Ollipot offers today, however. Ollipot also uses enterprise branding, to make the process of sharing documents between teams happen faster, quicker, and with a more direct focus. And that, according to David, makes for some real-time collaboration. That is, as you edit something and send it to a colleague, you can see it on their device.
The idea is to present the documents after the sharing to their destination (and, crucially, in the cloud). That’s an interesting twist on sharing files in the cloud today where people access them in their native format (in PDFs, Excels, etc.) and not converted for web use.
Also not unlike other “intro to enterprise” startup or early mover Inboxd, the company has been busy building a number of cloud-based CRM applications, some major, and others small. Currently, 10 apps live, with a further three dozen ready to go.
Although not all of these apps will be going live in the near future, there are scores of documents and files that live in Ollipot’s cloud — some of which Ollipot is not sharing publicly, according to David. This includes things like an iPhone document that is sent from the workplace to the IT department, a patent application, an application for a patent suit, a contract from a third party to implement it, a patent application, an E-Dated Sheet, an abstracted patent, and more.
In a demo earlier this week, David showed me another document from Ollipot, a contract from a second-party company that he’s had in his Dropbox account for years, and as I added it up, the file was being synced successfully in under 20 minutes.
Currently in private beta, the service sees signups among “hundreds of companies,” according to David. Its pricing is not set in stone yet, but they are working on it now for revenue generation purposes. Ollipot plans to charge for the app, starting somewhere higher than per-per-line in the region of $15 to $20 per monthly or per-seat per month.
What’s interesting is that, of all the products that Ollipot is bringing together, I have to imagine that at some point after getting on board with several of these things, Ollipot will then see fit to launch a subscription service.
As it stands today, though, it seems there is some value in the work that Ollipot is doing, and there will be. The company is working to become more of a solution in these situations than it is a platform provider, and more of a tool provider, if that’s really the case.
As for why the move to become a “cloud platform” company, it’s a natural progression. With the shift to the cloud, it’s harder and harder for large organizations to keep their business information private without being attacked for being breached. The bigger players like EMC were at the forefront of this shift, and, while it’s understandable why these large organizations were interested, the cloud has become a much easier way to administer these types of sharing solutions for their large organizations and those like them. A cloud-based company, with one

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 the new version of Facebook for smartphones released last week (Android launcher, not Facebook app) has already been downloaded nearly 200,000 times since launching in October 2012. So it’s certainly not a massive increase in app downloads per se, just a more indicative of overall usage. It’s worth noting that usage spikes are not a bad thing – users are spending an inordinate amount of time on apps on their phones which most of their time applying social graphs and other services to friends’ stories.
“We know that most people love interacting with others online – but we also know that apps get people more involved, sharing more, “feeling their emotions” than anything else. So that app usage is an important indicator of someone’s true Facebook usage.”"
"In this month’s Q2 earnings call, analyst Dominic Sun compared mobile content to a typical cost-per-install model for mobile. The analyst’s data suggested the average cost per install for app purchases will be around $3.42, up from $1.95 this year.
Sun was speaking to a panel of analysts from IDC, who were also asked for their views on Facebook’s mobile strategy.
Despite the fact that the consumer web is still so large, reaching more than one billion users, the majority of revenue still arrives from mobile — so Facebook won’t see a huge affreshment in its share price.
“We are focused on the monetization opportunity on mobile and what our growth looks like in the next three to five years,” he said.
“Our growth looks quite high, which is a good sign for the first quarter this year because it shows consumers are getting accustomed to these things… It’s also good news for Facebook’s growth. For one, it’s the highest quarterly earnings as a company in its history.”
The analyst also suggested Facebook should be considering how it can generate revenues from mobile — either charging for a free version of its mobile apps, or selling third-party apps via a pay channel if it is going down the route of an ad-based revenue model. However, this revenue — which does not involve ads — is not generated without cost-per-install ads. In other words, it’s a basic revenue stream on Facebook’s platform that it is trying to sell to advertisers. (Ads drive revenues, while other services and platforms like messaging and games drive revenues.)
“As we are focusing on the growth of mobile, we are also focused on the monetization feature,” added Sun. “We are very interested in how users think about the revenue feature.”
Mobile is a key area for FB, as more and more people access the internet from smartphones than desktops, and this is a big revenue opportunity. To date it has been very difficult for FB to turn a profit, with a net loss of $1.28 billion on revenues of $13.3 billion.
The results came with strong losses in games that were down to a $2.8 billion figure for the quarter, with a big $4.4 billion loss also in payments. Payments came in at $4.7 billion, and were up 53% to $2.1 billion to be fully covered."
"While WhatsApp has long been a much-discounted mobile service, that still isn’t enough to make it sustainable as an on-demand social network with a business model that’s simply based on the acquisition of a number of users. So, today, WhatsApp is taking another step in that direction by launching a free mobile-to-do list that can be viewed by your friends’ friends, but only a message from your phone’s contacts, regardless of whether anyone else is using the service.
The feature, the Telegram WhatsApp for iOS and Android, is basically a collect feature of the mobile messaging service. It is essentially a place where you can collect and filter the many dots that have been created by your contact. The idea is that these dots can be used later, to let people do stuff quickly, whether sharing files via Dropbox, making travel plans, or planning to leave your phone behind. (The latter is particularly helpful in this context when sharing via WhatsApp.)
The app also includes several other more useful features, like the ability to send group texts, and it will soon include the ability to use the app in ‘premium’ app environments, as well as those without an invitation, for example as a WhatsApp-managed app

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 has’t been a major factor in the direction of Microsoft’s share price at the moment – it is now trading at just under $8,000.
But Microsoft is not yet profitable.
There aren’t any operating losses, Windows 8 drives sales and so Microsoft expects some additional loss-making events later this quarter. “Surprises” like that are lumped in with the “normal” operating loss, says Microsoft’s Paul Thomas, who is working with Analysts It is too early to know what the precise impact of Windows 8 on its own financial performance.
“I think we will come back down on the higher operating loss,” he says.
He expects the company to be in the black by November.
For now, Microsoft’s operating, operating loss in its fiscal Q4 2014 was $52.4 billion, so while Q4 saw a small $3 billion operating loss in total (it was $42 billion), it was lower in proportion than its comparable year-ago quarter.
The company did not specify the reason for its loss in specific categories. “We continue to execute our strategy and plan, but in particular in the cloud and on Windows 8 we will be focused on reducing our operational expenses for 2015,” an analyst with a small sampling pointed to Windows 8 as the leading cause for its current deficit.
It has been a long, long time waiting for the Surface RT device to start selling.

The Surface RT sales were impressive at first. They were not in the category of runaway successes that other Windows RT OEMs are making with, but the Surface RT was the first Windows RT device to sell enough to justify having now more devices in the market that will not be cannibalized by the competition from Android, Windows RT and Windows 8 tablets. Microsoft’s Surface RT tablet sales were very limited at launch. They sold only as small numbers – the 8,000 Surface sales are in fact small compared to the 2,000 it sells on Amazon.
Windows RT didn’t take off on Windows 8. Surface RT, and I think that is the big takeaway in today’s earnings. The company did not break out the cost of the device but it is now a more expensive product to do business with than its original RT-based Surface RT handsets.
Today, Microsoft also had a little moment in its earnings briefing where it announced a new mobile operating system called Windows RT-Windows 8 Mobile. This, it explained, has the potential to drive Surface RT sales, so we have to wonder if Surface RT sales had a big boost in a short period of time. For Microsoft to bring the Surface RT out of retirement, it may have to spend less on that product.
Windows RT was a unique product at launch, an operating system that would have never been done in the mobile era. Windows RT allowed Microsoft to reach consumers on a range of devices — from smartphones to tablets and Macs. But in a matter of months, Redmond had to pull the Surface RT from the market, given limited choice. Windows RT had a good chance of taking off in a big way at that point or, at least on a quarter, making some headway.
The Surface RT has not yet been replaced by Windows RT. Surface RT sales are not on a par with Surface RT revenue – a quick app review from the company says that “Windows RT is not in Windows RT in the short term.” That could be the case again in December, but that doesn’t mean that it is gone and it might be difficult to see a big number of Surface RT handsets in the future.
Today, Surface RT sales accounted for only 1 percent of Surface RT revenues. Surface RT’s per-device revenue was $3 million, in fact.
In January, while Surface RT was a hot seller, its competition against Android and Apple was much stronger at the high end of the device market. In particular, Apple quickly killed off its iPad line, with its lowest price $250 model just getting phased out. However, Microsoft will continue to push Surface RT to the upper market. According to some analysts, Windows RT will eventually see its highest price point, and some Microsoft execs have even spoken about doing just that. Windows RT and Surface RT share the same market, but are not necessarily the best of brands.

"When I first tried the new iPhone 6 Plus with pre-order availability for one at Verizon Wireless, I was surprised not to see so many options available beyond the iPhone 6, and not one single top-tier camera. Even if it were a regular iPhone model, how did it get on the iPhone Radar section of the App Store.
The problem is pretty common in photography. Some people say that the iPhone is only a great camera for big shots, short videos, and low exposure shots. This can be a huge deal when you’re taking photos

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Uber’s most important task remains adding customers to its growing network of mobile apps — at least the 30,000 or so that live in Indonesia today. With iPhone-only usage growing by 40 percent annually, that would put it in a position to add millions to the 70+ million it currently has.
That’s not to say that the country has an entirely new phone-based OS (though that is definitely a theme) but it is worth noting that Facebook’s social network is one that everyone using these days. And so a lot of new money seems to be coming their way.
The news comes in early hours. We are hearing that Twitter (and WhatsApp) may be in discussions over a price-tag to announce before next week, and that a company like Facebook may be eyeing the country as a natural home base to its own mobile OS. (For others in that space: one of India’s biggest technology firms, Wipro, announced its second smartphone — a handset that runs on a minimum OS called JAV; and Facebook.)
So Indonesia could be coming closer. That is because Facebook and Twitter are working hard to grow their users there, with the launch of Facebook Messenger — the service that is a complete phone replacement — in December and an ongoing Twitter acquisition that is due to complete in 2015.
Mobile adoption is huge here in Indonesia, which is the world’s fourth most populous country with a population of more than one billion, and is already the second largest mobile market in South East Asia. Mobile usage is especially soaring. Singapore, for example, recently crossed the 100 million user mark, or three times the size of the country’s previously declared top five mobile users.
There are no mobile carriers here, though, and so while Facebook has pushed beyond its core mobile apps, its mobile presence is becoming less valuable. This is no small feat for a service where there is already plenty of ad-based revenue and it’s a market where, let’s be honest, most of those ads have been in the form of virtual goods.
While WhatsApp and SMS — the two existing major communication platforms in Indonesia that Facebook is offering as a premium download, along with free messaging — are important for social messaging growth there, it is still not nearly as easy for social media companies to get users’ attention.
“On the Facebook platform, people post more status updates and more pictures,” says Indonesia’s Matahari Mamut, who notes that while the average user has gone on to post an average of five messages every day, in Indonesia “the most important messages are the three mentioned ones (identity/friendship, job/education, and so on).”
That’s where the new service — a little under three months in the market — will come in. This is Facebook’s first move into emerging markets.
After all, while WhatsApp, in its home market, has only grown by three percentage points since the company launched in 2013, Mamut notes that Messenger has been available in the country since October. “Facebook is definitely trying to tap a growing user base in Indonesia with a premium product that they enjoy, but messaging becomes a more viable revenue for the company, as well.”
With its new service already available, Facebook will likely get a better reading of the country’s current socio-political and demographic trends by focusing on what people are saying publicly about events like presidential elections, for example.
Facebook will also be focusing on local services because “in Indonesia, most of the media coverage so far has been about Indonesians living in rural villages versus people in urban areas, and how that relates to the real state and daily life of Indonesia. The idea will be to highlight and cover both sides,” Mamut says.
Facebook, like a growing number of sites before it, is paying to monitor and identify local content, and to more effectively target ads. Mamut says that while Facebook had tried and tested some other strategic options for content, it decided that coverage was “more important just because it was more interesting.”"
"The makers of the popular social messaging app WhatsApp already figured out how to make it the go-to social network for those in emerging markets. The startup behind it, Polycom, today announced a new feature called “Stay In touch”.
The news comes as we continue to see a rapid rise in how popular it is, particularly in mature markets like the U.S. and Europe where Facebook’s main app is no longer the main one. In fact, when it comes to mobile usage, mobile usage is now the top trend in North America and Asia.

 this also shows that the company may be turning more of its attention to international markets where its products are known to be used.
“We definitely believe if someone’s asking their users to use us on a market that they care about, we’ll be part of their life cycle,” said Smith.
With a lot of these kind of partnerships, you’ve got to wonder if the next round of funding will be for more inroads and a wider kind of expansion of the operations. And, on the other side of the coin, you’ve got to wonder if any of the new $15 million is going well. Investors have said that it’s on pace to break previous record. [Update: they’ve doubled after posting their second quarter earnings report. It had set the benchmark at the end of 2011 at $8.5 million, while the second quarter had crossed the $10 million mark.]
There’s definitely no room for questions in the market and its still very young. The company was founded in 2009 and it took another 2.5 years before its first $20 million round, and so far it has raised $37 million in VC funding. So if there’s a concern or question, there’s a big need for questions to be answered and answers to be sought.
There’s a lot going on here, so, if you’re reading this post, you may need a refresher on why you’re investing in the company and what you are getting, and some of those might already be on the site.
There’s some good stuff here. If you’re new to the company, check out our previous blog post from last year. If you’re not sure what to get, here’s one that will give you an idea: I recently moved to San Francisco and have also been on an epic run here."
"A new mobile application called the Future is a book-reading experience for iOS, designed with an iPad-specific lean-back approach to reading in mind. But there is a twist in the app that should make sense more for people who grew up not knowing what to read. Instead of turning you into a potential bookworm, The Future lets you “learn to code” through an interactive storybook-like interface with accompanying puzzles and songs, which are actually stories that you could read on your phone, tablet or the iPhone.
The app, which is a digital version of the self-published book version of the future, will be available for the next two weeks. The printed book is not the real-world object of choice in today’s world of choice: mobile devices and the screen with its easy-to-play visual interface. But the novel, interactive storybook experience provides something different from a place where books and magazines are often consumed through click-ad orders.
You start off by typing a name and then, rather than having to choose your own, you pick a set of “foolhardies” like the characters, or you choose a group of “touches,” which is where the story begins. These “touches” may come from stories meant to be read by themselves, or borrowed from the creeper’s voice (e.g. “I love you” or “Oh, dearie,” which tells you “it’s written in my dad’s journal, and it comes to us through my mother.)
The book, once complete, is turned into a digital storybook with digital stories (written by Simon Ferrier, who wrote the first five volumes of his self-published book Mones & Company) that are available on the Apple App Store or Google Play. In other words, you’re reading one digital book, but as you progress through their stories, you can purchase individual chapters and add to them more details about each one.
When you’ve finished reading the story, you have a save that allows you to continue to the next chapter, section or chapter, while also allowing you to purchase individual chapters or select a specific one to follow.
The Future makes sense as a digital, book guide. The book is designed from a mobile platform, and while mobile has its advantages in terms of allowing users to access the store and read a book at the same time, the experience would also be improved if one of the main platforms to which you access the book (iPad, iPhone, Android or Android, Amazon Kindle, etc. ) was connected to the internet.
In this scenario, the Future is like a sort of Kindle for the real world, where you read the book while it downloads for you. On the internet, you might even be able to access the print book as it’s downloads.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 really they haven’t yet done a well job at pitching. Hindi really needed an injection of technology, and the fact that a lot of startups have to make a big initial investment and bring on board a big amount of talent makes for a difficult situation.
For now, Hindi has a new infusion of capital that the team isn’t ready to disclose, but adds that it has raised another $500,000 from a small group of New York-based angels.
What’s interesting are a couple of key takeaways.
One, Hindi wants to be a platform, not a service provider or market maker. Instead, it’s about aggregating curated, mobile content for a specific customer. For the most part, that means news, deals and more, but it can also include products and companies. For example, customers can build an app for the mall that is relevant to location, but they can also make more personalized recommendations such as “save for kids” and “always pay for the whole bottle.”
Another is that this particular platform has a big opportunity because Hindi has a lot of experience working in e-commerce and consumer technology. While there have been other sites out there that have also attempted to leverage the consumer data on consumers based on apps and social media posts, Hindi has the infrastructure under the hood to create experiences for mobile that are more personal (and trustworthy) than anything you’d expect from an e-commerce platform.
Hindi even recently integrated with mobile payment system iZettle. For those who still use their smartphone as their primary internet device, it seems like a good time to start to check out the mobile app.
When we spoke with Hindi co-founder and CEO Maxime Legardez after his team launched the iPad app (for Android tablets, too, the company plans to launch later this year), he emphasized the company’s technology, particularly the backend payments service.
“We have a major advantage with the iPad app, that is there’s a greater understanding that you’re not going to do this on all platforms,” he said. “We know how to connect back to the backend and execute the transactions on the backend.” It also has the benefit of offering a faster backend billing experience.
Two, mobile app consumption is increasing faster than consumer spending in general.
“As the consumerization of business slows down, IT and consumers will need to understand when a tablet user is really using the iPad to take notes, and then put them down to read about what they think,” he said."
"Google has added yet another way for developers to make money on its increasingly large and profitable Payment Card Business online retailer. The company announced this morning that it will soon allow merchants to allow businesses to pay by way of their existing credit card system or use its new “cash back” option available in beta starting today.
Currently, payment companies like PayPal and others allow merchants to pay via their existing point-of-sale system. But for some retailers, which could include smaller businesses or individuals, there is a greater demand for this additional payment component. For these merchants, the choice to accept your card payments at the point-of-sale is a technical, rather than a regulatory, act, so the prospect of getting a large enough return for its investment would drive them over to accept payments via other payment methods.
On the other hand, businesses may want to offer a more modern payment option, where customers have grown up interacting with them for decades, and where merchants know exactly who to refer them. They could easily get started with a credit card solution, then expand to a more traditional multifunctional payment system later on.
Google says it is rolling out the cash-back payments feature at selected retailers beginning today, and says it has been “testing that extensively with a wide range of businesses to identify the most compelling use cases,” but declined to provide details of the feature’s being incorporated into the wider business.
In addition to just announcing the feature, Google says it is now in discussions with large merchants “to expand this feature further,” although it doesn’t get into further details."
"Hootsuite, a social media monitoring platform from social analytics company Social.com and marketing analytics company Insights360 (formerly known as Jawed Karim), is opening the doors to a partnership with brands that use its analytics in conjunction with its CRM software.
The deal is a big one for both companies — Hootsuite will now become a marketing analytics partner along with Insights360. And part of this will be to help Social.com analyze more data about online communications, including things like website traffic and analytics.
The partnership with Social.com is a significant one

 per the time on their phone, while the most recent push-to-refresh of Facebook’s mobile platform is underway, and Twitter’s push may be seen as a response too.
This isn’t the first Facebook-to-Twitter push notification we’ve seen. Twitter last week boosted its push notification volume to seven times its previous volume of push messages.
Twitter last spring started its push notifications into a frenzy of pre-sets of push notifications, which could include an alert to your friends about a new tweet. Facebook also previously announced users can expect push notifications in about three more months. While push messaging has become a familiar way to communicate on mobile, you could see the power of a push notification system like this (as well as the potential ad opportunities it could encourage) in other services as well.
Facebook’s recent foray into its Instant Articles program and new push notification feature should help bring the push-delivered version of its news feed and homepage more users. Still, the company needs to do more to make push seem less unbundling of personal data and content. Otherwise, users might start to see Facebook’s push-based push instead of their friends’ and social networks’ push as a way to make their feeds more interesting instead of something to advertise.

"I don’t quite need to keep abreast of the latest iPhone app updates, but there’s no shortage of Android apps that come out with major updates in exchange for free upgrades. There are plenty of updates to Gmail and FaceTime in the current release series, with every one of them keeping its existing premium feature set intact. A new app called “Pulse” is just the latest to add new premium tools for creating rich media tweets (alongside making those tweets more personal).
I first caught wind of Pulse when a friend of mine was intrigued by the new featured tweet author interface that the company had opened up, designed not only to let you customize what kinds of tweets you see, but to actually select what type of content you want to see in a tweet – a “photo”, “video”, “graphic”, “music” or even whatever’s that your friends recommend. Pulse makes it super easy for you to select the content you want to see first, and then customize your tweet accordingly.
In addition to a new star-based writer input interface, friends can now add text by dragging their finger, and it has been greatly improved with regards to letting you drag a predefined range of your fingers from the edge of the screen to the middle of the screen to any part of the screen – the feature only works on mobile.  
In addition, Pulse adds much-needed support for rich media editing, and makes it easier to preview media on the fly. 
In addition, the new mobile apps are a great way to check if you like what I’m doing. A lot of people have commented on the lack of support for more advanced social media publishing, and I’m sure plenty of third-party developers would love to help out.
What’s nice is that these apps have already been out for a couple of months, and the first update for the series is a free upgrade to continue building out the company. There are no technical integrations to be found here, though.
What’s nice is to see the company continue to iterate quickly about these things. I can’t think any of the above apps will stick around for more than a couple of updates, if only because they’re pretty experimental in nature and don’t feel forever dated. 
I personally liked one of these more than the one before – the first one is a great way to start with a fresh look for Facebook on Android, and while I get great mobile usage, I’ll still want to check back in a year when I’m not using every Android phone."
"It’s been a year of a long journey for this Russian startup, Prezi. Founded by Rurik Mistry, the company is an innovative voice-to-text dictation software company that wants to bring natural language processing to all sorts of devices and smart phones. And that’s not the only thing that the company has in place. It also offers its software as an SDK outside of Russia and, on the surface, the startup is coming out of stealth mode with a new version to the market. It’s going to start with mobile phones, laptops and desktops in the coming months and comes with 17 new features — nine of them are new.
Prezi is a natural language technology company after all. Mistry first became interested in this area when his 14-year-old niece was born. “The world is different when it comes to talking with kids. The biggest

 agencies.
It also says that the two-person team operates with a lot of people that are no longer working.
The company was founded in 2012, and until recently had been based out of some offices in New York. It raised a Series A from a private equity group from some of the people that had worked at Yelp and the company, after co-creating a Yelp blog.
This is something that the two founders have both said they would tackle with their own business, but in the end this is an interesting route for the company to take to scale — it comes as a counterbalance to the fact that much of the work that the company has done has been focused on maintaining the existing Yelp experience."
"While Android has shown sharp growth among the global PC market, the performance of the platform overall has yet to make its mark in the same way as Apple/iOS. Today, Gartner has published its latest state-by-universe report about global PC sales, and the fact that Windows is still the most popular OS choice.
“Tablet usage and smartphone usage grew strongly in Q4,” says Caroline Saffe in a statement. “While Windows Phone remained at the low end of the market for a period, tablet usage and smartphone usage grew considerably, both of which drove faster sales than Android was growing.”
In the first quarter of this year, the number of tablet sales to active users was 12 percent year-plus. By Q2 last year, a quarter more tablet sales than last quarter. While tablet growth is still early, if the trend continues, it could lead to an even higher proportion of active users now being able to hold a tablet.

Tablet usage grew sharply in Q5, growing from 13 percent last quarter to 21 percent this year. Again, for Q4 2012, Gartner cites “experience-driven factors” as the main reason for the jump (albeit other factors include general consumer dissatisfaction with larger screen smartphones and some other head-related changes to OS avatars and icons, and also as people in emerging markets adopt smartphones faster.
As we move toward smartphones, it’s also still early days for the PC situation. Gartner expects worldwide PC shipments to reach 8.9 million units in Q1 2013, a rise of a modest -0.5 percent from the 6.3 million units last quarter. The desktop market, meanwhile, will continue to decline — even if Gartner expects growth to slow down to some level as emerging markets transition from desktop to smartphone.
Growth in PC sales will continue to slow as more people buy mobile phones and tablets, particularly in Q2. And that may actually see sales of PC’s relative performance begin to plateau even faster. “We expect that the performance of current PC PCs will continue to fall in 2012,” writes Saffe.

Of course, this won’t have an impact on how iPad sales are performing — Gartner expects iPads to sell “well in excess of 50 million units in Q2 2013, compared to 60 million units for 2012,” owing to their continued sale on sale in emerging markets.
In other words, while the two platform categories appear to still have significant growth potential, the bigger growth opportunity is in the shrinking mobile segment. It’s still growing, despite all the talk of tablets that, by 2011, had shrunk in the market by over a fifth. And while the market for tablet growth appears to still have plateaued, its performance has declined, and there are still strong expectations that it will hit a plateau in Q2 2013 as its price of PC’s continues to be squeezed lower.
As you can see in Gartner’s full chart, the tablet market actually continues to grow at the same rate as it has for past years. But its decline in Q2 likely has an indirect impact on the iPad’s overall performance. Part of the reason for the bump in growth for Apple compared with the iPad is that we remember the Surface Pro with its large screen, and we expect that trend to continue into Q1 2013."
"The number, which we previously covered, shows that Salesforce is doubling down on its mobile strategy as part of an ongoing effort to expand the company from the consumer web to the enterprise.
This latest report covers the period ending November 30. At the end of December, the company revealed that it now has 12 of the top 20 enterprise sites on their iOS and Android apps. It isn’t clear where that data is sourced from, except that it’s taken from a “wide range of sites across a spectrum” that includes “blogs, RSS feeds, and enterprise applications.” (It’s using enterprise apps and mobile apps to

 much, as well.
It will be interesting to see how much traction the app picks up to be downloaded now, if anyone really cares, or in the end whether it stays a pleasant experience or not.
For now, it will remain available for both iOS, as well as Android, if you’d rather not give up a whole new app experience.
The app is an interesting take on the idea of a personal assistant, taking some cues from Google Now, the mobile assistant that is supposed to learn your preferences and contextual information about you and, in turn, serve up tailored, timely information about your life and interests.
The “personal assistant” concept might give you the sense that a “personal assistant” could have knowledge of your preferences and interests, or it could have the sense that a Google Now-style product is starting to know your preferences, or use the power of a full-sized personal assistant to keep you up-to-date across the various apps you use.

As you know, the technology is being used in the personal fitness tracking space, for example, and in the smart home. But it’s hard to say that of the different personal fitness apps in the market. Perhaps some will get you out the door, and some won’t…
Maybe, depending on the app and the success, users will either love the app or won’t. Either way, there’s something interesting here in the smart-home space, and that’s probably what we’ll look at next."
"Mobile analytics provider Sensor Tower just scored a new patent for the term “iBeacon.” This is supposed to apply to things like the iPhone’s camera roll, or the ones from existing Bluetooth beacon devices, such as Apple’s HomeKit.
“The iBeacon standard focuses on ultra-low-power, iBeacons configured to behave like Wi-Fi enabled physical devices,” explains The Wall Street Journal. (Apple has been getting into this area with the “HomeKit” software, but it’s not clear if this is the same thing as a full “HomeKit” functionality as in previous versions.)
“The technology is still a relatively immature standard at the moment; I think it’s a combination of technologies with different costs and performance characteristics,” the article’s author wrote.
In addition to the patent, Apple has announced the third commercial implementation of the Beacon tech, a partnership with tech makers LIFX and Sift Technologies. The Apple TV is the key feature here, but since the hardware makers have historically been slow to integrate their technologies, it remains to be seen how much traction that will lead to on the consumer side.
The patent for “iBeacon” is worth a little over $10 million, and includes some detail on how to patent on the tech. Apple has the ability to track the effectiveness of beacons more easily than any wireless technology currently on the market.
In a statement, a LIFX spokesperson said:
The iPhone camera roll contains photos and videos recorded by users for a small percentage of users from around the world but never seen by anyone, nor is the ability to delete the photos.
Apple’s patent might be very, very useful in terms of tracking things like lighting conditions or temperature, but it could be used to do things like track down a person in the house if they suddenly die in a room or when they turn their lights off."
"You may not be familiar with Periscope, the video app that’s been down for around 16 hours and is currently being restored, but it’s been doing a lot of things right since the app crashed back on May 18. Periscope has added more features to help distinguish it in its crowded community by making it easier to search for where you are and then to broadcast.
Today, Periscope added a number of things to improve the experience, including a better way to find where you are and to ask for help. The company says on Hacker News that “you can now find who is online and instantly tell them to go save and upload a video”.
The ability to broadcast has been a big focal point for Periscope in the past few days. A report from TechCrunch on Saturday said that Periscopers had been using the app to broadcast to the New York City Police Department’s Twitter account when a friend posted an image of them using the Periscope app. Some users quickly reported seeing a screen with the “New Screens” label, and while a Twitter engineer contacted us about what happened, it’s more than just a bug. It’s also a way to help users cut down on all of the spamming that can happen on social media, and a big improvement for the community.

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
&R, the startup is making a big push for the U.K. market — with its full-fat marketing offering starting as a free trial before letting in-app usage start (unlimited on Android, iOS, and the web). The latter will come with a pricing bundle that begins at £499.99 per seat, and which also offers a full “pro” package that extends this to £599.99/seat. That covers everything in the U.K. — mobile, landline and online advertising, with the latter including integrated mobile and website optimization, free technical support in the U.K., and 24/7 customer service during sales.
This is one of the highest priced in-market packages for a marketing campaign in the U.K. — and it’s the only service that works well enough in this part of the U.K., says Mounib. “We also offer another feature that is quite unique for UK marketing: live broadcast integration with 2,000 of the top UK social media sites (here’s the list, I’m told, with live links/calls and texts to YouTube and Vodafone).”
To tackle the other big challenge of online advertising — getting people using it in the first place — Mounib says the startup is developing a series of technology to get a head start on getting advertisers and marketers to adopt its technology. It will be using the new injection of cash to fund its growth with further R&D, focusing on more than social media monitoring.
“There is of course no shortage of brands and social media sites available to target people, and many of those sites are finding no suitable and/or are very outdated/unresponsive,” Mounib explains. “This means that to fill this gap we are working on technology to solve this issue. With our technology and engagement platform we’re building a solution that will not only help to identify these issues early stage in a more creative and engaging way, but will also help identify the issues that need to be fixed (and I hope will be fixed by Christmas).”
The solution? It’s “live” monitoring, leveraging the live activity from any website or app to create detailed information about the activities that are relevant to the brand,” he adds. Mounib said the company has built its own algorithm that takes in information from the site and displays information in a graphical interface so that it can be “aggressively” pushed to the platform, “in real time”.
“If a user is logged in, they will see information that is unique to the website, unique to the device. We also have strong data on user behaviour and this is a very powerful technology for targeting audience during live events,” he says.
The potential for this is huge. Social media marketing — where companies have to monitor what is happening across different networks based on “unlimited data sets” — is becoming increasingly commoditized. “If brands require real time tracking with regard to their Facebook fans and Twitter followers they will find it hard to do because many brands don’t want to invest resources in infrastructure and a dedicated platform to actually monitor those networks,” says Mounib.
It’s therefore developed an “antenna,” the platform that Mounib refers to as “a super sophisticated product” that combines “inspiration and analytics” using “an array of techniques that are constantly being developed by our team and others”. This includes:
“live data, in an aggregate and aggregated way”;
relying on “hundreds of sources”;
“unlimited datasets and a real time view”;
and taking a “data approach”. That’s a pretty ambitious pitch, but a lot to execute."
"Trying new APIs and building apps that integrate with them is one of the hardest parts of app development. That’s why CodeNow.com has developed an automated content network that will guide users through the code hell and provide an internal tool that the developer is using to either build or recommend the right way to apply code to the product.
CodeNow.com is the newest project from the CodeNow.com co-founders Adam Mones, Garrett Johnson and Bill Liao. Each of Mones’ venture capital companies focuses on a specific type of problem, and he or she will guide you through solving it, and in the case of CodeNow.com, will provide some sample code for a company that you might be interested in. The startup has raised $1.8 million to date from investors like Insight Venture Partners, LAUNCH Capital, SoftTech VC, Foundry Group, Voyager Capital and Y Combinator.

 many who make similar gestures to quickly move through apps.
But while these gestures are helpful for moving between apps, they can also be annoying for telcoms and data companies whose services depend on voice and text for revenues. That’s because they distract the phones from a caller who’s being treated to a lot of data — not to mention the call is often the largest in the call, and often a more important one.

So in a new app called Swytch — which is basically a voice and text app that lets users tap phones together to connect them with people — you’ll be able to tap phones together in this way to call people together and then have one person talk to you from a phone, too.

 
It’s not quite as novel as those voice commands you could find on iOS, or Android, but it is more common. For instance, if you send someone a YouTube video they may not want to watch, but they should still be able to tap you on a phone to connect.
There’s actually an option to use multiple phones — with four different phones available if you’d like. But there’s not much practical in the app right now.
Swytch actually came out of an app incubator in Norway last year,  working for a startup called Nudie. I was one of the founding team. And this is a product from that program.
The app is completely free, and it doesn’t offer in-app advertising. The company is focusing on its core usage as that.
I, for one, am definitely going to try this. I have a number of cameras. I actually live in a major international city already, also in the Arctic Circle, and I’m hoping to connect people in an app, especially if I find that they’re actually in the same market as me. I’ll be testing it out tonight in San Francisco."
"Munches are fun, but if you don’t enjoy them, nothing gets done. That’s why apps that let you create, send, and receive them will become anonymously valuable. That’s because while the app store, download apps, download apps, and share them have been a part of the mobile experience for years, they still suffer from the problem of being associated with a single single feature. So today, developer Fadeproduct, which describes itself as a “new generation media company,” is joining forces with the Launch.us accelerator program to bring its creations to the market.
The accelerator, whose first class of 10 startups will select several dozen startups to debut in September, will offer support for pre-orders and demo-days.
Fadeproduct is the brainchild of two software developers whose backgrounds include time spent at large, profitable companies like Facebook and Salesforce, as well as time spent working on the projects at smaller companies that weren’t profitable and that “were too focused on having as little public disclosure,” says its founding group’s advice.
That last group, it turns out, is the venture arm of incubator 500 Startups, which today counts Twitter among its entrepreneurs. Founded in 2012, Fadeproduct’s founding team began working on apps about four years ago, and those ideas later formed the basis for the products of launch.
Unlike many other startup incubators, Accelerator’s 10 companies have each received $100,000 in funding, but in order for the program to be accepted, all ten apps have to be on at least two different stages in their development. In other words, one startup can still start working on an app that the incubator has already accepted, one at a time. Fadeproduct CEO John Nolt agrees that while the startups are technically still a few stages and may not be fully launched, the founders are still eager to use the services they’re already developed.
It sounds like the idea is for the startups to have a long, drawn-out exploration of their apps, but it’s also hard to do that while keeping a low profile. In many ways, that’s the right way of doing it. The startups are selected by the startup team after having completed an intense work-flow stage, and the incubator staff is also not mandated to follow-up when each team finishes up its work. (Because, well, time is short.)
Nolt also argues that the program has a “technology-only” focus, which means that the team is already “rewarded” for its work. (A number of the companies that have received help from Accelerator include several of the above groups.)
“At the end up, we’ve probably come away with some pretty

 creatively to me but I find them a step above others I’ve used in the past (though not the most user-friendly designs for things like photos, for example).
“I try to get to design something that I know, and I think it works, and hopefully our customers can be big winners,” says Eve-Labs, who adds that the app is, at launch, primarily aimed at designers who are looking to use it to scale up their websites and other properties. “We want people who use it just to know that we’re here, and we have new services of our own which we’re going to make available in the future.”"
"It’s no wonder Facebook is here right now. The company is reportedly working on the first-ever video chat app for mobile, with a follow-up question about what will be featured. The tech giant is now also expanding its WhatsApp Messenger service, with the aim of building a social layer that will become the ‘new standard’ for the messaging experience.
This will include the ability for users to pay and get stuff relevant to each chat thread — so messaging the person who just added your contact and pay-walled address, for instance — and the ability from the chat group, to send pictures and video (using a new in-app camera), which is being described as an interactive video message.
The new features appear to be live now on WhatsApp’s servers on a user’s web browser but have been rolling out earlier this month in the U.S. and India.
The rollout will be in beta during the next two months, with a view to ramping up an iOS and Android version when the new versions hit.
Here are the latest steps Facebook is taking to build out the user-friendly chat experience for mobile chat clients, noting that there are no other platforms as part of the launch, as a version of the app is currently only available to UK WhatsApp users, with European and Asian countries slated later:
This mobile app is not the first time Facebook has appeared to be wanting to play with messaging on mobile. In October, Facebook ran a test with Facebook Lite (which appears to have been not dropped by the maker) where users on Android could chat with friends in Messenger, or use Messenger to message with people, rather than having to leave Facebook messages. This was also a trial to help the social network get users more comfortable using its messaging service.
The latest features on the list is the ability for users to make voice calls using a call button on the web, but it’s possible the feature will also be coming soon. Calls are then routed to the recipient’s phone, rather than calling them in Messenger — which will presumably be helpful in areas where there’s little data connectivity, or simply because it’s less taxing on a mobile phone’s battery.
Facebook is continuing to test how messaging feels on mobile, with one feature that will be available later today: photo uploads. This was first flagged to TechCrunch by Facebook’s Josh Constine, who said: “It seems like a fun idea just to note to people.”
Another feature on the road map is the option for users to “teach” users — which would mean they could be given access to additional features that they have to pay for (such as extra stickers or ‘lots’). Or that they might get prompted to take a new set of messages, which may eventually be a feature that Facebook will also turn into its own messaging product.
There’s also no mention of third-party apps or apps, though as we’ve noted before, Facebook has in the past made an announcement or two about how Messenger would become an app independent of its core app: iMessage and WhatsApp. We’ve been covering the latter at this point since it launched its web app with a number of Facebook-exclusive features, back in April.
This latest move fits the messaging piece in with a blog post earlier this month, in which Facebook also talked up the new WhatsApp for business communications feature. It describes this as a separate app from the main Facebook app but also a Facebook-owned app, designed “to make it easier to reach your company’s global audience through messaging, photos and videos”. So it’s building out the mobile messaging content platform, just as it has the larger Facebook app, also designed to have a mobile social touch-paper feel

When Facebook acquired WhatsApp last year, and replaced its then-CEO and co-founder at the same time, it did so to upgrade its mobile business and communications software suite.
Since launching messaging in 2007, Facebook has made moves to convert the consumer service into a mobile

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
In The Loop’s trial of a new version of the service, the startup has managed to build its original site running on an iPad app, thanks to a distribution partnership with Flipboard. But this beta period of operations is just an experiment, the company says, and as it sees what’s happening inside the service, it may roll out features and functionality to meet the needs of its growing user base.
“It’s just meant to be a little experiment,” the startup’s co-founder and CEO Adam Somlai-Perez told me at this morning’s TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2013 conference. “We wanted this to be a little rough around the edges, so we rolled it back.” It’s been two months since The Loop released the first version of its service, and Somlai-Perez says they’ve received lots of feedback from users in regards to the original version, and more changes are in the works to make it easier for the company to manage all the different pieces of content.


The initial focus for The Loop was more on a discovery component, allowing users to see what other people are discussing on a given thread. But with the new version, the site now can present you with a page of top quotes (the company keeps an eye on what users are sharing, to keep track of what people are saying and who), trending topics, top comments, and more. So in addition to more contextual, reader-friendly browsing, The Loop also allows users to ask each other questions and provide notes along the way.
The first impression that Somlai-Perez made when looking at the changes with his brother was that The Loop is more social than Pandora. That’s true of many other conversational apps, like WhatsApp and most recently Skype (which, like The Loop, also features a discovery feature, but is more focused on what you’re listening to and what you’re sharing than on what you’re sharing), but even so, when you consider how social the experience can be, Somlai-Perez says The Loop has “really come to feel like a real experience” with the addition of context and location.
Users are now contributing to the platform’s database of notes, which can be found under the new name “Trackele” and displayed on both the web and mobile, and will be used to facilitate discussions around particular points of discussion. The first step, says Somlai-Perez, will be “discovery outreach,” where the Loop will be creating a feature dedicated to helping users discover which of their peers are friends, and which of their friends are following the shared “popular” content (i.e. trending items). From there, the goal is to build a “networks” around topics, which Somlai-Perez says is where The Loop wants to take a little personalization.
“How can you trust each individual…that’s the hard part,” he adds, talking about The Loop’s privacy policies. “How do I rely on you?”
The Loop may still be able to tap into the social and mobile trends for good – just think about what YouTube and more recently Facebook allow for, notes Somlai-Perez – but as Somluckou points out, it’s also building a service out to help people connect with one another. “It has a ton of competition in it,” he says, but that’s also why it’s trying to build things itself.
“We’ve been on the internet for years, and we’re frustrated by how it’s been commoditized…we’re a true platform play,” he says. “Now we’re trying to make a social engine that can play on all the devices.”
The accelerator and investor interest are not a surprise – as Somluckou explains, TheLoop has “always been very open” when it comes to embracing new ideas, like the way people communicate with one another today. And that’s also why The Loop is doing $50K in seed funding (a combination of both debt and equity), with a $100K commitment from The Loop’s founding team.
The Loop, Somluckou says, is also open to working with a new team led by Jason Seats, a product designer at Nest. The team has also hired John O’Farrell, who previously worked at Tumblr and is also a former employee at Crashlytics, and Dave O’Brien, who’s also currently the design leader at Twitter. As others in The Loop’s family say they’re “fed up with [

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 memes, a lot of the rest is content. You can comment, like, follow and favorite items but you can’t post a photo or message.
The app lets you search for a particular category and then find and follow the right people. This way, you feel like you’re a part of something important.
With a small team, Periscope already released Instagram video and Instagram audio. Now it’s time to take Facebook’s social network with you.
With Periscope, you can only take a look at one picture at a time, and even though you share on Twitter and Facebook, you can forget about it afterwards. But only share the perfect pic. While Instagram lets you take pictures at your exact exact exact same moment, you often have to choose between going to the Camera app or your iOS Camera Roll. In Periscope, the same idea holds true.
But it’s a mixed experience as Periscope wants you to be able to share as many photos as possible. For example, if there is no chance of seeing that the sunset is red, a lot of users choose not to post an image. With Periscope, the app is all about the photo as soon as it’s posted.
When users go to take a picture in Periscope, they discover a category, like sports, Nature or art. From there, a button for choosing this particular photo will pop up to choose a photo format. The rest of the photo will be automatically uploaded to Facebook.
A big button at the bottom allows you to send to friends in Periscope. This option will be in Periscope’s “Subscribe” section. It will not allow uploading your photos to Facebook, though. These guys are going after the whole community, so this button will probably not get many users.
But still, these photo viewers will want access to their photo stream. For example, on Periscope. You can either share a photo and watch passively or shoot something to share and watch from Periscope. You are then prompted to upload.
Finally, the most important element of Periscoping is its pause button, which lets you go after photos as fast as you decide to pause. You can quickly switch this feature on or off by swiping your finger or thumb. This pause button is a bit harder to hide when I compared it to Periscope’s button.
I feel like Periscope is going to be a free app with more interesting features that don’t make more sense in a video app, like Periscope and perhaps Instagram. But Periscope’s potential lies in the more polished experience as opposed to Periscope.
I’ve been playing around with Periscope for a few days now. The experience feels fresh, the UI is perfect for the moment. It’s like Snapchat meets Vine.
With the new app, Periscope is much more of a social experience than a game or Instagram. It’s like a photo with very simple mechanics — and yet it feels alive and energetic. You can take a photo, pause and then replay it, just like in real-time. The best part is that when you receive a push notification on your phone, it feels like receiving a push notification in the background.
But there is one flaw with Periscope. It doesn’t work on mobile. It just works on the web, desktop and Mac client. I’m not sure why Periscope is focusing on desktop right now. It’s just a very focused lens, and it’s the most beautiful lens on a smartphone.
With Snapchat, there is Instagram, Vine, a good video chat app and many, many others. Now, I’m going to be using Periscope myself. I hope Periscope has an amazing and unique feature that won’t get lost with Snapchat.
And finally, the Android app is great once again. I don’t think it has reached the tipping point yet, but it is still a very compelling experience to play with. I’m not sure if Periscope will be in the same space as Kik, WhatsApp, Line, WhatsApp or other new apps, but it is already taking away a few percent of the photos crowd.
Periscope is a free app with a small budget. You can download it here in iTunes."
"A little over a year ago, I wrote about two guys visiting India with two guns blazing. It’s not as fun as, say, this picture of the solar-powered Aquila drone being tested by Twitter employees.
Since then, I have read a bunch of articles about robotics and the Indian engineering industry. Now I was inspired to go there with some money.
I’ve learned there are a lot of interesting companies operating in India. There’s a lot of talent

 letter at a time, or they can send you a gift card that you can redeem at Project Araif from the company’s website. A small fee will also get you an Amazon.com gift card. And finally, Amazon will send you a Kindle free of charge.
This all sounds like it should be pretty intuitive, it’s like using an Amazon Prime account, or it would be the same as sending a PayPal gift. On that front, it just feels like Amazon’s mobile gift platform, and the project starts today as part of a pilot program for Amazon Canada/Australia.
This isn’t Amazon’s first gesture that we’ve seen towards the world of connected devices. Amazon itself is working hard with the FCC to approve more kinds of device access."
"Evernote is announcing today “Evernote Business Edition”, a free, premium version of its popular personal information and productivity app that’ll be available to Evernote users on both iOS and Android devices. Evernote claims this is the first premium app available outside the U.S. and will arrive worldwide in the next four weeks. The Evernote Enterprise Edition puts enterprise-friendly features — like syncing, sharing and search to the cloud — in parity with Evernote’s consumer offering, which is why it’s hard not to see why some users might resist the switch to enterprise-friendly features.
As for security and stability, co-founder Phil Libin told me in a phone interview that he believes Evernote has a hard enough name to maintain without confusing people with the Evernote consumer app: security is what makes it stand out in today’s market (and even the enterprise market, which is still in the planning, thanks to partnerships with IBM and others), and it’s what Evernote is using to differentiate itself as a business tool in a market dominated by others including Google Drive, SAP, Salesforce and more.
Evernote Business Edition also comes with an additional perk compared to the consumer product, which might particularly appeal to enterprise users: the Premium add-on, which lets users sign up for Evernote Business Edition and use the free app, premium features and features, is available as a free upgrade to the consumer and is available on both mobile and desktop versions.
Evernote Business Edition is available as a free update to Evernote Premium users."
"As more reports of ARM-based Windows and Mac servers continue to fill the airwaves — the latest new report comes on an ongoing problem for Microsoft’s hardware business — the company’s corporate vice president for internet and server solutions Andy Glaudy took the stage at the Bloomberg Technology conference in San Francisco today to discuss the company’s long-term ambitions.
He focused primarily on Microsoft’s mobile business, and how the company will continue to push into that area going forward. “We’ve got to make things much more mobile,” he said. And that’s something that we are seeing now, with the ARM-based chipsets that the company has been touting for a while now.
Glaudy also touched on other challenges Microsoft could be having alongside that. “The PC war is a zero sum game,” he noted. “You can’t have PCs on ARM.” Windows RT is not an alternative, despite the company’s efforts to push into that category. He pointed out this could very well be another area for Microsoft and Windows to try to attack.
The Surface Book “is coming early next year,” he said (again, with no direct reference to the Surface Book in Windows RT), so Microsoft isn’t looking to compete on that front at the moment. “We will have it there in 2013. In 2014 is going to be some point, and we will also have a range of other products,” he added. In other words, the Surface Book is likely to get pushed down in 2015.
He also touched on the future of wearables, and how Microsoft sees its services evolving. “We have a suite of services in the space,” he said, but with “so many pieces” it’s a “challenging” thing for Microsoft to get it right.
When we asked him what his impressions were of Windows 8, and specifically the Windows Phone, Glaudy said Microsoft sees “significant opportunities in the right context for us” with the Windows 10 version out now. “I can’t comment on future hardware,” he said.
Glocalized, Microsoft has been making the new ARM processor chips for its Windows 8 devices for almost two years already. “So far we’ve had some good feedback; there’s a small subset of people that has asked for this,” he

 in an effort to help its users find new games to download. But unlike similar startups, which have targeted games, the company is trying to help developers promote the games to their fan bases.
With this new version out today, fans will be able to watch and be notified when the developers launch their latest titles, and also access their entire catalog of content for free, says Beam Inc.
Beam, along with its parent company Matterhorn, had previously raised $1.2 million in funding last fall, according to CrunchBase.
This new version of Beam will allow users to stream live, curated games and apps straight from their smartphones, as well as browse available titles, notes Beam Inc.
The company is also announcing that it will open an online gaming platform that it calls Live Stream.
According to a blog post, the team hopes that this will allow them to not only increase its offerings for fans, but also help increase the monetization of its properties, with the potential to generate additional income.
However, Beam says that until now, its “push to empower mobile developers and gamers to enjoy and share their rich content” hasn’t really been able to make this transition because of an inability to share and monetize that content.
In other words, the company has been mostly focused on making the biggest revenue from users’ subscriptions and the games themselves – it was this model that it initially pursued, but it has since fallen on hard times. However, the company is now trying to find ways to continue growing its subscriptions while allocating more resources to the games themselves, including the release of Live Stream.
Live Stream will be live for users to watch, comment and share.
The company says that it has been successful in attracting investors and has been profitable since it was founded in 2007, and it now has a roster of well over 500 titles to distribute through Beam’s services. In addition to its content library, it also has ongoing content related to streamers for video, like the latest Call of Duty episode, as well as a number of new games from developer studios that include Boom Studios, Inc., id Software and 2go. Beam will help the developers monetize their offerings via streaming.
“Our strategy is to give fans as much choice as possible when it comes to their entertainment,” Beam says."
"Yahoo today is announcing a new cross-platform video streaming initiative that will allow users living in Europe, Australia, Asia and Israel to watch video streaming from these sites on their smartphones, tablets or PCs. The new initiative, called PlayQ, is aimed at enabling sites to provide mobile video streaming video streaming to users without requiring them to install a third-party browser extension. The company claims that PlayQ’s content can be 30 percent more expensive than its YouTube competitors.
YouTube’s recent moves into Europe and Asia, which it says the company made clear earlier this year, are about expanding access to its video platform in a bid to make more money from users, which it needs to meet its IPO schedule next year.
The PlayQ efforts to make PlayQ, a content platform that lets partners syndicate their videos to Yahoo’s site or service, available for the first time to a much wider demographic of potential users by offering them a wider array of video sites to view them for.
The news of today’s announcement, PlayQ CEO and Content Group Ken Goldman told TechCrunch is an effort to “increase user engagement and participation by streamers who are more monetizable and less reliant on YouTube”. Yahoo says the YouTube site is now available for 30 minutes of viewing every hour, so its service already works to help users find videos, make their own clips and view ones on the fly.
Goldman said that PlayQ will be available for play on mobile devices as well as desktop computers. The company’s first partner is BBC Worldwide for two hours of its livestreaming. The first episode will launch in 30 countries and the company says the beta program will expand to Europe, and others in 2014.

Yahoo is playing to its strengths as a content platform in this case, in that it claims that PlayQ’s audience numbers will reach 60 million online users across 160 countries. It said that PlayQ is not providing a number at this point, but that it has been growing at 300 percent to 40 million monthly global monthly active users per month, up from around 30 million in early 2014 when it last announced the news of this effort.
The plan for PlayQ is to eventually expand it to more sites. As of May 30, YouTube PlayQ will be available at 30,000 videos and sites in over 160 countries, up from just 5 million videos that it has on that site. (The company’s previous moves into mobile and other places to promote its

, can work like an emulation of a human brain.
While that ability may seem like a minor thing, this is actually something that Facebook has been actively working on since it launched social graph data last December.
In fact, it’s a lot of what Facebook has been developing, and in the future it will be possible to see this as a layer over the other layers that companies don’t have access to. Facebook also recently revealed that it has been investing in a new type of AI-based neural network that can learn from a single user during his or her sessions on Facebook, and help it develop a more comprehensive understanding of how people use social media.

In fact, this may be the first time that this kind of technology has been available for a consumer-level service. As it’s now developed by Facebook, the technology will be “fed back” to advertisers who want to use it more directly to target specific users.
There is a chance that if this technology is developed, it could be applied to calls, and could replace the aging capabilities that carriers are now using to call for the Internet, and it could also work for video. For instance, advertisers on Facebook could tell a call center to ring you when someone calls, and that’s when Facebook would be able to recognize that the call had been made.

Of course, a consumer-facing social service also makes sense for those who work all the time, from accounting down to research on new ideas and technology. While this will likely be the first use cases, Facebook’s work on neural networks will also also allow it to be used in other areas. So in other areas that have a significant history of communication, we could imagine this also becoming a way for people to take a pause from the big screen to chat with representatives of people in the world.
One thing that has made Facebook more useful is that we can now take a picture frame around each other’s picture which is able to serve as a visual representation of our communication in real time, without being there to get blurry pictures. The algorithms that would understand this context will be capable of recognizing the individual in real-time and recognizing their facial expressions."
"“What’s the quickest way to save a life?” That’s the simple response it’s been trying to give to its millions of users.
Until now. And that’s all it was.
When we first announced the death of Pokemon Go last year, we were trying to convince people it was going to kill their apps. The idea was that they needed to be able to search for Poke balls to start leveling up. And so we were.
That ended up being an entirely unnecessary loss for the loyal users.
The death of Pokemon Go has also resulted in one of the most amazing and terrifying moments in our lives. It became one of the most successful “Internet Works Of The Year,” a designation given to the programs put in place as the work of the people who helped build the technology and infrastructure that facilitated its creation: Facebook, Amazon, Uber, Lyft, Twitter, WhatsApp, Pinterest, Airbnb, etc.
Of course, as each new application of Pokemon Go’s technology is introduced into the market it has a new set of potential to further grow.

In this case, we’re talking about the “n-th-a-life.”
The “n-th-a-lifer” in Pokémon GO is literally the next generation of our technology. It is a new interface that is not only empowering, it represents the future.
The challenge that we had to address with Pokémon Go was that the mechanic of finding Poke balls in new surroundings was suboptimal.
But the experience of simply stepping inside a Pokémanu where you find one of those aforementioned Pokéballs is suboptimal.
And so, Pokémon GO was born. And so, the “th-a-life” is born.

It’s not uncommon for tech companies to try to address problems. Of course, they’re often right — the tech world as we know it today is a technological wasteland. And people were initially skeptical of the whole process.
What caught the eye of millions was the opportunity to build a social app that was accessible to everyone with an Internet connection. And that’s the ultimate goal for “Pokémon GO” — if you want to find a Pokéball fast enough to make it across the whole United States.
What’s really encouraging, as the startup’s CEO John Hanke told me last week, is that the “n-th-a-lif

%) — meaning the value of each dollar is just $1.00 USD — which is the same cost as buying a video game. Because of tax, Facebook will charge $1.00 a month for each video game that’s paid by itself.
For more information on its plans to charge the equivalent of a few thousand dollars a month, Facebook has asked all those interested in the experiment to visit this page and wait for it to load.
The goal is that you’ll find Facebook’s video sharing feature to be really easy to navigate. When you click the “Share Video” button on a Facebook Page, you’ll be directed a little to Facebook’s video site. But you also get a pop-up window showing other sites like YouTube, Vimeo, Vine, Instagram, YouTube and more. Click a thumbnail and you’ll get the same video feed.
In other words, it takes a lot less typing, and Facebook will be trying to convince non Facebook-using people to adopt it by making YouTube into something more of a social network. In fact, it may have been too simple to the right. A YouTube video is so basic and devoid of content that the company may have made it so easy to slip it in, but it turns out that people have liked YouTube enough, and you should be able to switch around video with no need for switching apps.
For that reason, people take advantage of Facebook Pages at first, and Facebook won’t stop there. Eventually, Facebook will build out every other piece of content in the service and make it easy to move between them, like when you post.
Here’s how this works:
If it seems confusing, it is. We’re all familiar with Facebook’s navigation in our Facebook apps. Instead of digging down into someone else’s app to figure out their Facebook friends and interests, Facebook has to teach us.
Let’s call this “The Unifying Ring”:

You click on a link in a Facebook notification that mentions The Unifying Ring and navigate to a settings menu in the bottom right. The Unifying Ring appears, displaying your notifications from friends, Pages, Groups, apps, location history, and more.

Here’s one more button that lets you switch between apps:

Click on an app in the Unifying Ring and a menu appears. From here, you can switch apps from “All” to “All Settings” or “All Contacts,” if you prefer.
If you choose to leave these settings on, you can go to your app settings in the Unifying Ring.



Click on a new entry and a menu appears. After making all of these settings your own, you’re left there, but you can use Unifying Ring to switch apps and contacts, or head to Facebook’s site to change your settings.

This all sounds a lot like what Twitter has been trying to do with its own Unify feature, and it is. Twitter put some great controls on top of its Unify app to make it easier to switch between apps — not to mention that it’s put a lot more effort into Unify’s design.
Even if Unify doesn’t find a way to turn the tides, it’s worth noting that Facebook has gone after this space with its own standalone app Unify Connect. This app lets you see all of your unifying apps in one place. It seems as though Facebook wants to compete with LinkedIn, but Facebook seems to be turning its focus to LinkedIn and other companies.
It’s worth noting again that Facebook hasn’t put all its eggs in one basket. Last month, it launched a unified messaging app called Messenger. This is a pure messaging client, built atop WhatsApp and designed to integrate with all the other apps.
Facebook is also putting an emphasis on design. Last month, it redesigned Messenger for iOS and Android and picked up 50 million developers to build for Facebook’s platform. There’s no doubt that the social network needs to improve its mobile apps, especially Android, if it hopes to make Messenger a hit."
"A new mobile application called ClamAV, launching today at TechCrunch Disrupt NY and TechCrunch Disrupt Rev. 1,  is a social media aggregation service and social network aimed at helping consumers discover the best and most relevant content around them. The app is a competitor to a number of other apps and services aimed at helping consumers discover and share the best articles, videos, videos and other content around their interests, including Flipboard, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Tumblr, LinkedIn, Dropbox, and more. It can also work on those sites which have been around for some time – including for example, to create a newswire clipping service, as well as

”. And for those, who get caught up in all of those distractions of course, he’s also going to try to create ways for users to stay on top of the latest news. At the same time, Heins has already begun rolling out tools that let publishers automatically scan their traffic (which includes mentions, as well as comments from within the source) to view what it says about them. “We see this as a great way to give publishers a different audience for an audience, with a different audience for publishers,” he said.
The way that the service offers up these different types of metrics is through a link-into that allows them to drill down each piece of content, looking for any mention in all three versions. Right now, when Heins opens up the Android app, he starts off by recommending that users go to Linky (which is available for Mac) and then to his own site to take a user survey and take a more qualitative version of the data."
"Yahoo’s acquisition of Tumblr this morning has made a number of changes to the company’s business, including plans for a Facebook news aggregation tool to be used more broadly to cover not just a few stories, but content on the broader Tumblr network, as well as Tumblr user profiles.
The changes have now shifted the focus of the company’s advertising and entertainment products, as Mr. Thomas Korte, now vice president of Tumblr’s ad products, notes in a blog post announcing the news: “Today, Yahoo’s ads team has uncovered a new monetization model for Tumblr that will allow these advertisers to run targeted, highly relevant mobile and video campaigns across a broad range of social networks.” The monetization efforts will focus on mobile apps, he notes, and those that can sell video ads, as well as in-app purchases for games.
The blog post follows two other changes yesterday, which involve making the same changes on a smaller scale for Tumblr’s advertising business: an announcement that it would be transitioning a service called “Yahoo ID” to a more integrated structure; and the approval of another suite of Tumblr product changes, including new user management tools for managing and sharing videos and their associated merchandizing.
The news of today’s changes, Korte notes in the post, is being made public as Tumblr is preparing to go public. He says that Tumblr will use the $1.1 billion that it acquired from SoftBank earlier this year to help pay for those expenses, with an increase in sales and marketing spend. Also, it will be turning on some Tumblr advertising services as a part of that plan, he notes.
For background, Tumblr is a site that was created in 2009, first by two women, Molly Lin and Alexis Ohanian, then expanded by a team of men (including an ex-Googler and a civil rights attorney). The site has never really been formally updated, and the only updated information was around new content additions, like the addition of video ads and new social features.
The ads business, meanwhile, was one of the first to be affected by the timing of Twitter’s acquisition, when that was first linked to Twitter’s work with Tumblr to help promote and monetize photos on the platform. Tumblr’s ads division then became the de facto technology company in Tumblr’s ad program, a role it played both for large media advertisers (like Viacom) and for smaller brands (like Earmon, for instance).
It’s unclear just how much Twitter made, and whether that was part of the reason for the sale of Tumblr.
But Korte notes in his blog post that the new business in Tumblr’s advertising division is related to an API that he created with a Tumblr team back in late 2012, which now powers much of Tumblr’s commerce backend as well. This provides a platform for both brands and artists to manage all their online marketing and analytics across all their multiple marketing channels.
“Tumblr’s API enables direct access to Tumblr user data, such as interests, favorite content, and movements, through third-party sites and apps,” writes Korte. “These personal interests, movements and advertisers will be able to interconnect through Tumblr’s APIs and data feeds.”
In other words, Tumblr’s efforts with its advertising business may have provided a good business model for the startup, drawing users as the means with which to sell ads against those users.
To date, however, this has been the focus of only a small portion of Tumblr’s business: “Tumblr has always been a free site, ad-free to use,” he notes. “The revenue model on Tumblr has been, based on usage, a 4:35 ratio, and therefore, approximately $0.10 per user per day

 from what it says, that “we’ve come to the point when we need a good reason why [to offer] ourself you’re actually going to get sued if they do use our software.”
Another thing is what’s now becoming clearer is that the law is increasingly being used as a shield against user privacy violations on the Internet, because companies can now use the courts as a means to “get away,” if only you’re not being directly monitored by the government with your permission.
As a result, the startup says it has now expanded its “Safe Harbor” policy to handle the most common violations of its Terms of Service for businesses and consumers.
For example, they now offer users the ability to see whether services have changed from their Privacy Policy “to the Privacy Policy or the Privacy Policies of their competitors,” and, when it comes to data breach claims, it says it will step in automatically against a breach and notify the original user.
They also offer a “Google Alert” alert to let users know that their data is being used for analytics and safety and security purposes. And when it comes to reporting breaches, they provide a page with a quick email reminder that users can report or text a help ticket.
Now, it would not be a stretch for Twitter to say that the move to offer users some safety tools has also been about giving them better tools to manage their data and do better — despite the fact that some people continue to hint to Twitter as a place where some may not think of anything to add. The company recently added an e-mail report option, and has seen a spike of increased efforts to build better filtering tools by partnering with a number of service providers, including companies like Quora and TripIt, as well as companies like Twitter itself.
As an example of how people are monitoring Twitter as a place to report the data breach that Twitter had revealed on the eve of yesterday’s event in San Francisco, the founder of one Twitter user’s account, Brian Pokorny, noticed that his own Twitter account and the profile of another Twitter user had mysteriously disappeared.

The situation was brought to his attention when a number of his friends contacted him by way of a message — the same sort of alert that prompted his discovery of the hidden message generator in the first place.
(I hope that this is a thing you’ve been hearing from Twitter folks, too, since since other customers are going after the same issues as you see above. But to back up your own sense of security, you’ve got to take a proactive step to protect your data too…)
His ex-friend-turned-data-retentionist friend also informed him that Twitter’s decision to use a “stay-at-home” position to try to block his connection was a mistake.
Even with the option to click on the option to ‘block’ his data, his data was never actually being used. (He says his friend did, in fact. He has no further dealings with Twitter and the company, nor does he see any reason to dispute its decision to remove his data.)
His family’s disappearance also comes amid discussions about whether the company should have offered a “stay-at-home” position to people who had their data inadvertently exposed to the company’s data.
“We would have asked Twitter for permission to delete what we had asked for. And they said yes. And then they said, ‘Let’s take this data and do something about it.’ And that was the end of it,'” he says. “That’s not how Twitter should have gone about it.”
But he’s not the only person who feels that way.
Many, the company’s latest shareholder, Mark Cuban, who took care of his high school’s 8-year-old brother, hinted to me that the recent acquisition was a way to bring his two-year old brother, Matt, in for a few months to play football.
And that is where he also came across the fact that Twitter’s new deal with Universal Pictures indicates Twitter can offer a big win for Universal Pictures, a popular streaming-oriented film studio Twitter has a partnership with.
Universal Pictures describes the tweet as an “anomaly,” and some say it’s a sign of a lack of Twitter’s ability to create a lasting brand on the social network. The studio had been trying to raise

Elsewhere, the idea for the new app was not just to offer a more convenient way to check out the day’s news without having to constantly flip between apps and pages on your device. Instead, it also serves up personalised news based on searches you make on the platform and in categories you select (e.g. Health, Tech, News, Politics, Social, Travel, Sport, Food, Shopping, Events, TV, Weather) and in areas you specify, such as sports. You can also filter news by date, headline type (e.g. all stories in a certain period of time), plus Explore, Discover, and Explore by Topic.
Today, the News Lens app aggregates around 500,000 sources,, and claims to have around a 55 percent US market share, with its strongest seller being tech news sites.
The startup was founded by a trio of computer scientists: David Atkins, Joachim Schoss, and Karin Njlandersen. The three founders previously worked together at Nokia in their roles as Senior Exchange designers, Web engineers and multimedia specialists working on the Nokia X and the rest of the Nokia Windows franchise.
Schoss had previously worked on Nokia’s news service, which used to be the equivalent of a Newsstand store before Microsoft bought that business. “We were in the process of developing a news aggregator at Nokia,” explains Jones. “Basically, our objective was to create a “news enabler” that would make online news comprehensible to users,” he says, describing the problem the startup hopes to create in which a “fully responsive digital newspaper” that’s mobile and tablet friendly. An “app-optimised digital newspaper” in the parlance of the German press.
As an example when TechCrunch visited the site this morning, once the News Lens app is installed, users can browse through top stories from across all their devices, including Android, iPad, iPhone, BlackBerry and Windows Phone, while allowing them to tap links and images for each. One feature that’s unique to the News Lens app is its support for Android tablets – which, among other things, makes the app a great fit with the size and form factors of the smaller tablet form factors.
At launch, the News Lens app for Android tablets is free with ads, and those who decide to pay for the premium version will be able to see ten publishers. After that, it’s £5 per week or £30 per year – a few dollars cheaper than most news apps – and only for the premium version they may be able to access 10, or 20, or 25 percent of the content. However, there is one key feature which could potentially draw even more users: a way to create – in the words of Jones – “personalised” newspaper. One app at a time.
The News Lens was founded by two university students – one, James Jones, worked at Nokia after studying abroad; the other, Schoss, worked on the Windows 8 operating system while at Nokia. “We were really interested in how existing technologies could be applied to news,” explains Jones, “because that’s a focus for us for our future.” However, the design is still unfinished, with the News Lens’ “People” view of the news magazine somewhat stuck within that idea – it looks like a newspaper with more traditional styled layout photos, as does the blog on the left side.
There is another view which is less high-minded: Jones says he wants News Lens to be a “full stack” news magazine – essentially, digital magazines including apps, so that users can pick up stories on any topic. “That’s something that we don’t want to limit ourselves by,” he says. “We believe that the future of news is this: your smartphone becomes your primary newspaper, your main window into what’s going on the world.”
That doesn’t mean Jones thinks “news” consumers will care for news in any way, shape or form – but he notes that on Android, News Lens is currently not allowed to provide users with the ability to read news via apps. “There’s not any ‘search’ in terms of news apps,” he adds.
The News Lens is a free download here on iTunes."
"A San Francisco-based startup called AppGirl, which specialises in helping app developers find women who are attractive (and in some cases are willing to pay for), has raised $2 million in funding from Google Ventures, Sherpa Ventures, Betaworks and others. The company, which was incubated at Deltak Solutions in San Jose, California, has also acquired a previous startup, Dattch, a social game for queer women.
And the funding is also partly to pay for those initial marketing efforts at launch

"This could be the perfect week for Uber again.
The company has been busy building up the infrastructure of its platform, making sure all the pieces are working properly, ensuring that it can handle more types of requests than just trips. There are more than 100 different application points in Uber’s process that need to be processed through its platform, and the company is constantly adding new ones.
A trip is almost a more valuable transaction than an UberPool, for example, because it is not just for commuting, but it’s one too. The company said today that Uber is adding over 10,000 new driver applications every day to the system — and it’s looking to the future.
It’s hard to believe that Uber could have missed this opportunity, but it would appear there is a lot of competition in the transportation and transportation space. If Uber wants to continue adding new riders with more frequency, UberPool could be at a competitive advantage.
This article was heavily written to help Uber find out Uber could potentially play a long, lucrative ride with Uber. Uber wants everyone in this group and it’s likely that the company will figure out a way to continue to innovate along the way. Still in the ride we found some interesting trends that you would be interested in sharing and discussing with Uber. Here’s a fun one:
On average, you spend around $20/minute busy during a ride and around $3.10 per ride. What are the largest changes you do every 20 minutes? Well, you probably just change the lights, of course. And I would suspect that the app is also looking much more like a Lyft experience from now on.
This is a trend that Uber has been looking to trend in, but until now didn’t seem to have a way to share changes with other users because sharing a ride with someone only takes a small amount of time (as I’ve mentioned before).
However, the company has apparently been helping riders figure out how to share rides with others in the area for some time. This is the first time Uber has shared its user behavior — and, perhaps a way that Uber gets involved even more aggressively with third-party apps in hopes of becoming more helpful to drivers in the future.
Uber has also been working on how to better explain how its system works by giving more detail on how drivers can get a passenger and get their car off the door with a single wave of the hand, and how it works for different reliability reasons.
Uber has been making a lot of efforts to become more of a part of people’s daily lives and, that’s been a big win for Uber with users. That’s something that has more and more appeal, even if it’s not a huge success in terms of profitability, or whether the technology actually works. The bottom line is that Uber has worked itself into what Uber sees as part of the technology for getting car owners to hop on the app and use its service, and the only downside is another group of people who get hurt in the process.

"After its $1.2 billion Facebook acquisition came the big payoff for WhatsApp, today Chinese email company WeChat announced it would launch a new Chinese-language version of its messaging app for Android handsets. The new app, available here (Cyan Berry is providing the photos), will have the option of serving users in China’s different languages.
WeChat was founded back in 2005 by international tech giant Tencent and US-based social network Aol.
China has two major languages at the moment — Mandarin and French speaking ones, including Tm. WeChat’s main languages are Mandarin and simplified (Simplified) Cyrill, Kazakh, English and Portuguese.
WeChat, which is planning to release more languages, is one more Chinese messaging alternative to WhatsApp because it features services in Chinese.
But, it looks like WeChat also has plans to monetize in the country: its website and iOS and Android apps (which it only officially launched in September 2014, and has an Android app currently under development).
In some of the messaging apps, they will be localized for Chinese. For example, the official accounts on WeChat for Baidu, Tencent, Evernote, WeChat and many other app makers will be localized in the country. (That list can also be filtered across services — you might be dealing with Chinese versions of Twitter, WeChat or a social network, say.)
WeChat’s apps — which use Facebook like third-party services, as well as WeChat rival WeChat, plus additional third-party apps — will go live across China as part of

 with which it was possible to track how people voted? But the company had no meaningful traction until October. By November 2nd, the company had grown its voter file by a total of 45% to a whopping 57,000. And to make a point, the company reported that over three-quarters of all requests were from U.S. voters (compared to at least 50% for the rest of the world).
The founder says “we had no intention of looking into how we reached 20,000 voters, because our model was based on the premise that we were tracking how long it would take people to vote.” In other words, the company was solving a real problem. And as I pointed out, the company was coming up against an enormous, largely ignorant and reactive government in a very important election. This, coupled with an inspiring story of how a little company pulled off something rarely seen in politics, has encouraged many others to join the company and build a similar app.
But the fact remains that the technology behind the app is not in fact all that cutting-edge. You may not be able to download a third-party application that uses all of the technologies described below, on top of the various APIs the government used to issue to power its services, as these APIs define how apps run on various platforms.
The main platforms being used to interact with the federal government on election data, as it’s being done, are either iOS, Android, Blackberry, Nokia Symbian, and Windows Phone. One of the largest number of mobile apps available now is the official Google app for Android (which lists a number of apps including Facebook, Hangouts, WhatsApp, YouTube and Google Maps). Others are available on Google’s appindexer.
In the past, the company has reported it has seen anywhere from a handful of hundred to several million active voters interacting via their own mobile apps as well as the mobile web.
For example, the California state board of supervisors, Gregory T. Coyote, reported in a story last week that he had tracked 6,000 individual candidates in touch with the national party’s representatives throughout his city’s history. He found they sent him “90-character emails, which could include the usual things like endorsements, legislative strategies, fundraising opportunities, and just stuff like that,” Coyote said.
In a previous election cycle, the state board of supervisors saw a record-breaking 200,000 contests, which was so bad that many residents in the Silicon Valley area actually voted unpre-registered.
With ElectionData.org, the company aims to make the elections issue more manageable by helping people figure out where to turn on their mobile devices or landlines, or what to watch on their phones.
The company first began work a year ago, as a simple interface to add polling stations to your iPhone. Part of the company’s vision is to build an enterprise layer on top of that platform, allowing organizations, organizations, groups, and other clients to manage the vote with multiple pieces of data.
“The idea is you don’t need to have an army of people doing a massive amount of data analysis on your behalf of what will impact your business or impact your life,” explains Owlet founder and CEO David McInerney, when asked why the company is now focusing on helping people understand the impact of government with its open source data tools.
“In the 2012 Presidential Election you saw an extraordinary increase in turnout, which took place in urban areas like San Francisco, San Jose, and the Bay Area. And what’s astounding is the turnout among young people, who were some of the most impactful in the swing/losing the 2012 general elections. This outpaced the 2012 general elections, and we’re already seeing counties with young population of 25 percent turning on data,” he says.
The 2012 general election saw a big increase in millennial voters. Research by the non-partisan U.S. Senate and House of Representatives unveiled a study from earlier this year found millennials generally vote at a higher rate than generation timelines prior to 2012.
The company then built a panel of psychometric polls to help representatives candidates. These polls ask people who will be their Facebook friends and family, or their Twitter followers, so the companies could better identify influencers.
The company, which launched as an anonymous, social polling startup called Moneda, released an early version of their data this June. Since then, they’re now selling their polling tool to publications who can embed their polling data in articles, videos,

 for to use the app on the go,” explains Rosenblumman.
“The whole ‘Ticket Fire’ thing, we started doing that all late last year. So it was just easier than building it from scratch within the existing rules. So we’ve had some amazing successes out of it, obviously Ticket Fire has a very big user base who engage with us, and also its own travel agents have made over 100,000 reservations of travelers for more than 40,000 flights.”
While it’s still fairly small (as seen in the ‘Ticket Fire’ category listing), last we heard from Ticket Fire was getting some 250,000 people booking it per month, with around 4,000 transaction invites issued by Ticket Fire’s travel agents. It’s also signed up 1,500 transaction partners to use its technology, along with a further 2,000 agencies that pay up $100 per ticket booking.

The company plans to grow the business further, and to continue to offer travel rewards via other ticketing startups such as booking aggregators and hotel booking players, so it has a lot of runway ahead to grow its revenue before it runs out of its current funding target of $11 million. But at least now it has more runway to do so.
Rosenblumman said the idea to create a ‘truly consumer-driven’ travel experience was instigated as a way to solve a pain-point for travel bookings — by catering to both an active travel booking user and an economist. Initially that meant chasing travel booking typos but now the idea is that it will also be able to reach out to tourists, so taking in more data from travelers’ tripbooks to build a more comprehensive travel package.
“We can essentially look through the whole world of logistics companies and all of these travel booking platforms and figure out which ones and how many people are actually booking trips using travel cards alone. That should be a fairly easy thing since it’s not as difficult to do and it could be a big challenge for us. We do it by integrating with all of the existing travel booking platforms,” he says. “And then once we tap into their data we know exactly which ones of them are actually booking trips. So really we hope that can be solved by a consumer-based product. And this will also give us the data that we need which is very useful.”
Ticket Fire has around 1,600 agencies on its platform at this point, and also allows international travel agencies to add into its system via the app to support more organizations. “What we’re trying to do is make everybody feel like they’re working together, they want to do the same thing — a lot of this just comes from logistics companies, and we basically can turn these guys into hotels, booking buses and other things,” he adds.
While it’s launching its mobile apps only, Ticket Fire intends to scale its business beyond tourists and travel agents by tending to those users with a more flexible travel booking experience, as well as the ability to extend booking while on the go — by enabling them to do things like offer tickets without delay, for example.
The flight comparison app is being launched first as an augmented reality app, and has already provided some interesting data about users’ travel habits — for example it found that 66 per cent and 75 per cent of users booked their trips from the app, while travel is a key driver of trips, with 76 per cent and 27 per cent booking their trips by phone and 17 per cent and 25 per cent respectively booking trips in their native app.
The idea is to help people make better travel booking. The flight comparison app has been soft-launched in a handful of countries so it’s now working to expand its market coverage further and to push into new markets — as it does to help to power some of its other travel-focused features.
“We think there’s quite a lot of room at first for a mobile platform that is just plain good experiences that feel natural and good, like you just take photo apps from here, and you get the app. It’s pretty simple, it’s just pretty good,” says Rosenblumman. “We believe airlines and travel agencies will still use it — they’ll probably still use it. Also, people like the flight is fast, there are some apps that ask you

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
Today of the next few years, Microsoft is hoping to complete its vision of being a “social layer” that ties into every part of your computing environment.
This is all the more important when you start to look at what has and hasn’t changed for Windows since the introduction of the original Windows operating system a decade ago, and how that has led to the creation of companies like Groupon, eBay, Netflix, Apple, Groupon and Google.

It’s a similar conversation to that one about why Groupon and eBay are so successful, and their success in general is part of that. People are increasingly looking for ways that they can more easily and easily share their experiences — and they are also increasingly using their smartphone devices to do that.
When it comes to the iPad, an experience that is traditionally very hard to translate on the tablet is one that is changing through the use of different software, hardware (like the iPad), and different platforms. People are using iPad apps that make it very simple to create documents and spreadsheets. People are using their phones to communicate with friends and family on Skype. Using WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger you can do things that were previously available on Skype, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger — and things that people are increasingly using to do really well. People are connecting through Facebook to share their experiences, and those ideas are finding their way to the iPad:

This has raised the question of (re)bouvrirary question (where will these companies come from?) what role the government plays in this next generation of mobile platforms. There are answers already coming to these questions. It’s not just about the software: it’s about the underlying tech. As it turns out, in one of the most recent examples, Wonga Capital’s portfolio comprises five of these companies.
The four have emerged with varying levels of success, each in the range of 15-35 percent and typically growing at different rates:
Wonga Capital has run three different mobile platforms: iOS, Android, Symbian and Blackberry. Through their successes in recent years they have created one of the most successful mobile platforms of all time, making a strong splash in mobile payments and, obviously, banking services. The most recent figures for Wonga include mobile payments from mobile ads on Facebook; mobile coupons; and mobile games.
To be clear, these are mostly successful examples — not all of them have survived, but they each have helped the company expand its reach and engagement. When you think on the platform that Wonga has created, the list sounds impressive, in contrast to what you have seen in some of the other ventures that that Microsoft has been involved with.
At the last point, you can view Bing as a company that Google has had some very similar, if not identical, ups of the market to come, and has come back to the fold as a different entity with the same mission:

Microsoft has some two-thirds of its fortune from the Facebook platform. But at the right moment, there are those who believe that it still makes a significant amount of value, and at the right moment, those who still think some of these other platforms can be turned into real businesses.
I think it is safe to say that one big reason why the government was focusing so much attention on Android in the first half of last year, was because it was growing in importance by the fact that a good chunk of Android devices were running Android (at least five percent in the first half of this year and a million plus in the second), meaning that many of the phones that you would normally (or could have) had Android widgets installed on them were also running what Microsoft was building. So that’s a pretty important factor to consider. The other thing that this speaks to some of the emerging competition in the smartphone platform business today.
As it was getting going, Google had a good enough relationship with the government, and as we have gotten to know them, the work that Microsoft is doing with government officials is simply about trying to develop relationships at the same pace as it is with developers and OEMs. It’s about trying to do the same.
Q: Has the government played around with a Facebook app?
A: We haven’t seen that yet.
Q: Are you worried that Facebook could see the platform becoming uninteresting and engaging?
A: There are a lot of things that Facebook has in the works that have nothing to do with Facebook — which is a good thing because Facebook is already one of the most important platforms in terms of the use of social networks for the Internet. If you think about it, Facebook does a lot for the Internet — it is the most popular social network in the world, it can also be the most powerful channel for money-transferring money in the world. It’s also a lot of apps that the government wants to know and that the government wants to use.
It’s a lot of apps for things

"Today, it was announced that the UK government had approved the free access to a new Investigatory Drake (IDA); a law that grants police access to suspects’ mobile phone communications and web usage as well as their location.
The new regime, called emergency surveillance, effectively applies to police who want a more expansive and specific way to intercept and tap data relating to crime victims.
The legislation requires all investigatory data to be minimized in a process to be submitted for a ministerial authorisation before further information can be made public.
An exact legal disparagement of the technical disposal has yet to be made, but the government’s legal department is clearly thinking of the more expansive data-harvesting capabilities that privacy advocates are claiming for the state — not so long after raising €750 million to develop a revised data investigative scheme.
The government has now told Parliament that it will “plan to create a new law for the Investigatory Drake (IDA) Act to implement this new legislation”, adding to existing legislating law which governs the data-harvesting right for the police in England and Wales, to require a threshold of investigation and approval from the relevant Data Protection Act of Scotland, and which requires a prior investigatory review process before the powers can can be implemented. It’s doing this after a string of criticism to public bodies for using data to dampen investigatory capabilities on people planning future police investigations — including hundreds of hours of access recorded on ministerial data handling to individuals or the data of investigative mission contractors — and indeed the data is so sensitive to data being inadvertently cameratically intercepted or remodged on the grounds of a criminal offence.
But the government’s response to the committee’s judgement is not, in fact, clearly clear to end the legislative tide that data harvesting is a matter of public interest. And is also not clear enough to address widespread criticism of draconian investigative technology programs, which have been pointing out by privacy campaign campaigners as posing threat to citizens’ privacy. The latest example of that ongoing controversy — the case of U.K. security and intelligence agencies collecting data on electronic comms data via anonymized “junk data” being reported in an article today in The Guardian.
The Investigatory Drake Law sets out what the government hopes will become a general blue rail road with the authority to explicitly specify interceptive (aka: urgent) data needs to be authorized by a national security court.
The key criteria for the registration must be as explicit as “a limited period” is necessary with “informative purpose”, as the government has argued, although it also has also vague legal content that may elevate data registration as a discretionary recommendation when comprised of a range of factors. As the government has put it, “This is only a technical requirement for criminal prevention, not an end-to-end or a complement to our broader plan for policing the criminal market.”
The government is also making public observations about what “considers a trajectory from” intercept activity to data harvesting by public body bodies under the Data Injunction last year, and underline that the aim is to strengthen that complementary mission.

 know that the company still has a very unique and different approach from others in the field. And yet, “despite all the research, no one is finding any new ways to communicate with each consumer as well as brands.” In other words, while Branding Brand’s solution includes many of the features found in others, it doesn’t fall short of current standards. The goal is to add to this value by continuing to build the platform on top of the data science industry.
To that point, the startup has created its own “voice platform” via its developer environment, which is now available not only in iPhone app but Android (soon!) and now even available on the web. Using this platform, the startup is developing a system to help brands better communicate with users via voice, not to mention offering visual themes and sounds. 
Branding Brand says it will continue to use voice recognition technology in the product it currently develops for consumers, but it intends to use the new capital to further expand its offerings for brands. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the startup expand this platform’s offerings to other verticals in the future, like music, sporting goods and home decor. 
The startup has raised $1 million in seed funding to date from New Atlantic Ventures, Kepha Partners and Peter Thiel, and will be using the new investment to accelerate the company’s growth going forward."
"As we saw in London last Monday when two high profile figures got arrested for offences related to ISIS in the UK and Germany, the British and German public are now facing their first terrorist attack in Europe, and terrorist threats are no longer far behind, with terrorists increasingly using social media and video to communicate across borders.
According to experts and activists with knowledge of terror planning, it’s becoming increasingly more difficult for ordinary citizens and ordinary people, who are under a pressure that comes from increased government surveillance and security surveillance.
The rise of ISIS and the subsequent, swift destruction of communications infrastructure, coupled with specific incidents such as the killing of British soldier, killed by ISIS in Raqqa, and the degradation of civil freedom along the way, are, understandably, frightening.
As ISIS organises, its business model requires scaling across multiple sensibilities, creating a whole new challenge for security and intelligence agencies. But with the right technology, these agencies could be able to thwart or neutralise the threat by preventing acts by ISIS-linked individuals from communicating, meaning there could be a great deal more of these incidents.
So instead of focusing on what to tackle? UK startup Voz, which was founded in late 2014 and closed a $2.7 million Series A this year, is one option for companies that want to protect their intellectual property and carry out these kinds of attacks. 
It offers services to protect against data theft and online bullying over messaging, social media and online distribution — aka the ‘Black Friday’ scenario of ISIS: it takes a common market for the attackers to sell stolen data online to the criminals, and this data then has an outlet in the form of the startup, making it easier to identify and take back control at a moment of attack, with the ability to wipe data if necessary.
CEO and co-founder Will Price said the startup took some inspiration from the targeted market from online storage and file sharing – an analogy it is obviously rejigging to target corporate clients by, in Price’s words, “creating a template for companies like Twitter, Microsoft and Amazon who are able to take control of data.”
That market is undoubtedly ripe for disruption. And Voz will have to overcome an array of obstacles, not least having to compete with the likes of Kafin, Facebook, Box and WhatsApp to pick up new users and make inroads. It has raised just $300,000 in investment so far from backers including the Skype co-founders.
Its business model will entail a recurring subscription service aimed at corporations, with the kind of ‘paid’ term it does with other cloud storage services, taking the strain out of data protection and ensuring an up-to-date record of attacks and data breaches ahead of their detection – a far easier problem to tackle and a more lucrative one to solve.
Like its competitors, Voz is also pitching this to the corporations it’s working with. Its business model will involve offering companies with large amounts of data stored on their servers a guaranteed response in the event of an attack. It has a roll-out of more than 1,000 corporate customers so far, including Gartner, The Economist Group and the BBC.
Voz’s service will launch with an API allowing companies to integrate it into their existing anti-virus and other data protection systems for

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
Despite as we move closer and further from technology, it’s becoming increasingly clear that people will probably spend more time using social media than watching TV. It’s why people seem to fall back in love with Pinterest, and why brands have been willing to pay an average $60-per-user acquisition fee to acquire a loyal fan base.
These new consumer products will help social networks build out the personalization that has been so successful for years now.
If you remember, the rise of Twitter, the web-based social revolution that started in 2002. On one night in 2004, an entrepreneur with a few friends decided to build a platform that would become Twitter. The idea was that Twitter would become the connective tissue that would link all of the new social networks — Facebook, LinkedIn and even the old hot-bed social networks like LinkedIn.
Twitter, in particular, would have had to fight many odds against the industry’s elite, traditional media outlets and social networks (and others) to be perceived as the king of social networking, which would have forced advertisers to pay $1.1 billion in licensing fees and $5 billion in user fees. But Twitter would have had to fight uphill slogges and rally those defenses. 
When Twitter launched its website in early 2005, it was hailed as an untapped opportunity for the platform.
There were a hundred different new online, consumer-facing products launched that year to be found across the Web, such as Twitter, Digg (of Google fame), Echofon, Flickr, Quora, Vev, Twitter, Reddit and so on. And while all of these sites were initially focused around sharing text, a real opportunity for a new social network-focused open network would almost certainly have been to play the role of leader and not a follower. 
Then Google launched its first, and for years a great one, around 2006. And, finally, two years after its introduction, there were four new consumer-facing networks launching each day: Digg, Digg Friends, Echofon and Foursquare.
These new platforms saw their first significant breakthrough moment in the market, which was to democratize the online publishing business and, like Wikipedia, put publishers into control of their content. That could be considered a huge win-win."
"Mobile-first social networks could be the direction social networking should take, according to Taplytics co-founder Brett Martin, “instead of trying to make [our apps] go mainstream, we want to give a social layer with social sharing that’s native to it and easy to add new features and people quickly using it.”
He’s exiting Taplytics, the social analytics startup, and is moving over to start Building.io, a new developer-facing service. Martin says Taplytics had helped build the prototypes of the first version of the site and had worked on the frontend of the prototype, but wasn’t full-time about building it.
He’s starting to make some small investments — an additional $100,000 to build a bigger and better Android development app. The bigger idea is not making it easy to use social networks across the web, but giving developers more control over the users who use their apps so they can see how they affect their business. And in the future, he says he wants to bring Taplytics’ social features — the ability to share apps and blog posts, post to social networks, find users and invite friends — to Android first.
But that requires time, an established infrastructure, and a new headcount. (In addition to Martin, the company is also announcing a new talent, Chris Martin, who was most recently the chief technology officer at AppNexus, the Nook-maker that Google bought.) Taplytics has raised $300,000 in outside funding, while its founders include CEO Mark Ghermezian and CTO Mark Maceden.
The idea of Taplytics is to be a kind of “reverse-of-market for developer tools,” allowing big publishers to integrate more social elements into their apps without affecting their performance or revenue. One of the examples of the kind of apps users can see using Taplytics is this Tweet app for Twitter:

If you’re confused, that’s like a cross-app promotion network that tries to encourage app usage (the company is also announcing new integrations with Pitney Bowens’ Desktop Pro and the Hot Pads, a marketing iOS app) into a smaller app suite.
Martin sees his new service as part of a larger evolution of Taplytics. In addition to the services themselves, it’s now also introducing two new products. One is an API for developers who want to use more social features in their apps. (Currently, the API is being used first by Instagram and then a third, which

But that’s the difference. While Airbnb still sees its fair share of guests enjoying the experience while staying in a non-hosted apartment, if you’re sharing with multiple travelers at once, things are bound to become increasingly tiresome.
So, the startup announced today via blog post that it will be releasing a new application called HostSync, which will allow users to move back and forward between rooms to stay in the same place.
The co-founders behind the project, Raj Narula and Michael Gupta, said they came up with the new product to address one of their core pain points with current product offerings.
“We felt that the majority of guests stay in one place and then leave the apartment or hotel through shared rooms,” Narula explained. “You and your traveling buddies tend to stay in different places so it makes you weary of leaving your shared quarters.”
With HostSync, the idea is to give guests a way to move back and forward through shared rooms. For example, guests are able to move from room to room, which means the host can close the curtains to the guest and open the sliding door to their shared room. HostSync also allows hosts to remotely open/close the curtains to guests, so they can see their guest’s location and stay in sync.
The startup has also been busy expanding its list of supported cities, and Narula says it has roughly 1,000 homeowners and property managers listed on the site so far. This means that it now supports the majority of cities worldwide.
The co-founder says this is a direct response to feedback from its guests.
The startup has found that the majority of people who utilize Airbnb stay in one of the 50+ hostels and Airbnb hostels today. However, a few of the company’s early testers have chosen to stay in multiple hostels, including Cincinnati and San Francisco, as the co-founder explained.
“So, the way we look at where hosts go is that we look at how they move from room to room, so a host can walk from room to room and back again as they see fit,” Narula said. “We’ve been asked by our guests, whether they want multiple rooms or a shared location, we’ll try to accommodate that.”
HostSync is available now on the Airbnb Platform site."
"Fandrop, the online community for long-distance couples, is expanding to mobile. The app, which was just released in the App Store, is optimized for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
Originally created for couples in long distance relationships, and aimed at the longer distance relationship crowds, Fandrop released its app last September. In addition to a consumer-facing site, the app has grown in recent weeks to a total of 25,500 users.
Like its website, the new iPhone app is focused on two basic groups. Groups, which allow for long-distance couples to connect during the day, get access to groups that span two weeks, two or more days and can include people like a bridesmaid, or a good luck charm.
In addition, couples with a wild ornery spirit can chat with one other about their marital problems and the day’s plans. In group chats, users can share their running numbers, grocery shopping lists and tips, while also jotting up their sleeping tips. And if they see one of their long distance buddies or future girlfriends enjoying the conversation on Décor instead of staying at home, they can send an instant message to coordinate a road show.
The idea of a long distance relationship is nothing new to long-distance couples, but their implementation of the feature is unique to Fandrop. This is more of an app meant to encourage more of these kinds of relationships – one which takes place asynchronously – as opposed to a chat-based interaction. After all, the app allows couples to Skype chat for hours or even minutes at time instead of only minutes if they are using Fandrop, while sharing memories on private networks. (And yes, if you love cats, we mean cats.)
Fandrop originally debuted in the beginning of October as an online community for long distance couples, which then expanded into a private Facebook-style networking community for long distance couples. But a month ago, the app expanded to also offer a private private chat function, which still allows these long distance couples to exchange texts, voice messages, and voice and gesture messages, but also provide them with private access to shared calendars, too. The new app also makes it easier for those in long distance relationships to find one another.
The updated app, however, has only been available in that particular geographic region for the time being.
According to CEO Jeff Cavins, the new Fandrop app has been in the works for an hour or two with

 if they go and try this. Or they can go to the site themselves and see which sites like that are doing well. The site itself works somewhat like a news aggregator of its own — it asks users questions about particular pieces of content and has them vote for that piece of content. When I asked how this is different from traditional content sites, Wozniak says, “The most important thing we do is offer a news aggregator, which we think is really important, and that content is then ranked and ranked by human editors who are tasked with keeping that content up–to–date… In our case, the only difference is that we rank our site by human editors and hand-pick the content that’s actually interesting, not by humans.”
There’s not much else in the way of back story here besides that — I’m not sure I like it that much — but it does seem that the design of the website, for the most part, is reminiscent of the old Scoop.com, which itself once used anonymous content in an attempt to make breaking news faster — a website that never really grew in popularity after its initial popularity was limited to a few techy college campuses. It sounds like Gtrot is trying to re-establish the Scoop brand for this website, which in my opinion is a lot better looking and more practical than the Scoop.com of yore, where all the content is so easily hidden and always comes with a disclaimer.
“We use your name, and trust you,” says the website’s CEO, Alan Nadel. (I asked about this but he declined.) “But in reality, our staff is not anonymous because, we’re human, we’re not the scrupulous kind to keep those types of things off the record. That’s why we put in the user ID, you don’t need that.”
I’m familiar with the stories coming out of Gtrot and I personally like the idea of crowdsourcing news articles, and, while I don’t have huge issues with Gtrot potentially being a little overused and maybe even borderline “anonymish”, that sounds like a step in the right direction. Especially when it’s not really a surprise to see an enterprise company like Cisco or Citrix or IBM be so transparent about their own business, they still have to be accountable to their users.

"A new report about the state of the global financial technology market from Gartner highlights some of today’s biggest names getting into the game as sites like Craigslist and Ask.com are going arms with sites used more specifically to solicit and remove ads from email lists.
Gartner notes that one-third of the world’s 1,500 financial centers are on mobile and that one-third have mobile apps, accounting, credit rating, trading and filing, and three-quarters are mobile.
The report also points to some other interesting stats around mobile banking services. About half of global mobile banking is now a business or in business. That also means two-thirds of the total online banking market is now mobile.
Meanwhile, mobile banking services are up by more than 60 percent while the overall mobile investment is now about $3.5 billion.
In some contrast to what people believe, mobile apps are not only on the rise — but they have reached the #1 free app position every month, Gartner notes, at the top of its category worldwide. (Gartner data about mobile apps is not being shared publicly today so far.) There were only 1.9 billion mobile device apps in use globally with more than 40 new apps released per month, Gartner notes. But it also found just 46 percent of mobile users, or 214 million, accessed Facebook’s native mobile app. This is even more of a leap than the ~1 billion mobile apps in use worldwide that came in at ~95 million last year, Gartner notes.
The report also notes some of the big winners in the mobile banking app game, including Snapchat, which had more than $53 million in mobile banking by the end of April, while LendingClub Messenger reached around $11 million in mobile by the end of April alone.
Snapchat, and another new entrant, Mobiya, got to $46 million in mobile services a little over a week after launch, while Mobiya reached $22 million within six weeks, according to Gartner.
It’s a lot of buzz to be having a Snapchat-like service like these, especially given that so many other services in the market have been shut down or are pivoting away from mobile.
M-Pesa, for instance, pivots away from offering banking on your phone to focus on your real time transactions as well as working with

” and Fischer.
“I was actually on the hunt for an independent, small-run company in my own area because I needed assistance from the local community and wanted to build something that could solve problems for everyone else and become a sustainable business,” he says.
As a way for the community to help with the project, it has put together a volunteer advisory board which includes people like local creatives and business owners who will contribute as volunteers as well. These will include artists, photographers, bloggers as well as some dedicated volunteers. The board is going to start on Friday and run through the weekend.
Sebastian says the aim is to get a small group of “vital contributors” to test and experiment with the concepts and come up with the idea. He believes this will also allow them to experiment with “the commercialization of this concept… if they understand and like what they see in the market.
“The main idea I want to achieve is to have something which is not reliant on donations or just-in-time donations. Which means that it does not depend on the users going, just on the community, and that’s where I want it to be from the outset,” he says. “I want to see if there will be problems with the model on a commercial level. And what will happen is, well, it’s the users who will start complaining and say, ‘look this is free, this is a free service and we want to use it but we want something more.’”
The initial pitch will be specifically relevant to users of the freemium Sebastian website — but will be available to all users when the initial alpha release is launched next week.
“But we’re not going to make money from this product until, for example, we reach a certain scale and scale of users — but even then the revenue model is not going to work as it will be based on usage or some payment structure that will be fair,” adds Seb.
“The model we like is that for every new user that the service can get there’s enough revenue to reinvest the innovation that comes into the service, just so we could use it. That’s all the feedback we’ll get… and we’ll iterate and improve what we’re doing in every possible way until we make a really big, sustainable business that people feel they deserve.”
The initial free product will be ad-free, as this blog details. The team is also planning a freemium version of the site that will offer a range of limited (but free) features for some users, allowing them to test out and experiment beyond their own private data, such as their personal preferences and purchase history.
After this initial offering will be made freely available to all (and probably more than) Sebastian users, with the team planning to build a freemium tier and business model around selling access to a premium tier based on usage/delivery sizes and other customisation options.
They also note they may look at ways to generate revenue in future by using an affiliate partner model — given that model involves the sell of products and services.
On the ad business play, Sebastian says they’d like to partner with “some very exciting businesses who wish to promote their services… We’ve got nothing to announce at the moment,” he adds.
The new funding round brings their total funding to just over €1 million, and they say they’re not currently looking to seek investment outside their home market. So they’re not currently seeking external funding, as they focus on raising their initial seed round.
The three co-founders are relocating to San Francisco from London to build their first product, and are looking to raise a seed round. So they may need to raise more funding to get their business the money they need for a first product launch.
Judges Q&A
Q: I mean, I have your page there… just so you know it’s going to take some time to get up this marketplace
A: It’s actually going to be very hard to scale this thing because it requires us to re-learn about business models around commerce from scratch, scaling, and then I think it’s going to be a difficult thing to scale and grow this way, so that’s why we’re raising money from our home market and using the US Venture capital where we’ve already done a lot of product development. It’s a hard thing to scale in a

’t have to.
To find people to share those specific apps with, use the “Find Friends” feature.
Once these conversations take place, you’re given access to the person’s contact information — and it’s yours. But, sadly, you have no idea who they are. (Unless, that is, if you sign-up with Facebook.) This is likely a combination of the people you’ve communicated with, based on their LinkedIn profiles, or for the fact that they’ve contacted you with a specific app.
If you’re wondering why so few apps have actively been built around this type of concept — and why it took Google+ so long to open this data up — Google answers that with a somewhat unexpected way: “Because it’s not for everyone.”
And on Google+, this type of interaction with its Facebook friends can go either way. If someone follows you personally on Facebook, then he or she won’t ever be able to see your friends’ most recent interaction details, nor will they be able to see what you’ve learned about all of the people you interact with on Quora.
The same is not true for Google+, Twitter or Foursquare.
Google says it will continue to collect and store people’s Facebook interaction data, but is also trying to find ways to combine that data with it’s existing Google+ user profiles, but in a “logistically robust” way. That will be important to keep pace with Apple and Facebook, which are also building that database into their own proprietary systems.
We’ll see if Google+ is able to make this type of analysis that Twitter can do in the future, too.
Update: Here’s how Google+ user Prof. Bob Lee looks at the problem. His initial post was based on the idea that “users would have a much easier process of reading social updates that are public” if they were on Google+, and then “everyone would probably use it too if they had it.”
His follow-up: “I suppose every person who was on this site and logged in through Google Groups had a Google+ profile. In any case, the point of discussion was definitely to show a user’s Google+ social graph, but the data was definitely public for everyone.”
He also suggests that there could very well be an opportunity for Google to build a Google+ client specifically designed around this type of thing — someone like Facebook’s own implementation of this (which could also get integrated into Google Analytics).
(And, to be sure, yes, we’ve heard from a couple of high-profile advertisers who were happy about how the service was handled, with particular focus on video ads. Again, for Google+, this type of analysis could indeed help drive traffic, but also with a Facebook-style product like Twitter’s to create an appetite for more engagement. However, the reason for the ads being shown in the first place was that they came from Facebook, and that a Google+ profile is required to keep those profiles up to date, to start with. )

"Munoz, a mobile payments startup based in Mumbai, India, has joined the ranks of the Y Combinator-backed startup accelerator program. Though not as flashy as Square or Alipay, the firm is working to create a mobile payments system for retail businesses.
While startups like Alipay and Paytm are working hard to expand into online payments, including mobile wallets that would allow more consumers to join loyalty programs or make financial transactions with cash, Munoz has decided to focus on a different business. This is a technology startup, and it’s applying for Y Combinator’s attention.
The startup was founded by Pankho Divya, who studied product design and worked in the advertising and publishing industry. Divya said they looked at existing payment software and online banking software, and said the combination of technology and design was necessary.
“It’s not about desktop based software,” Divya said. “Munoz is going mobile.”
The firm announced its beta program last week and has already grown its footprint to 60 merchants. Last week it added a few thousand merchants to its service, and has processed over $500 million of payments over the past two months under the startup’s platform.
The founders are taking the mobile approach. They’re not trying to create a fully formed smartphone app, and instead offer a mobile-related mobile wallet to merchants.
To make its service work with the current dominant cash use platforms, it needs to partner with the biggest one, iZettle. It will work with iZettle, an affiliate of the European number, as well as other technology partners.

 and we think it should be available everywhere but we don’t think it’s necessarily the right time right now.” That’s the problem.
The team has spent considerable time talking to the press, and presenting technical details, but few consumers are likely to take the time to see how the product actually works.
The product, from what I’ve seen in public presentations to a picture of a rough prototype that was thrown around a few times, doesn’t look like it would have been an easy sell. However, while it’s very impressive from a technical standpoint — but not if you factor in any of the other problems that plague the world of consumer Internet services — the actual user experience, or the experience it offers on the devices that people use, is far from perfect.
A service as I have seen, the same one that I’d found nearly 10 years ago — the one that was so far ahead of its time that I would have made some my own bets on it, because no one had really nailed it yet. That’s about the same thing as buying a new phone. It’s definitely time to consider for a moment whether a company that has been able to succeed in this space understands that it would be a challenge to turn something like that into a product that meets consumers’ current expectations, or if the company would have made a bet on an entirely different business strategy, because of the way it’s been perceived. (Either way, I think Google’s Android is a good start, if only because of the potential market, but also because even that market is evolving today.)
One thing that Google is clearly betting on, and what it will need to offer consumers in the future, are features that make it easier to use a Chromebook for all the everyday tasks that they have to remember to even for that briefest of time, like turning on Google services or setting up Gmail accounts.
That will be important because Google has a bit of an advantage here as one of the platform’s most prominent properties. It is a platform with a very strong brand association with Google and the user experience it offers — and even though most people would probably never associate it with a Google brand, the brand is enough, and the content is there, it just’s very convenient to use from.
With this new mobile application, Google will likely be working against the existing app ecosystem — and what it’s trying to do better than just with this new app. (It wants to push for the fact that you need to have it there to use it. We’ve heard that you have to register for Google Drive or Google Drive to access your entire computer.)
As it has become the web’s largest and most powerful piece of real estate, Google’s cloud has become home to a lot of other proprietary and enterprise applications, many of which could easily be turned into products, just like it has with so many other products. One place where this trend will go is if you have it; in my own experience, the service is far from the kind of platform where people just happily turn it on and go about their business.
On this front, Google may have the advantage with a user experience that will appeal to more mainstream users. With a product as user friendly as Android, which already has the kind of mobile devices that some find so interesting, we might not really need a standalone app, but it could be a selling point.
In this way, it could also help to differentiate Android from its more open and collaborative app-friendly cousins. It’s not what you would expect to be the kind of user-friendly — but more user-friendly, maybe more of a home for developers as their users shift to new devices.
The other side of that is that Google may have the benefit of being more open to its users, even when they’d like to be able to keep their own product with them. The company’s efforts around Android One, its paid Android launcher that recently saw one of the highest product rankings ever for Google software downloads, are also encouraging more developers to use Google’s hardware.
While it’s been interesting to watch Google try to continue doing what it has been doing, even under new, larger and more powerful owners like Apple, Microsoft and, of course, Shazam, we’re still far from that happening in a way that is satisfactory to me to most of my usage of the Google suite of products.
As it turns a lot, Google is just making more of a push by trying to create things that it doesn’t just like, but do so in a way that will make sense to users.
And even if you are the kind of person who does not like the idea of the entire Android ecosystem being controlled by a single company,

 in or near the top). The goal of his study wasn’t to provide scientists with a model to predict the success of a particular cell line or an individual cell; he wanted to provide a rigorous method by which the team could be able to determine whether the model could predict the success of a cell line and even distinguish different populations of cells belonging to the same cell line, while also determining which cells within that line are in or out of the cell.
To accomplish this goal he developed a technique he calls “on-the-ground vision”. This is a method that measures the position of all the cells in a sample, as well as their position within the sample. For example, they can take samples in the field, then send an imaging team to the hospital to look at the data collected so they can determine whether the cell lines or the individual cells at that sample really belong to the same population.
When the results show that the cells from the same sample do not have the same density and depth of penetration as the first sample, they can determine to which cell lines have been invaded or not by the invading cells. When they find an invading cell, they note this to the team and say so to make the decision on which line should therefore move out to keep pushing forward. On-the-ground vision is important for determining cell density and penetration and is particularly important in determining how quickly an invasion is occured. For example, it may take 24 hours for a full-strength invasion to complete, whereas a diffusion curve can last a matter of days or even weeks.
He has shown that on-the-ground vision actually correlates with high-frequency, low-impact infections or low-impact (read: non-existent) infections. “That means we can get a bead of similar infections out of a person infected with a different virus,” he said. In other words, this is a new way to predict when a cell infection might occur.
The technique used for his research does not have the advantage of providing a result that’s clinically measurable, but it does allow researchers to see what the impact of a single infection might have on many other microbes living in an area or that had recently been infected.
“The thing that we got from that was that it had a good fit with laboratory culture, so we weren’t really comparing levels of that infection or not of infection. So we did quantify the level of, and the level of, as far as bacteria were concerned, but in most cases we actually wanted to be able to measure more because we were actually getting more information out of that sample,” he explained. “Once we developed the technology for that you saw that we can actually distinguish between infected cells and healthy cells.”
This allows scientists to identify a range of common infections that may be important to specific industries or researchers, and it can help them learn which microbes are potentially immune to infection. So far, these experiments haven’t been able to determine whether infection-associated bacteria are more or less infectious than, say, infected components that have evolved on the bacterial side.
“We’re making a big push on developing this technology,” he said. “There are thousands of scientists who have gone to bathe in it and we’re getting a lot of grants for it, which we expect that we’ll be able to fund in the next year. It’s kind of like a science-funded warchest, you see all this data, and once you do we can actually start taking action.”
He will take no equity in the new startup, but is looking to bring on board the two full-time employees at the end of April."
"It looks like the annual TechCrunch Mobile Conference will be held this year in Santa Clara with a bunch of companies in the startup and enterprise spaces. This year the companies include a mix of consumer and enterprise companies, including VMware, Google, Twitter, Salesforce, Box and Dropbox. One interesting company will have a “presentation” on the subject of customer experience management.
As Ben Williams from Fast Company notes, “there’s no shortage of companies taking part in Mountain View’s mobile conference, but it’s interesting to see who will be exhibiting thanks to a deal that has been in the works until now.” Here are the full list of those who are expected to see something else. In the past, conference attendees have included companies like Box and Twitter. The theme this year will be “mobility” defined as “the use of your mobile device to interact with whatever your company wants or need.”
Here are some ideas from the presentations that I expect we’ll be hearing in the future, that I’ve heard."

 Skalls have been a bit of a mess in recent years, in part with issues around issues around throttling and usage of data that is not strictly necessary.
“This new generation of innovators and disruptive entrepreneurs is going to change the ways we consume, like what happened in the PC, and mobile, and TV,” he said. “They're all going to be hungry for innovation and new ideas, and that’s something we want to be a part of.”
Beng said that as mobile computing continues to grow, it should have an impact on prices because it will force existing customers to choose between the two. “The more mobile devices are used in this new digital economy to pay for broadband, the more prices will change,” he said.
Aldridge noted that while some areas of technology have become commoditized while others have not, that doesn’t mean that no alternatives are going to thrive. He suggested that things like mobile payments would “bring more connectivity” to the existing stock of payment information on mobile devices “because it removes the friction” in that process — and it can also help to provide alternatives for those that still have to pay for a paper magazine and a computer.
“There is an enormous, worldwide need for us to communicate today, and this is a new business opportunity that is tapping an existing supply of new Internet products,” he said. “I still believe we have time to invent.”"
"Nestio, the real-time collaboration tool for home improvement professionals, is now launching its first iPhone application. Though it had previously been available on web and Android, the company has yet to make a push to iOS.
The company, founded by former real estate agents Rafael Reffelbach and Andy Zihertz, launched an iPhone app this time last year, Reffelbach says.
It took a little while, but the iPhone version, Reffelbach tells us, worked with over one million users to create its first users, which have continued to download to the 20th day since the initial app was launched (the most common user is someone who has used the product in a month). Today, there are also over 200,000 users on the product page.
The company has raised nearly $300,000 in seed funding from 500 Startups, and other angels including Peter Rize, David Langer, and Rob Cocker, the owner of the New Orleans Hornets.
Reffelbach says that a lot of the interest in the iPhone was due to its more consumer-oriented use case – instead of having to “friend up” with a potential contractor or homeowner, Nestio’s app allows for more collaborative features, including bill payments, invoicing, and direct response to messages.
The average customer price on the iPhone app is $4, which is significantly cheaper than the average on the web. However, because of the platform’s potential to scale up in terms of its business, the company has priced itself to be an iOS application. (The desktop app is still free – you can switch to a browser. And the website is free as well, though you can also get some “premium features and services” in the web version.)
“Nestio is here to stay,” says Reffelbach. “I can’t really see why a lot of people wouldn’t upgrade just to the smartphone, that’s where the business is.”
The real estate industry in the U.S. has become a huge market, with sales expected $5 billion this year, growing by $2.4 billion over the past two years, Reffelbach notes. “There’s a whole subset of the market that is underserved, [which we can call contractors],” he adds. “This new generation of homeowners and contractors…are really hungry for the services that we offer and have a very specific need they have…behave very carefully.”
“We also have had a large number of the ‘whole family’ customers who use the product, from professionals to folks who are basically getting their hands on property management,” says Reffelbach."
"The rise and rise of smartphone ownership and usage in Europe means more room for disruption amongst carriers in order to keep up with demand over their networks. That said, Telefonica, the parent company of this company, is not immune to what is currently happening.
Just earlier today, the carrier reported that it is stepping up operations to build up its network to serve more customers who are choosing to switch to smartphones from older devices, such as feature phones and BlackBerrys. The carrier will also get up to speed on Blackberry, Nokia and other legacy iPhone devices.
Telefonica today has announced that it will be laying network wires to new locations

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Report on the app’s lack of any search functionality — as with other services such as Flipboard — and what it is doing on the platform: linking to other content, including social networks and more. It will be interesting to see if the “social find” concept — being fleshed out in more ways than one.
The new search features are not live on the new Flurry app yet, but when it does arrive it’ll be in the form of a separate app, with all of Moutan’s other search features such as keyword tagging, as well as filters for “people who are your friends”.
Moutan says that on the new search page it’s now incorporating other sources of content such as “people who are online now”, that you probably follow on Twitter, or that you have on Facebook. Flurry’s ranking algorithms, meanwhile, tells you which other social networks are important to knowing which content is worth tweeters and tweets are trending.

Moutan said the new search features will also allow it to start working more closely with content owners on its social recommendation service, to help them build custom search “experiences” for users, based around things like locations and people the influencers tend to follow, for example. That might mean more customized discovery that’s more personalized.
“People are good at knowing a pretty extensive set of real-world connections,” he added."
"When it comes to travel planning, the online platform trips, along with other competitors like Expedia, Orbitz and Kayak, recently hit a wall. A year after launch, its algorithm that power-checks trip odds and helps decide which to fly, has become obsolete.
Now, with that said, Jetpac is not an online travel planner — it’s a mobile app that tells you which to go to and when to go.
To determine the best travel, Jetpac looks at a site’s data on certain variables like time of year, number of sites, ideal traffic, etc. We can just look at this page and immediately be able to make our decision.
Jetpac’s main display looks something like this, which I thought would probably be more accurate, but it’s a bit of an odd choice.
Jetpac is a travel app that shows you things to do in just 45 seconds. But instead of a single shot to answer that question, you get narrowed down to four different sections.
Section One: Traveling to your home country or visiting your home country requires a minimum of 4.5 hours of travel (or 2.5 days.)
Section Two: Your home country takes 4.5 hours and is popular. It can take 3 to 4 days.
Section Three: Your trip is popular, but you are traveling to a different country than from your home country. In other words, you are traveling by time, not by time. You are given 5 minutes from your intended destination to complete the journey.
Section Four: Traveling to your next destination requires 3.5 hours or 2 days.
Jetpac, in an effort to focus on making the user experience more lightweight, uses a grid-like interface, so that you simply drag the various sections you want to go to where you are able to pick the best option. As you swipe, you use your finger to scroll through the lists, as well as use the app’s “in case you lost it” feature. You can also swipe left to raise the question.
There are a number of times when you go through the process that make the overall product less useful, and I’ve seen Jetpac more than once get stuck on an issue, though, which is frustrating. (The same thing is true over and over again in my life.)
As traveling to your intended destination, it can be easy to see if it all makes sense. Jetpac shows you all the traveling options and all flight-to-and-home details with each category, and this allows you to get better information.
You can also swipe right to keep reading the options.
Jetpac works with your home country, so if you are staying in one place, you still need to book your flights via Jetpac. I can’t say for sure how accurate this latest version is as I haven’t played with Jetpac in some form for past few months, but it is worth noting that this is very much an iterative update and Jetpac only gets better over time.
Jetpac is a three-member team based in France."

 lower that Android tablets are generally outpacing. But with Apple still holding onto power behind the 7.7 mm and 6.35 mm formats, we’ve got very little data to go on yet to back that up."
"In a blog post to the website TechCrunch, Microsoft’s Craig Shee stepped up his role as Microsoft’s global CEO today. Shee was named the company’s CEO last week, the two announced in separate announcements on their respective blogs — but not in their official statement on stage.
Shee, a Microsoft veteran with a long history in computing, has been doing a job. He is not new to this job: after selling his company CocaCola to Intesa last year, he took on the CEO role at SAP last Thursday.
The new role includes suggesting new hires to Redmond by way of his blog post notes on the blog — “I don’t think that the people in Washington — people who hold power and position in the Microsoft, Tech Community — people who make decisions, and people who don’t — they should be working this day and doing this day. I don’t,” he noted.
At SAP, he was instrumental in the process of moving the company into Microsoft and then out into the markets for the new model. One of his most important moves at SAP is that the company’s CIO Sharshaw Ray confirmed the details of the “next phase,” as he put it in a recent interview.
Ray is best known as being behind the sales push with the hiring frenzy at Amazon of all things, although he also took on CEO responsibilities for some of Microsoft’s more successful moves. So his post on Friday is focused specifically on the business, as the two leaders speak about how the company is moving forward.
Here’s what Ray had to say when he was asked for his opinion about the announcement and what we know from him about what it means.
“We are in the exciting, epic phase of our growth.”
He’s also, of course, the guy who founded Microsoft for the most part. The big challenge was getting the large-scale companies to sign on the dotted line. One of these might be SAP, which has about 20 times as big a customer base as any other SAP company in the world except perhaps Goldcrest.
In any case, Hee has to think back to when Microsoft was in the business of his life — when the company wasn’t just the biggest threat in the business world, it was the biggest threat to Apple and Android. He also has to think about how he can help as well, as he has to be a visionary about how to transform SAP — from a company company that has built a lot of software tools into a world-changing company with a massive client base.
“We have to create a world-class company, one that changes SAP.”
You know, Hee is also very excited about SAP and why the company is not just his idea to take on that role.
“I was there from day one. I didn’t start as CEO until the last meeting.”"
"Last week, I wrote about the story of what a college kid named Adam Jensen did when he named his bar the “Beast Bar,” where he served some horrible brews, and then made the switch to the CEO role.
I’m no expert in all this, but it’s worth noting that more than half of my friends in Denver, Colo., have a number of books a few that I’ve encountered on my iPad, for instance, that have not quite made the cut.
Jensen has become a popular person on the Denver scene during all the many years he’s been in bars, bars and restaurants in Denver. It is, in part, I’m sure, that there is a lot he has learned since he moved out of town.
It appears that as Jensen’s profile has been filled out by the media and friends of his bar, the Denver-based bar manager/sales guy that first invented the “dude bar” nickname in the world of bar names, he has become a folk hero. His friends have noticed the similarities.
He went from the dusky bar in the basement of the bar to a big room that you would come across before heading into the office. When he talks to the crowd about the place he’s taken to become an “ex-CEO,” he says, “I can’t tell you who he is. He has the gravitas; it’s just awesome.”
While it has certainly been a rocky time for me recently as a new bartender, I

 the company’s most recent funding."
"Snapdeal, one of India’s largest e-commerce companies, is getting into food delivery. It will build a cooking school inside its logistics centre; invest in the construction of a fresh bakery and a lot more.
Food-delivery. That’s what the company is doing now as well, launching recipes for a healthy curry-food and recipes for home cooking. Food will be provided by Indian recipe centres and “high-end local chefs”.
(The recipe for a creamy and healthy vegetarian curry-cooked meal is below.)
India’s food-delivery play is interesting, not just in terms of cost and scale but because of the capital that it demands. The country has a population of around 180 million, yet only 22 million Internet users, so one in five mobile users in India visit online food sites regularly and takes to Facebook to query what they should be eating.
Food delivery in India, however, makes more sense on two levels. In addition to getting people to cook more often, Snapdeal is taking in a tremendous amount of orders that its parent company will need to service.
Food delivery, unlike Uber, takes an average of just 10 minutes per order (including delivery). That’s quite a lot and this is actually one of the reasons Snapdeal is doing it this way, while Uber has largely built it into its app so that you can get on-demand food delivery within just a few hours of ordering.
This is not simply about getting people more engaged with Uber, though — it’s about providing a better experience for drivers to complete orders and help make ends meet. On the supply side, the company has also invested in several food delivery startups across the country. Whether Echoing Uber’s reputation as a very ruthlessly efficient service will help it in its new home market, we’ll see."
"The U.K.-based VC-backed startup Oxygen has run a competition to develop better fuel cells electric vehicles so cars can power their own internal renewable energy.
It’s aiming to use existing hydrogen cell technology for its cars to help reduce the use of fossil fuels to low energy density electric cars.
Oxygen’s primary focus is on the U.K. and Europe, rather than with plans for expanding elsewhere. But it did also make an investment in electric car startup Tory, which has a partnership with Tesla, on the same continent.
The company, which recently raised a $4.8 million Series A (led by Octopus Investments), has put a range of hydrogen sources online. And for power it’s using solar cells. It’s aiming to use those solar cells to power a range of electric cars.
In a blog post announcing the competition, Oxygen co-founder and CEO Ethan King said: “The Hydrogen Technology Alliance is also creating new and innovative hydrogen fuel cells which could significantly reduce the use of fossil fuels. The Hydrogen Alliance is an agreement-free alliance between OXYGEN and the Hydrogen Corporation to bring hydrogen’s power a range of car manufacturers and car models that will be able to generate a range of electric vehicles.
“This marks a significant leap forward for our industry – electric cars must now be able to provide affordable energy, and our Hydrogen partnership will lead to a shift to zero carbon-based power,” he added.
The company has previously committed to invest in companies building “high-quality, high-efficiency” electric cars."
"Finnish phone startup Jolla has finally taken the wraps off its first Fonera — a dual-OS handset, billed as a smartphone with two running Lollipop OS by Taiwanese company Cen, rather than the E.U.-dominated Sailfish OS.
Its latest press release lays the groundwork for Jolla propositioning itself as a dedicated e-commerce play, but Jolla is evidently planning to make some more radical changes to its platform, via the Fonera app store.
“After having spent a lot of time learning about the Fonera I realised that there are people who are very interested in fiddling with Android and trying new devices. This is very clear, I think, that these people have really different use case. And we’re very clear that we should not do this as our company but we had the idea for Fonette. We understood this was a good way to create a special solution,” said Cen chief product officer Tina Ciepich in an interview with TechCrunch.
“But when we looked deeper into the data

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
A million dollars in new financing, valuing the startup at $5 million, according to a statement by the company.
We have reached out both to the company — which was founded in the US in 2001 (its first funding was a $100 million raiseback from the European Founders Fund, in March. It says it’s been profitable since 2009, and in a typical fast-growing business, has a customer base of 20 million members and 40 million users — the latter figure suggesting it is continuing to grow at the same rate.
What’s the valuation for a startup that offers so much of an answer to the challenge of finding people for the very long-term, instead of building them in a more transient manner? Well, not less than $5.4 million. And that’s $4 million — nearly twice the $1.2 million valuation that we have heard earlier.
“It’s crazy considering how many users I have,” said CEO and founder Niketto Marietti when he first made the move. He is part of the family in the building of most of the company. “The valuation and valuation has not surprised me,” he said.
While that money is going to buy the next big release (Marietti says the next is due this summer), this whole move also points to some consolidation ahead, in which the main target will eventually be the “home services” part of the business more directly and indirectly than in the current direction of the company.
It also points to Mauperti’s evolution as a company, although he didn’t want to talk about just where the company is or where it is going next in the future.
If in that regard, we are hearing that it’s ahead of the growth curve and that there is more in the cards for the end of the year, along with more investment.
It’s for these reasons, that there exists a bigger plan behind the acquisition, along with the earlier purchase of an internal tech team in the city.
“Our first aim is not to change the direction of the organization,” Marietti said. “Our long term goal is simply increase the number of home services across our footprint. We had a team in Hamburg doing this in the last year, now we plan to expand further into Hamburg over the next 12 months or so, and bring even more tech to the area.”
It will certainly be good news for the local-German startup scene and a very welcome news for users of Mauperti, a location that not many other startups in Berlin will be able to effectively claim. One reason why there certainly wasn’t a lot of growth there in the last two years, despite the influx of startup energy from Silicon Valley, is that it is very low-hanging fruit, and difficult to scale once you have gone from scratch.
But it’s also very convenient to look at the acquisition and think that, by selling HomeHero, the company got access to an effective and potentially very wealthy entrepreneur who could invest well in order to expand its reach in Europe.
(And also in Germany: well known for being in the home cleaning game and having some happiest business in the tech space ever.)
The HomeHero acquisition is a huge exit for the Berlin-based startup community, which has been growing fast in recent years and was only a few months ago in a period when no one was investing in any of the startups that were getting launched there. Matsumura told us that’s now changed, and its future is now more obvious as it gets to grow up and produce its own commercial business.
Part of that may also be down to the fact that Berlin, while a magnet for starting a company, has also held the attention of investors. When HomeHero won a placement in Startup Alley at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2014, it said Germany’s number-two startup ecosystem — Berlin+, Wunderkinder/Rocket Internet and Active Venture Capital are among the startups that will be using its platform.
Matsumura, who sits on the board of home services via his ‘home’ service Vendetta and has invested on multiple levels — among them the platform he founded, an active lifestyle marketing site and a social media company, is apparently well on his way to a large exit — but this was by no means a home run for the company; it was the acquisition that raised the most eyebrows.
For Matsumura it was an early sign of that fact. “We were very happy to have our German partner on board for the next stage of the development,” he told us when pressed on how the HomeHero exit could change

 CS, SAP and MongoDB.
In the announcement, IBM noted that some of the key data that its platform can provide is the ability to view and manage clients, customers and business units. IBM’s blog post describes its Big Data platform as an open-source implementation of the REST architecture, based on IBM’s Cloud Foundry technology.
At the same time, IBM is giving a glimpse the platform’s potential, with Brick Markowitz, the company’s chief security officer, pointing out how, with just under a minute, IT can set up automatic updates, such as making new customers aware of a potential data breach.
On the business unit front, the blog post included a company photo of a lab setup where a IBM researcher showed some of the technology to a group of security personnel.
IBM is betting big on its security credentials, with its investment in cybersecurity company Maritime Software. Maritime is a company which has raised about $65 billion in funding over the past decade."
"Last week we were introduced to the latest in Qualcomm’s new $35 mobile payment initiative. The initiative was a long time in getting off the ground in which the company is partnering with third parties to offer, promote and promote “mobile” service.
The initiative was first announced at the Mobile World Congress tradeshow back in March, and then announced through an event on Twitter but not the company itself. With the news about the partnership on Twitter, that seemed to be the only event that took place – but now there are reports that more companies are involved, including the likes of EMC. These include a “significant number of partners” who are making investments and joining a programme or group.
“We have partnered with a number of leading banks and will soon see more banks and other large businesses join the programme,” a spokesperson tells us.
It’s not clear if those banks are being enticed to jump aboard the bandwagon; a “high-profile” investment is more likely, given that the initial business is going to be based around facilitating payments within larger entities like banks or mobile carriers — but there are plenty of other startups looking to get a foot in the gate with a somewhat complementary technology.
One of the firms in the initiative, mPay, says it will be working with financial institutions, and possibly other customers — such as SME-corporates, retail companies and private companies — to develop its technology.
And although the company is not naming its partners, it says it’s involved in a program, called Coda, in partnership with Spanish mobile network AltaGamba — to � help accelerate the adoption of Coda. AltaGamba is a member of the EU-Council on Europe’s Mobile Economy and Consumer Regulation group, and the organisation’s head on the project is Joaquin Castro.
If the relationship with mPay works as advertised — and the bank claims that it hasn’t had any problems yet (as not everyone uses the same bank); there is also the possibility that mPay will integrate with EMC’s own mPowa or may simply come up with a product of its own.
The mPay spokesperson says that Coda is also available as a white label offering with other EMC customers, as well as mPowa and its partners “in other countries to use the mPowa platform”.
The Coda tie-up is a strategic one, given the scale of the initiative. “We are helping to advance the role of financial institutions as a technology platform by developing complementary technologies to enhance mobile connectivity,” said Laura Santolaria, Chief Technology Officer, Coda International, in a statement. “Through integrating mPay technology with AltaGamba, consumers can seamlessly buy and receive money, replacing the need for bank transactions on the move.”
The first mPay partner, Telefonica-owned Ipanema Venezia, confirmed the partnership with telegraph.co.uk,  confirming the news in a statement and saying that the mPay technology will be integrated into Telefonica’s instant-line mobile wallet service, Line Pay, which is currently available for a fee.
The first mPowa mPay services will be launched in March 2014 (with mPowa, and Mountain View-based Instant Payments also mentioned in the statement), with a broader white-label service launching at a later date — possibly on a wholesale basis, if you can believe that.

 phones and tablets.
If, then, the company is to go, it will almost certainly have to build out these new business units, too. He could also simply apply the R&D to the new tech, as it would be better able to spread the word.
Ijima is just the latest in a line that has included a smart air purifier that raised $20 million from Greylock Partners and others. And that’s after another connected purifier launched last year that was raising $2.5 million in April, which is also aiming to eliminate exrusion by building for wireless power.
(So maybe we’ll be hearing a different tune from here.)"
"The U.K.-made Valkee is a fitness worn tracker that attaches to the back of your bike to act as a warning device when you crash off the bike.
The device is a fairly technical endeavor, with an advanced wireless chip, that can detect a number of different types of events over a couple of seconds, including engine failure, traction jerking, a rear brake attempt and a number of crashes.
However, the design of the device is rather chic. In some ways it resembles a GoPro or a Fitbit because displays appear on the device — and there’s even a slight resemblance to the Garmin, with the exception of the color (black) — and the number of event alerts.
You fire up the device with a tap to start recording. After doing so, you press a single button to stop recording. The device automatically starts playing music for the first 10 minutes of your ride, with pre-loaded Playlists. The music consists of different tunes that are recorded in succession, and the user can pick one up on the fly.
That said, you will need to tap the button a lot to continue recording, as the battery will last 6 months so you can’t record if you forget to press it.
The Valkee features a wireless range finder, to replace the need for a built-in GPS. It also has up to 50 meters of range, meaning it’s much more than a 10 mile bike ride into action.

The wearable splits your heart rate, calories burned, your calories burned and your speed to an internal record, and you’re then given a history of your activities, with a particular number associated with each, over the last few rides, if you have an iPhone or iPad nearby.

It records all this heart and weight data in the cloud so you can replay it live, including activity like pace and a long dash of your pedaling (via GPS) — in the process focusing on heart rate rather than fitness metrics.
The device has a 3D sensor so it can tell whether you’ve fallen off — and it can even help immediately if you don’t. If the sensor can’t tell if you need to move at speed it will immediately start recording and it’ll automatically replay your workout.
The device does also includes a temperature monitoring and fitness-logging function — so it can log your activity and sleep data. And it includes a pedometer and pedometer.
The San Francisco-based startup behind the Valkee, Valkee, launched back in November, and has just kicked off pre-sales and is getting its new wearable to its Kickstarter backers.
In its backers’ test period the team has received more than 5,000 pre-orders, exceeding that amount at the time of writing, with the earliest segment of pre-order customers being the HTC One, Motorola and Sony.
The device starts at $99 for the first 2,000 backers — or $30 more than it’s typically priced. It’s also now available in China. The team will be refunding any backers who don’t receive a Valkee via Kickstarter by the following post, for a simple shipping update."
"BlackBerry’s BlackBerry Passport, the BlackBerry Classic and BlackBerry Q10 devices, rolled out in the U.S., Canada and the UK last month, but today the company is getting some word that it is opening up the doors for pre-orders for the BlackBerry 10 and BlackBerry Q6, BlackBerry’s newest smartphone line, with the announcement that an email has gone out to those purchasing BlackBerry devices via BlackBerrynet, the mobile carrier’s BBM service.
The email has this to set the record straight, but it is still short on details.
The BlackBerry line of BlackBerry smartphones ships with BlackBerry OS 4.0.4 out of the box, and BlackBerry 10 is a portmanteau of BlackBerry OS 5 and BB7, the latter of which is BlackBerry’s current flagship operating system.

 first time in Q4, and is forecasted to continue to miss this record as the year progresses, too. It has also since announced plans to bring the BlackBerry Q10 to the North American mobile market beginning at the start of the New Year. More importantly, the company has made some significant internal changes to its leadership lineup.

CEO Thorsten Heins steps down as president and the former CEO of enterprise software maker Jive Software, where he oversaw the creation of BizSpark, a program co-founded by BlackBerry founder and CEO Carol Davidson that provides mentorship to students on “big data” and encourages open-ended thinking about how to collect, share and make sense of data. Fellow co-founder and COO Brams Garber is taking over as president.
Meanwhile, Stephen Spindler of Intuit, a partner at Reed Smith, is taking over as director of marketing and business development. He replaces CEO Thorsten Heins’ (formerly Jive Software’s VP of product) role."
"There are still a lot of unanswered questions surrounding a number of Apple’s headphone offerings, ranging from simple portability to battery durability, and more. A new rumor from Chinese news site Ming-Chi Kuo claims that the next generation of Apple headphones will have multiple port options, but that they’ll be called “Thunderbolt 2” and not “Thunderbolt,” the USB power adapter that currently ships with the iPhone 5 and 5s and allows you do a number of interesting things with the adapter, like open the gate behind them and insert your cables directly.
These headphones will apparently offer just three ports each, as it currently is with the iPhone 5 and 5s, with each one either used for audio or other input. A fifth port could be used for power, as the 5 and 5s will apparently also pack a 3.5mm headphone jack for use with headsets. The port also offers a proprietary port for data transfer, and can connect directly to your device’s charger, which means Apple can replace the Lightning port on them with anything with a Lightning cable that’s more designed to power iOS gadgets.
These headphones will include Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity, as well as 3.5mm input and output, and a small 3.5mm headphone jack just for the microphone. The base Lightning port is a very useful feature for changing volume and switching audio channels without having to change to a hub or external amp. Another USB 3.0 port should also be included through the headphones, as is the HDMI or USB-C socket.
Multiple external ports seem like a very natural design option for a device like this, which is a smartphone you carry around in your pocket all the time. The Lightning port can also be changed to a Micro HDMI port for ultra HD content Netflix (or 4K video), so users who currently have to resort to their iOS devices for that feature could finally start to enjoy that great, ultra HD TV remote control.
The headphones should ship in November, but they’ll hit shops and Apple stores in February for $100, with a suggested retail price of $299. They cost $100 more for the regular models, which also include the Lightning port and optional iOS headphone adapter.
Apple hasn’t offered any firm pricing on these headphones."
"Apple’s iOS 8 mobile operating system, tvOS-based tvOS platform in some ways feels more like a traditional TV effort than a new way to interact with the cloud, and a new set of interactive apps that bring that to life with third-party developers. But it’s an ambitious platform that’s likely to have its own problems, and with that, developers need to be in it to get started. With iOS 8, developers are finally able to push their native apps into the iOS8 home timeline where their apps are available across all of Apple’s devices, whether it’s a desktop, mobile devices, smartphones or tablets.
The platform is being supported in a beta version for developers, and is officially rolling out today to all developer partners through the iOS App Store. The APIs made available through the iOS 8 framework include the ability for any developer to use an ‘if/then’ clause for any event, regardless of which method that user is attempting to initiate. The best example of this is the case of an event being launched, where it might be launched as soon as the user presses the “launch on iOS 8” button, but if they press “launch on all of iOS 8.”, there’s an “if/then” next to it. This is much like what’s available today on the Web with CSS3 in the form of a video-hosting service, for example.
The new APIs make use of live tv content as a fallback source for launching apps, and they’re designed to support dynamic scheduling,

“We are proud of our part in this project and will continue to support it for all of its significant stakeholders,” said CEO Paul Dettmer in a statement. “The success of this project demonstrates exactly what we’ve strived for in recent years: creating jobs, increasing incomes and helping families get the most out of the system.”
The project is actually a new initiative from the UK government as it seeks to leverage the UK’s massive telephony network to compete with the likes of Google and Amazon, who are among a number of companies that are already offering global reach via networks of narrower lengths than the average terrestrial phone signal and the mobile networks of European countries, with the most obvious connections to those being telco’s own infrastructure.
Indeed, as you can see from this map, the only non-Caratix service on offer is the very basic £30 mobile network, although the other two main providers, Orange and T-Mobile, are also offering network access elsewhere. In other words, no coverage for a very basic mobile internet service.

It may be surprising to anyone who regularly uses cellular networks for their own broadband in the UK, but that is indeed a problem. Caratix’s service works best when the car is plugged into a car’s OBD port, meaning that it can take advantage of a very rare and expensive third-streaming standard that allows for much smaller traffic loads. This is even more important here in the U.K. as a whole, where traditionally OBD has typically had little to no meaningful market share based on installed base or actual number of devices.
“We always wanted to offer full spectrum coverage in all markets, but I think the UK is already well-served by our Caratix network, so actually getting the OBD, which is not something we can really achieve at the minute — if you think about OBD, it’s too damn rare a rollout,” Nick Wicke, T-Mobile, VP of marketing of mobile networks, added in a statement.
The company is also trying to lure in users to buy “connected cars” that connect their cars to the car’s OBD. This is a different proposition to what the automotive giants have in store with their own connected cars, with Caratix’s Caratix offering a “car-only” service, not just a “connected car” solution.
This differs from the similar concepts Caratix and others have been offering over the years. For instance, Google in 2016 also unveiled a Caratix-branded ‘automotive platform’ that touts various partners and guarantees a platform of “five year-old connected cars’ within a year, and a driver management service that enables the individual owner to retain control of their vehicles. Caratix’s Caratix connected cars start at £499/$650, while the driver management service is priced from £9,300/$49,950.
“We’ve been working hard to launch the programme in October”, says Nick Wicke. “We’ve got a lot of the components — the automotive platform, the car-only platform, and now we’re really having to work on that final package.”

“We are also going to be looking at things like customer service and what happens in the customer service part of it when people who have been sold as a customers start saying ‘I’m going to have a car I’ve owned for more than a decade now',  which will eventually change and that’s the sort of thing that we need to address,” he adds.
Beyond that more public and commercial focus, Caratix is also hoping to get a more direct line to the customer from by being a direct line of communication with the company, something that some other independent Caratix members are currently doing. This includes a new car-buying platform that aims to simplify the painstaking process of buying a driver and keeping the entire journey online, including being completely cloud-based.
The new platform is also being used to advertise the platform, be it directly, or via it, to existing Caratix customers. The former is a particular focus, with up to 1,000 “budts” that are free to post to a driver’s social network, providing a much wider opportunity to drive traffic than the smaller (and more expensive) updates and updates for the platform themselves.
“We do have the ability to advertise to existing customers but we just find that for now we do not have enough Budt

It’s one thing to have a lot of cash. It’s quite another to have a critical opinion piece and a company you help change things that you believe are in the right direction. We’re on the cusp between two extremes. We think crazy and we think the right way. The best ideas are born at the intersection of extremes. The best things come from close listening—and that’s exactly what we’re trying to achieve with Clarity.
The problem of too much power creates an opportunity of excess: The startup that takes that power, gives it to others, and then the cycle of success repeats itself. If you want to build a company, you have to have a ton of cash. But because we have money, we have an opportunity where we’re able to go and other companies follow us, and that puts us in an unusual position.
We believe that money is the magic ingredient that will separate us from everyone else, and that’s why we haven’t seen others do that. We are trying, unsuccessfully, to build a caldron at an arm’s length from everyone else in this game, which will hopefully bring us a crescent. It will be hard, but it’s a path we can take.

"There’s big money, and money, and a fat, mean pig.
But how does Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO and founder, know it?
The Facebook founder famously once joked that the only way to make money is to put an advertising board in front of him. It makes sense.
This one’s just that: A Facebook cuddly bear.
When Mark Zuckerberg was hired by Apple as the VP of engineering that came along with one of the most coveted patents in Apple’s arsenal, he had already been given a cudgous, chauvinistic air: Like the father of two toddlers that would occasionally bark at him.
So what is it about the man who was the subject of ridicule at first for giving his approval to a new idea, he has seemed to understand, even if only barely.
Zuckerberg is famous for being a patronizing, arrogant son of a pet. The idea, like this one, came out of a research lab and come with a hefty price tag.
His quest to bring Facebook technology to the the enthusiasm of cats and dogs was one of the first big successes in the Facebook game.
The game was first created by Roddy Pickett, who had started the design team at a game engine in 1993. He joined Facebook. He became the “chief tech architect” for the social network and architected all the back end systems for all its various products.
He’s also given the credit to having helped build a dog-centric, affectionate, intelligent companion for his pets. He introduced the game to his friends dog and got so stupid.
Eventually he got it. He won the right to sell the game on the Apple App Store, and he won with his creative heart.
He has given his life to developing new ideas, and now he is even getting to the point where he actually owns a dog. This guy isn’t going to waste time pimpishly running around trying new games like a dog gets to play ball.
This one is also hilarious to everyone, even if I don’t know quite what to say with it.

This is another great example of why startups don’t need VC money. A friend over in my friend’s basement was talking about how great the future is and how he is about it. He hates VC (evil money) so he just wants to grow his life to the full potential it can be. He gets a kick out of it.

"What happens if you have enough access to over-the-top (OTT) routers and switch to the router for your entire life?
After years spent fiddling around with it, iON Software Engineer Paul Farmer has managed to create a highly integrated, fully customizable router that can deal with every imaginable router imaginable, from routers to Wi-Fi hotspots and the N routers and the routers that connect them to the router and the Internet.
The system is fully configurable, enabling a customer to configure it however they like, supplemented also by back-end management. This allows the router to connect to the Internet and communicate with apps and even without an Ethernet chip, according to Farmer.
The router is as much about a piece of hardware as it is about the software, and he has taken a total

“Mobile, mobile, mobile — how about a mobile application called BeamIt for iPhone?” reads the intro for what turns out to be one of my favorite startups of the past year. (In fact, it probably helped to create some of these photos of mine.) If you haven’t heard already, it’s because I’m currently sitting at a coffee table in Palo Alto, and I’m “reading” about mobile, mobile, mobile. As a result, I feel more energized during nights and weekends and, I’m convinced this is just one of the startups that will get me thinking in terms of “how many apps am I keeping track of?” — so that I can focus on one thing, whatever it might be: Building an app.
The most common response from founders to my question was yes (or no), and at the exact same time, my co-founder and the sole technical lead at Javelin Venture Partners (as well as an investor in my current company, One Mile Clean) was saying no. (Except he didn’t). And we were talking about mobile startups. (I had planned for him to say maybe five years ago, but in fact he said he didn’t have the right answer. So we decided? Here it is.) What about mobile apps? What about mobile websites? What about apps? The question raised by each of these answers is interesting. There’s no one answer to it, per se, and I’ve gotten better at this question over time, and as such, it’s probably not a particularly good way to track your startup, product, or its ecosystem.
Here’s a list of the mobile startups that I tracked while at TechCrunch, and a breakdown of what happened.
When I was at my last startup (which was a marketplace for wedding dresses), my wife and I went round with every possible solution in terms of traditional metrics, and we settled on using Apportable for our search-based shopping and fashion-sharing service for women. It was hard but we had a couple of competitors already — we called the company Mimi, and the other was called Flore. They were really good for certain things, like sorting our Wedding Express online. There were a lot of challenges facing the startup, and a lot of challenges dealing with funding, managing teams, etc. — those things are true of any startup — but they were all manageable.
When we reached out to VCs, it became abundantly clear how hard this space is. VCs are pretty hands-on with the companies they invest in, and they are trained in other areas. Sometimes I would tell a VC: “Yes, we should do a seed raise.” (He had, already, raised a portfolio company in the same space.) Sometimes I would set up a small raise (a couple of hundred thousand dollars) and sometimes I would wonder if I would do it. But, I’m just talking to a VC and asking him, “When can you get in?” I hope we don’t talk about this thing so soon that he doesn’t notice.
I then had many good discussions with a few other people in VCdom and a few other accelerators, looking for advice on how to raise — they all told me that the cost of raising money on startups has gone up, and the terms of the deals have changed. I felt like this, that when we talked to the VCs, they seemed less and less inclined to invest in the startups that were “on the path”. This was all good for me, and I felt like I have an opportunity to help entrepreneurs in building businesses, or at the very least get them a lot more comfortable raising money.
I’m not the only one. And this is why I think we would be better off investing in our own companies.
It turns out that raising money can be daunting, and while it’s not a bad thing, it can be an even harder process than it sounds. I’m not talking about funding a startup,” said Steve Schachter, Managing Director of Entrepreneurship and Innovation at Javelin Venture Partners, in a recent conversation at Disrupt SF.
But it still can be a daunting process — as if most VCs don’t understand how, let’s say, a VC at a VC fund doesn’t understand that he’s involved in the startup. (Or at least he’s not going to try. I actually got the same question

It says that with new models of consumption happening in an offline manner outside of traditional book rentals and sales, the company believes there has never been a better time to develop the eCommerce solution.
Indeed, the online retail space is so fragmented and crowded right now that one firm, Reed Elsevier, estimates that it has more than 800 book sellers in Europe alone.
As is often the case, however, this is eCommerce in new territory."
"When Facebook introduced Groupon-style discounts to Facebook pages in 2013, many assumed that the offer could potentially become something with just as much staying power as the social network service itself – but then they didn’t add much. But Facebook appears to have been iterating on that.
Today, the social marketing company has introduced a new feature that lets businesses post directly to Facebook from the News Feed rather than having to rely on Facebook to advertise that the offer is real life, or not. And also to avoid confusion about whether a post is a Facebook or other social status, like a post with quotes or a tweet, for example. But again, if the post includes more than Facebook profile photos (and links to the business’s Instagram website), it looks like that might be viewed by more people – especially when the offer is “promoted” to more people.
In other words, Facebook may get closer to giving businesses a better way to reach customers on the social network, while at the same time increasing awareness of the offer, too.
Some of the new sales and promotions from brands to specific Facebook Pages are also starting to get rolled out in advance of big products launches for other brands in the future.
While it’s unclear exactly how often Facebook will roll out these features in the future, a few early reactions to the new feature seemed to suggest that it was about to launch a new feature specifically.
That is, if the new feature actually gets rolled out to any user, and the social-ad targeting goes well (especially in cases where it’s more of a test than a feature), it could be introduced in time to better target the business side of Facebook’s business push.
More details appear to be emerging here."
"Facebook is on track for the world to sell 500 million mobile phones this year, and a recent study shows it’s already adding new data shows that 500 million mobile phone subscribers is a healthy percentage of people in the U.S. alone. And that’s only if you use apps, not just Facebook.
So it’s smart for Facebook to take a crack at translating its billion-dollar core to mobile with its new Open Graph app. That’s right, Facebook isn’t just a portal for users to add Facebook content, but also a storehouse of their interests. It’s mobile Internet.
Facebook had previously revealed a small percentage of its US monthly users go beyond Facebook Login to a specific device. But no one is quite sure if that rate is more than zero because it’s the percentage of people who log in, not how many log out, per quarter. And with 100 million unique mobile users, the company has an awfully strong shot in mobile data.
And Facebook’s most recent usage stats help verify those numbers.
A study we conducted at data-driven business intelligence firm Apnicom shows Facebook leads everywhere in terms of smartphone usage. Only two companies had more of the top 100 most positively cited numbers, as you can see above. It’s a strong sign that Facebook has more global aspirations in its vision for the future of how we connect and interact with the world.
That doesn’t necessarily mean the whole world is going mobile, but it does look like Facebook is doing what Facebook is doing best at the moment — providing a central platform for users to do so.
It also might have come to pass in that the vast majority of people still on Facebook are spending most of their time getting online, not on their mobile devices. I can kind of see that argument being more of a stand-alone theory over time through Facebook’s expansion to be more of a mobile-first company, but it’s a little hard to believe that all your Facebook posts are being consumed on mobile devices."
"There’s no doubt that Twitter has become the biggest, most influential social network in the world, and there’s obviously a lot of opportunity and demand for a company of his size and scale to do well. It’s important that these guys get off the ground and provide a solid, sustainable business and for a long time I suspect we’ll see many, many smaller-scale, fast-growing companies start to struggle mightily under their respective Facebook Pages and other like-minded corporate entities.
Twitter’s been around for exactly the last five years, a time when it would be quite easy to build off the back of two early innovations,

ables that are on social networks and would be eligible to use the new funding. He says that Facebook’s focus on social products is a strategy that allows it to get away with a focus on its advertising business.
“We’re going as far as the social network,” he told The Financial Times back in Jan.
To be sure, the company has been branching out for years on the world of virtual reality. The latest incarnation of Oculus was built on a Facebook-powered first-person-somewhere engine, and it’s about time that social networking services like WhatsApp run inside the social network too. Facebook is also already starting to see what a mobile Facebook may be able to do with its Messenger service — which uses a chat-like interface and lets people send and receive virtual gifts.
One thing that the company missed out on was mobile payments. It did say that Messenger would finally support mobile payments in 2013, but that was years before the service had gotten real-time mobile payments off the ground. (And no one’s going out there with that goal, I hear.)
While that might not be as big a deal a product as a platform, the company still missed out on what is popular on mobile, and those are probably by no means high on the app stores. And for that very reason, Facebook is pulling up with a lot of competition from the likes of Google and Apple on the web.
Now Facebook needs to do something about that. Facebook and WhatsApp, which have become more mainstream, have found themselves in the position of being the first out of the gate.

“The reason there are lots of competitors in the chat space is because there is no good platform to work on,” he told the newspaper in Jan. This is also the reason there was a gap between the two companies. “There are tens of millions of people all over the world who have hundreds of friends.” This is an area where Facebook has yet to really get a foot in the door.
“I think that if you asked 100,000 people to buy something, one hundred of them have bought something,” he added.
The acquisition of payments will allow eBay-owned PayPal to extend the kind of services that it was already offering to merchants — they can now integrate social features into their shopping experience, he noted.
But this is an interesting start with PayPal at the very low price points. The company has just priced its mobile payment service at 1 cents per transaction — that’s a lot of money for a small business that probably needs to make sure it gets enough foot traffic.
In this case, the acquisition makes sense for eBay. Merchants already take huge amounts of payment in their hands to get what eBay wants them to sell, and so this seems like a natural way for PayPal to push its business forward.
What’s the price range you’ll see?
There is a $99.99 minimum, the company said, with no maximum fees. That’s pretty cheap, particularly compared to what Square charges for its $99 per year and 500MB of credit, and even more expensive for some larger retailers like Amazon — Amazon currently charges $99 per square inch per item.
And these merchants have the extra opportunity to use the payment feature to push “the right channels,” and for eBay to try to get people to try out the features and pay for them before trying them out for themselves. (As one eBay employee put it, “There is no easy way to support this.”) And it also gives the company an even bigger customer base. The typical small business Amazon typically targets is the 1%-5% of the customer who pays with PayPal. That’s right, the company is buying the way Amazon is selling its customers.
He said one reason eBay has chosen this price is because the PayPal integration kicks in after a merchant already accepts payments with PayPal. A number of areas where eBay will work with Facebook to enhance the merchant’s business are very straightforward — you go to Craigslist, and then you might as well switch services for eBay.
I asked him if eBay is also working with more payment options in the future: for now, eBay seems to be focusing on the basics — one-time payments and single-purpose access for those who have been shopping for a small business for a while now.
And for Facebook, he said that it’s the only way forward.
“Our mission is to get the right user experience, and one place from Facebook where we will be seeing a significant user base is the payments space,” he said. That is a reference to the fact that Facebook has chosen to keep the payments services for people who use their phones for things like connecting with friends.
“It’s a natural extension. When they buy

 on a new iPad. The iPad is designed to support touch gestures, similar to what you can see on a traditional keyboard, so that you can use gestures to control other aspects of your device, such as adding new photos. You can even control the wallpaper, and the color of the home plate covers the screen – it’s like a BlackBerry, but more familiar.
The keyboard is responsive, too, so that you can use the iPad in a number of different situations, such as being on your phone while you drive, in your pocket while you get ready for a meeting, and in your pocket when you’re not at your computer.
The app SwiftKey has built its keyboard to be compatible with Android and iOS devices. So it’s a pretty handy tool that will hopefully also work with Samsung devices in the future.
The software – and the UI – is beautiful. There are text editors all over the place, and you can use the touchscreen in order to interact with the keyboard and the content, as well as swiping to navigate around the tablet. You can reply to things in real time, and the entire keyboard becomes a sort of digital keyboard, where you can type and hit the SwiftKey key button to input an instant message.

SwiftKey also integrated with popular cloud storage company Dropbox as a backup option. It’s going to be really good to see SwiftKey making such an effort to integrate with other companies as well, such as Box, so that you can collaborate and work on files with SwiftKey as well.
I’ve used the keyboard a couple of times already, and it’s a very useful app. If my girlfriend doesn’t use it, I could see how it could become a key device for me as she’s driving her car."

Every weekend, someone spends a lot of time creating a compelling, if a bit tedious, video-based message to explain their app, business, product, or whatever. They even make fun of it. Today, this hobby hobby hobby is dominated by a handful of well-known “messaging” apps, mostly centered around private messaging and instant messaging, such as Snapchat, or more recently Facebook Messenger, Path, and others.
Many of these apps are fun, but fail to generate mass traction because they’re all focused on a single use case — the former is about communicating with a close friend, but the latter is about communicating with hundreds of strangers. Each app is valuable in that it serves one function and excels in that single use case, while the downside is that the app is very new and may not become as essential as Twitter, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Line, Snapchat, WeChat, KakaoTalk, and others.
This is where things could shift from the “chat for X” startups to a “messaging for X” startup. Imagine being able to search for and display the video messages sent through WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, Google Plus, Viber, Weixin, Skype, Weixout, Mixer, Weixstick, Path, Flickr, Google Maps and more and then chat with each of them, asking and answering questions about the content (while having fun doing it). Yes, a “messaging” app for videos.
We’re not going to just clone the fun but look for significant social increases. Let us get there.

"In the 1970s, “the day of the fat boy.” — a phrase uttered first by Mark Zuckerberg in 1984 and then later tattooed out to a number of Silicon Valley “super power players” to illustrate the power of the early, hyperconnected tech industry.   The story goes that these early, hyperconnected tech giants (e.g. Facebook) often had more to gain from the “day of the fat guy” than the fat itself. But that day ended up being delayed, given how much the business got out of control.  But there was a way to make this “the day of the fat boy,” even in a world where it wasn’t just lunchtime. 
Today, this story is a great opportunity to take a look at Silicon Valley’s most recent attempts to create and nurture a fat-tech industry: the “fat guy” concept, if you were a fat person looking to find the best niche in the world where you could be successful, was still not having a major impact on the tech scene.
Yes, there was great innovation, and an incredible amount of

 little of a shock that something like this exists in the wild.”
“The majority of people I’ve met have been super excited at this app. A common theme is that people are really excited at the ability to share their experiences and they want to know what’s happening in their friends. They want to hear us describe our vision. Our vision is to make privacy awesome again, that’s something people are really excited at. And then, when they share their own experiences they want to be in control in what they share. That’s something we feel very good in ourselves.”"
"There are few things more frustrating than trying to find the food you’re looking for at a busy restaurant. With so many online options now that everyone has a smartphone, and apps that can tell you where you can find the restaurant you’ve been told to wait 20 minutes, it can be hard to keep up.
Until now, TheChic opened a waitlist feature in May 2012 on its website, mobile apps and the web that lets diners browse and search for a specific dish, and then purchase the item through a mobile app. TheChic CEO Kevin Hubert says the feature has been fairly limited, thus far, having only been used to bring back “hundreds” of restaurants, as opposed to thousands. Today, however, TheChic is rolling out its waitlist features to the entire site and Android and iOS apps, for a number of brand new reasons.
First and foremost the new waitlist features use location to encourage users to come to TheChic restaurants they typically visit.
“When you’re visiting a brand new restaurant, you’re not going to wait at each restaurant, but you might be in and of the restaurant when you’re hungry that day and you’re a little hungrier than you should be,” said Hubert. “By providing a unified app experience to all your locations, hopefully that will help you be the very active customer in every one of those locations.”
The new features also tap into the Android ecosystem – in the Android 4.4 update, which hits a little early this summer, the company added its waitlist feature, which will also integrate with notifications from your phone to alert you when it’s time to eat. TheChic’s Android apps are unaffected.

Hubert was also happy to point out that the startup already has over 10 million users in the nine countries it serves. (The company would prefer not be identified as only an Android-focused app at this point, however.) The startup is also growing at a rapid pace, as it currently serves over 30,000 dishes per month."
"When you have your phone on your person and start taking a long drive, it can get kind of ridiculous. You’re barely making it and everyone keeps watching your little brother while driving… but thankfully the folks at Motus Corporation – makers of a software solution for helping drivers stay alert on their phones – have set their sights on bigger goals that may have previously seemed modest — a $100 billion company opportunity.
And it’s actually kind of cool.
The problem here is one of efficiency. With the world’s cars gradually going mobile, with many more devices connected to the web at every turn of the smartphone, safety is a big challenge, one which a number of services have also tried to tackle.
Motus Corp. has been around for more than 50 years and has built a software platform that’s both simple to adopt and, in fact, durable. The company has already developed software solutions for businesses like Toyota and Hyatt; in October, it became part of the largest mobile hardware investment in U.S. history and is a leader in the consumer mobile and software space with a focus on providing drivers with hands-free, location-based services.
The problem is, after all, not just limited to one particular mobile platform but to do so in a way that’s both safe and environmentally friendly. “We’re not making phones safer, we’re making a safer platform for smartphones,” Motus’ CEO, Tim Kubacki, told me earlier this year.
The solution, as Kubacki described it, involves a mixture of physical location data, app location data, social presence data, data-level insights, machine learning, algorithms and more to measure how people are using their devices safely. It includes not just basic smartphone hardware monitoring, but also plug-in traffic analysis, fuel efficiency and GPS location-based services like map driving directions.
But, as TechCrunch’s Darrel Etherington noted after the company’s raise of $30 million, location and navigation are all critical components to a modern smartphone experience. The trick is that not every vehicle can necessarily measure exactly where it is at all times. Some

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 of a $2 million investment from North Bridge in 2009.
While the new company was created at a time when Facebook was in its infancy, and TechCrunch’s Jon Evans was still in the dark ages of the early days, what you can see emerging at the time of the acquisition is the rebirth of Facebook itself.
If anything, this is an interesting turn of events in a company that had, until that point, lagged behind in the mobile social gaming world. Zynga launched its first game, Mafia Wars, on the Apple App Store in 2007, some two years before the ephemeral game hit, which originated in the ephemeral message-sending space, developed by startup AppStore.com, and was initially known as a more casual sim. In the same way that Zynga took the top slot in the iTunes app store in the early days of the mobile era, it has done the same on the desktop and has been positioning itself as the center of social game experiences for years.
“This is unique because Facebook isn’t just about games of share-able memories – it’s about people’s experiences in them – from buying memories,” COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote in a blog post earlier today. “Facebook is about people”.
This is an interesting and forward-thinking move. It’s a bit weird to think that a social media company would want to build a social gaming network, but when Zynga did, they saw the opportunity as a way around the corner of its own app and platform. And that’s what Facebook found a natural fit to do, as Andy Yang wrote in an interview with The Next Web when contacted by TechCrunch."
"Forget artificial intelligence, virtual reality or drones. What truly revolutionizes human-computer interaction online is the fact that the tech involved in online shopping, travel, banking and much more has largely been limited to data processing and fetching and analyzing. 
A San Francisco-based startup called Skyhook has been on a mission to change this, and today it’s launching its first product, “Skyhook Credit.” Like other financial service platforms, the startup enables consumers to access a credit card by entering email address and password and, once authorized, the card can be used to pay other types of retail, including things like food and dining reservations, taxi rides, cable/Internet TV service, student loans, and more. 
The idea behind Skyhook Credit is that online shopping, for example, can be a big shopping spout. That’s where Skyhook Credit comes in. The company is launching a new web application that offers online checkout within moments of their deciding to buy something. The technology, which is called “dynamic pricing,” leverages data to ensure that only the one user who actually makes the purchase actually pays what the seller charged. 
With this approach, you can see how Skyhook can create more value with merchants by offering them an alternative to just charging “normal,” i.e., the fee that the merchant typically charges. For example, a package deal shopper might find that the price for that carrier ticket was 20 percent off, but it would be charged for the same package once that customer opted in to the pricing scheme.
Plus, for the very most part, Skyhook Credit card holders are participating in the dynamic pricing. “We’re seeing that in three months, the prices for things like food and shopping have stabilized as dynamic pricing. People are choosing to use dynamic pricing for their products not because they have a huge markup — they’re paying 20 percent to 25 percent above what they are asking for now,” explains Skyhook co-founder and CEO Michael Reich. The other key with the dynamic pricing, he says, is the fact that there’s no fee for merchants to accept Visa cards or Mastercard payments. 
The other key? “I just think that we understand humans are not social creatures; we’re creatures that like to shop and we like to have things that are convenient. Why not leverage some kind of relationship with an online retailer to get discounts on goods and services,” Reich explains.
This is where the dynamic pricing comes into play. The way the dynamic pricing works, and the way this will work for users is that you link up your financial account with the brand you choose and then you’re presented with instant gratification. If you’re going to spend $60, for example, and you have a card on file with the retailer, they can instantly know that and automatically activate the card (for free, or for $10, if they get a coupon on file) and a charge for the card in the form of a transaction receipt.
Of course, there’s more work. “As a user, what you’ll get when you

 them access to Google Drive, while users can also import their own documents and start working with projects right in the app, without having to download an additional file manager app.
The company says that it plans to release the new ‘Project Explorer‘ feature, which will let users view “Project Annotations” right in the Document window, “and soon,” to view their entire history from Project X to Project X, with notifications coming in over Twitter and Facebook-level as well. This feature was previously spotted by TNW.
Another new feature in Preview and Document is a new ‘Shared View’ option. This is a view that shows what your files and folders may have been shared with others, which you can decide to make public or private. You can now also see who shared them, and then decide to share them only with people who are publicly visible and subscribed to your work as well, with “only” sharing them with a small group.
A browser-style ‘Tabs’ tab lets you further customise the experience, allowing you to showcase your files and folders, and preview other parts of a document, or just make it blank in order to quickly and easily share them elsewhere and in your social media feeds.
Finally, there’s a “Share” feature within the Preview right next to the Files section in the app that will offer a way to send links and files via email, SMS, Flickr, Facebook etc. This isn’t a huge new feature as well – it has been a long time sitting on the other side of Apple’s cloud services, for instance.
With the latest Preview update, however, it looks like the idea here is that you can share the same way you do in Microsoft or even other online file-hosting services, even though you may technically be using different cloud services.
It only works as a Chrome extension, after all.
The update comes on the heels of a desktop update of Adobe Digital Editions that’s also going live this week. While it wasn’t directly mentioned in the comments, Digital Editions is a suite of digital publishing tools for professional and professional photographers, and the company bought by Adobe."

The ongoing war on words between Internet companies that use terms like “Apple” and “Facebook” is playing a central part in our daily lives today. Google’s Android mobile operating system is a good example of the battle for our minds. Microsoft has its Surface tablets and the Lumia series of touch-friendly smartphones. Google’s Android mobile OS, in many ways, is the underdog, and is a product of its past and the last battle over control of smartphone operating systems and markets. But when Google acquired Motorola, we heard Google talk about the “Google OS.”
Google’s OS was built primarily on Google’s Ara, and as a result, is primarily a replacement for Android. Google’s operating system was an early rival in Windows, but for Android companies to remain relevant in consumers’ minds, should their consumer tech become popular, they need to be able to fight out their Android-viking competition, especially Apple which has been able to use iOS as a source for differentiation between Android and iOS (as it has done for several years now). Google’s OS has no shortage of ways to look at Apple’s iPhone, and its competition within Android continues to mount.
Google’s “Android for Work” program provides OEMs with software for the development of their own customized OS for running their OEM software and devices, rather than giving them a simple way to create a Google version that can run on their Android smartphones and tablets, especially in key growth markets, like China and Russia. As Google hardware and OS makers can get the OS from Google for an extra $200 per month, it effectively becomes a new licensing platform that manufacturers can activate. There, competitors can create their own OS-less apps which can be monetized through ads, and Google can charge OEMs.
At first, Google will push manufacturers to buy Android for Work versions of the OS, which will “make their existing Apple software obsolete,” according to an email to a customer sent by Google today. The OEMs can only use software developed by Google on their own brand devices, so that software won’t appear on other products. “In this way, Android for Work is a competitive product like Android for consumers. It simplifies the differentiation between OS and software, thereby allowing OEMs to focus on what most consumers want – performance,” Google’s email says. “At the same time, our partner OEMs support Android for Work as a platform for developing new

, one of its services that you can use without involving a human is how it handles the inevitable questions of automation as a function of the environment. That is, this process is intended to be an aftermarket.
But a lot of companies are taking this approach right now, just as the cost of constantly evolving software has gone out and now runs on a smart computer that’s designed to help the machine learn what it needs in order to operate efficiently. As in the case of “autopilot,” if you don’t go to sleep, the more you stay in the cockpit, the more the better your job will be done.
As a result, we now have to talk about what it means to have the right human at the right moment to make sure the machines aren’t going ahead. The first is actually a relatively straightforward question: “What is the right human behind the wheel?” While the machine does have some automation, it is by no means an all-employable machine. In fact, it needs more human intervention, even if that isn’t in the form of a machine operating software, operating the machine, operating the software, or dealing with humans in more delicate ways.
It’s a lot easier for the system to go out of its comfort zone as it proceeds to work, and as a result, it is often at the same level of sophistication that the system itself requires to accomplish the same tasks.
But that isn’t a solution itself. It takes real human intervention or a strong and committed human operator like me to step it into gear as you may have experienced in a situation of great technical difficulty. So you’ll probably have to at least attempt to step the machine yourself if you want to stay beyond the “autopilot” solution.
A human expert may, for example, decide to step the machine. When an expert steps the machine in a situation described above, the machine’s ability to deal with the conditions and execute in the event itself is greatly reduced, and it may even make a little noise that is very distracting to a high degree. The human mind will then go through the process of reading the data, understanding what it is, and making the decision to step things in.
The human will also sometimes try to make the decision to make the decision in a way that the machine can’t handle. The autoperations of the machine itself are often quite complex and time-consuming. It’s impossible for a machine to make every decision perfectly, and a human can help automate the complexity that can be done as a machine by helping a machine make every decision it has ever made. It’s a bit like a machine that understands it is in its own mode.
At that high level, many of our most complex systems — including those which are built with the highest level of complexity — can sometimes be managed by humans only. The most successful technology has always relied on a superior combination of human brains and automated technology.
But now we’re beginning to face a very, very new world in which autonomous machines may not be quite so intuitive. As it is, the human will not be the driver of all the computer and machine processes, but may play a very active role, assisting those machines, in the ways in which they need and in the ways that they may actually benefit from the data.
The human will be in the driver’s seat, and will be able to steer and direct the machine wherever it needs to go. For example, once the machine encounters a scene that requires some sort of threat or danger, the human will steer to the direction of the object in order to stay safe and avoid it or to avoid it. If the machine encounters another object, if there are “tens of thousands of kilometers of unexplored terrain”, the human will then determine “yes or no” to the scene based on the results.
In this world, that driverless driverless car, as it may sound, would take away the human from the task of the human, as described: “The human is no longer a role-model or a role-model of the machine, I am in control, giving him or her the right of free and easy access, while the driverless apparatus would be made largely redundant to a secondary role that I am largely trying to take over by providing access. We may, in fact, work somewhat like the human will; we can still make a distinction between us-as-engineers and our machines, but I don’t think it’s so hard to understand how such a sophisticated automated machine would have been done so way earlier on, let alone in any way.”

The next most important question we should ask is what happens to the driverless apparatus

 replacement in these markets.”
“We are extremely bullish on mobile and see strong growth in the coming times,” he said. “Consumers in Poland, Russia and other CIS countries are all growing at a strong pace. In the last three months we had more than 70% year over year and in the last two years we passed 200 million devices [transferred] between our devices.” This will probably happen in the next quarters. (Indeed, with the iPhone launch looming the end of this year, there will be a lot of opportunity to pick up more iPhone users in the next month or so.)
He added that while it currently makes money through selling advertising in the feed — and users getting a small payment to drive up Page views — Krawd is not focused on monetizing completely yet. (I’m asking). So you either look at new ways to make more money outside of the feed, like ads in the app, or you look at ways to monetize to drive more users to the app in future while the core product and brand remains largely unchanged. As others have pointed out, a lot of the advertising dollars that get gobbled up in the US by mobile ad giants (both Google and Facebook in their various permutations) have been funneled to other companies by the likes of Yahoo and Bing.
“We are still focusing first on getting to 200 million active users (we’re at about 150 million now),” he said. “We have an ambitious goal in mind that is to get to 400 million users in the next one year.” As with Facebook, the company is also exploring ideas about how to monetize not just in this area, but elsewhere. It has experimented with a few different variants of how ads could appear in the feed, including things like interstitial and native. As with Facebook specifically, the idea was how users could earn credits or levels, with some of the more popular ones giving you the first free and first paid edition access to a downloadable full version of the game if you wanted it. Like Facebook, the idea here is two-fold — both how Krawd is hoping to drive more sales in these users, and the way that advertisers for these users are paying to reach their games (and potentially other players like Krawd to reach users who might not have paid in the past). Krawd is monetizing in a different way entirely, in that it looks at how users scroll through games, in order to create some in-app content for users to download and engage with as well as buy virtual goods in the games themselves.
The company is taking an early lead here in the gaming segment. It says it has more than 10 million users overall across mobile and desktop internet/console consoles, with a particularly strong following among gamers in Poland. It plans to use the funding to grow that audience further as it closes in on 500 million users for iOS devices and takes Krawd into the mobile games segment. It’s also raising its game catalog to five million titles on iOS before the end of the year, to give it room for more big game launches, a big push into mobile, and international expansion."
"Meet Zula, a French startup that has been flying somewhat under the radar. Launching today, Zula is the first startup with a business model in place. Zula doesn’t seem to have a firm business model yet, but rather has been flying under the radar. But don’t be fooled by this one — Zula is a business that’s already working in a very specific niche, and already has a strong market share.
As is typical for French startups, Zula is taking a very different tack, opting for a straight-up product, and to a lesser known niche. But this doesn’t mean that the company is not already doing quite well, though: It’s already crossed one million users in the seven countries where it’s active — France, Germany, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Canada, the U.K., Italy and New Zealand. In France, Zula has 10,000 users.
There are already 1.000 teams signed up for the service, and there are also 1 million active users in Europe. According to the company, it will take a minimum of 7 weeks for new teams to come on board. Once these new members become established, Zula is now going to start raising between $25,000 and $50,000 a year.
So how is it going to monetize? While Zula is not making any money yet, the company is quite bullish on three key revenue streams — its teams, its technology, and the U.K. It plans to launch in four to five new markets per quarter in the U.K., U.K., Germany, Italy and France. Right now, Zula’s U.S. offices are mostly serving as the middleman in these new markets, as well

 said that many of the people who signed up to be a part of the test pool will be returning to the U.S. States and other regions, and that they will continue to receive benefits and discounts.

“While there are a lot of benefits in expanding your brand overseas, for us, I think there are two main things that really matter,” he said. “We want to grow the world and meet the demand of our foreign consumers.”
In the U.S., other places see consumers not only increasingly coming online through mobile devices – in fact, some 46% of all internet traffic in the U.S., or 7,100 billion ad impressions annually, comes from mobile devices or tablets, according to data from Nielsen.
India’s smartphone market, meanwhile, is growing fast, and is expected to surpass $7 billion in spending this year by a wide margin, and it’s expected that by the end of 2012, Indian smartphone sales will exceed those of low-cost Android devices, and high-quality flash memory cards will become more attractive as well,"
"Apple has received a patent from the Korea Intellectual Property Lab that describes a third mobile screen for the next version of the iPhone in 2014, which might be referred to as the “iPad Air”. The screen would sport a bezel similar to the one used on the new iPad and iPod Touch, but which would be tucked away behind the new iPad’s more substantial back cover, according to Apple’s filing. Unlike the Air, the next iPhone may be simply a bezel with the new iPad’s cover, as was the case with the last iPhone hardware.
This type of screen may be a new patent altogether, but it makes sense to consider it as a potential tech trick on a company’s side to help it stand out from the crowd, especially since it could potentially be useful for different purposes, including both display and interaction modes. Display has become an increasingly important part of mobile, and for good reasons: screen time, interaction options, content and content options. Being able to view video without a side-by-side view is especially important, since video confuses a user’s and creates a false feeling, as is putting icons and content where they shouldn’t.
A screen like this may be one that Apple displays as a part of a larger rollout plan, which would coincide with Mac and iOS 7 in October, to coincide with the iPhone’s fall. There’s also a possibility that Apple will opt for similar displays on top of existing displays, in order to better take advantage of the improved capabilities of the newer processors, and possibly for better resolution.
Apple has to be very careful here, however, since building a bezel means it has to compromise on one side of the device, and potentially another on the other, since a traditional, flat look could result in both visual and aural breakdown of what a device actually is. That could cause some apprehension among consumers, but Apple is doing it anyway, even giving it a space to run ads for the new iPad below, which is likely to alleviate any that might have been inevitable.
So far, we’ve heard a few about how Apple is contemplating the bezel becoming more of a secondary display that is accessible by turning it on like a tablet or the Retina MacBook, which isn’t as likely. As for the bezel-less screen, it might be something that would make a lot of sense, too, especially given how it wouldn’t sit anywhere near the bottom of a device like the existing one, according to any current Apple rumors. In fact, rumors have even been taking hold, with Scoble saying that Apple has been working on a 12.9-inch iPad Air 2, and a new report emerging claiming a new iPad could launch next year, so even if we don’t get closer to a launch window that would probably meet our expectations."
"Apple has a new patent titled “Electronic device interactions for wearable devices,” which describes a way that iPhone owners could do things like unlock devices remotely or change the passcode on the device, add contacts, view the status of messages read directly on their Apple Watch and remote control of connected accessories. The patent is credited also to Cherubic Electronics, which makes low-power Bluetooth technology used in wearable gadgets like the smartwatch Pebble and smart bike.
The patent is from Apple’s Intellectual Property Lab, which describes a system that displays a list of Bluetooth-enabled devices on a device’s companion app. It uses a series of small LED sensors to provide information about the device on iOS’s accessory “Home Screen,” which isn’t accessible without closing or customizing Safari mode, for instance, and which operates in a “software-defined storage device” within the secure enclave that Apple usually uses to place software on its

 but the idea was to find an easier way to do that. The price doesn’t reflect the effort involved.
We saw a lot of the elements of the algorithm:
They had created a machine called a Pavlok — it was meant to reward users who didn’t like it enough to review the product.
We built and tested the system and found out that a user who liked a product could actually receive a Pavlok — they just had to give a negative feedback. We found the user-base was a bit lower than our ideal target, some 3M total.”
“I was a little concerned,” he says. “There’s a big misconception here. How many users do you have, and how much use do you have for that user? And when you do use them it’s a very clear cut in how valuable this product is. I did notice that it was very spammy,” he told us. “I had lots of people tweeting around trying the offer and asking for it.”
When asked about Facebook Page reach, he admits that with only 10,000 people on the Page, Facebook had very little success. But, he adds, “I think we should have been more aggressive [than our goal]. And certainly we should have spent more money.”
The team later put the app together with help from one of the people who had worked on it—an NYU computer science lecturer named Geoffrey Hinton, who had also come up with the idea of crowd-sourcing, Hinton’s own invention of a computer designed to solve problems at scale for an enormous community of users.

“He designed the basic algorithms…and some of them came up…I think you can imagine it was one thing that surprised him,” says Wendy. “We would just kind of be amazed, that we’re sitting at this thing… It’s a huge problem that he’s solving, so it was our challenge to design it from the start,” he says.
The initial experiment was to run some of the initial tests and put the service out into the wild. During this summer, the service, which only started a few weeks ago, still is in its very early stages. As it goes to launch, the service promises to deliver a wide range of personalized recommendations across 16 categories, ranging from fashion, entertainment to food, travel, style, books, music, DIY, home goods, and much more. The company today will curate the content created for you and provide you with personalized recommendations in around one week.
The service will launch with a handful of categories including “living” (i.e., health and fitness), “fitness” (which includes home goods like chairs and other related equipment) and “beauty and personalization,” a product that is not yet available.

Wendy, who is a single founder who arrived from L.A., has found a welcoming home among those working in his industry – not just in terms of business, but also when it comes to embracing new ideas and learning from other founders he’s managed to build a relationship with the whole."
"Facebook says it’s the world’s largest photo-sharing site, and yet photos sent to it are still discarded across the social network rather than Facebook. It has launched a private messaging option for photos tagged ‘Made By Facebook’. 
The feature, that’s actually not yet available to everyone, is a direct response to Facebook’s recent decision to turn each of its million+ photos into interactive ads – those small clips of friends and family that include places, places, stickers, and videos that could be embedded elsewhere.
This makes sense considering Facebook has never really been about photos with a larger focus on the broader message. Instead, the company would sell the collection of photos that users tagged ‘Made By Facebook’ to marketers as a form of interactive advertising alongside the massive photoset that is Facebook’s plan to sell search keywords and other ad inventory through its site.
Facebook’s been getting heat in recent months from people wanting to remove their posts from search results in favor of newer, organic search results and the general decline of search results as the site begins to lose the quality of Google’s results on that front.
That hasn’t been helped by Facebook’s own search engine improving – and its algorithms improving – in response to what are perceived issues around search engines and relevance.
In February 2014 the company launched the idea of Open Graph, which is an alternative to the simple-but-difficult concept of private sharing, which lets your published photos ‘appear’ to higher up in the Ticker, newsfeed, or search results page thanks to the use of Facebook�

 profiles to a few different places, which is a good sign for users.

So what makes the Android tablet stand out from the iPad app? There’s no major change here aside from having Android-branded content in the mix for YouTube videos. The PC-based video player could make YouTube look like an iPad app. Plus, the app has Google’s Play Store and search, which means there’s less friction for users and the ecosystem to run on. You can watch videos on Android tablet or iPhone.
Another cool trick is Google’s ‘Peek’ method, which lets you swipe across content to get a close watch on something. This adds an extra click to the right, which is something not available in the iPad app.
The YouTube iPad app seems fairly basic too, with a video database, one of the less impressive looking features, like YouTube Tags. However, it’s well designed and easy to use. You swipe right to view more videos, swipe left to ignore a video, and swipe right to click into the video (or start a new one).
So why do some Android tablet-like apps want to bring more native iPad engagement to Facebook? It appears that users are very interested in that feature, according to the Facebook analytics service Feedly. After downloading the Feedly app, Facebook is asking users to “Rate” the video they’re watching by opening the video in a web browser, according to their Facebook blog post.
Here’s the list of supported feeds:
Update: So what do Instagram and Google Drive get out of this?
Update 2: Facebook tells me that its partners include Viddy, The Young Turks, and Viddy Co. The company also told Forbes that the iPad app is live in 11 countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, the Middle East, and Brazil.
The company also told me that it currently sees “a very high percentage” of monthly video viewing.
More recently, Facebook launched a new app called Facebook Lite, which is meant to be a slicker version of Facebook, with features such as pre-loaded or un-crowded content, a Timeline, and focus on a user’s own home page.

"Editor’s note: Jeff Ma is a co-founder of Tenaya, an awesome blog that offers some practical advice to startup founders on what product they should concentrate on.  
The following advice is to focus on three metrics: money, time and money, and to put them out in a bold way. (This is the post-Angel Twitter, not the post-Private Twitter.) The three-point check factor is derived from the definition of “financially prepared” when it comes to your product, and it’s based on your cash-burn strategy. This one is less about managing your burn, and more about setting your target.
Money
In the Bay Area, there are different ways to spend your money. There are many different sources of funding in the Bay Area (public funding and non-accumulation equity financing) that often comes together and is thought of as a “fund.” It’s not uncommon to have a number of sources to choose from, including venture debt, AngelList syndicates, private equity, etc.
Money isn’t everything, but if you’re an investor with an “invest” that you’re actually burning, you might make sense to put cash into your startups.
Time
What time do you “need” to get your product into the market? Ideally, you want to start shipping and having users in a beta or early adopter program. What is the best use of that time?
Time is obviously more than the product. As we know, in a startup, it’s all about scaling. It’s not about a week after launch, it’s about fixing the foundation to scale effectively.
Time is also important when you have to allocate a budget to invest in your product, and for us that’s time-to-time. When we set up our seed fund, that’s a critical factor for understanding how much time people really need after initial development. That is, after the first year, a lot of money is necessary. It also takes time to get users to a place where they’re happy with the product.
Time-to-Time
As we talk about time, it’s important to remember that money is important. It can be important for some people, and often it can be even more important for others.

 end with this.
That leaves the gap between the app maker and the end user.
I’d argue this is something both app stores are failing to mature enough to accommodate the multiple newspending opportunities that are rapidly shaping up in apps. When you consider how table stakes like the App Store and the App Store vary in their functionality, it’s pretty tough to tell where the experiences start and end. As I wrote earlier this month,
However, the App Store is already littered with a thousand apps, and that number is expected to grow. There are hundreds of apps available today. That doesn’t bode well for making it easy for anyone to find and try new apps.
If you’re a fan of the idea of the “good enough” App Store (the concept applies) there are some good tools available for free on iTunes, such as App Store Optimizer and a dedicated app search engine. However, most of these tools are geared toward developers, and not the end users.
There are some good ways to discover apps. For example, if you look at Amazon or Google, you might find that there are a slew of good options out there, including ones built specifically to help you discover new apps and apps for a particular category. However, when you are looking at iTunes and the App Store, there aren’t that many options.
Good luck pulling out your wallet.
"
"Google wants to help you discover nearby apps users have previously synced with Google, and it has launched a new search feature in iOS 7 that pulls in related content. The search feature lets you pull up the app drawer from a search to pull up app links shared with friends, and it can also be used to brow through related apps by keyword or keyword in other apps.
It’s unclear how Apple will respond to this move, which would open the door to other app discovery services like discovery from mobile manufacturers that have previously been less prolific. The iOS Search button, which launched last July, does appear to be one of the first things Apple has made available. But the question is whether it’s enough to help Google.
Other recent moves for Google include adding more metadata to Gmail, including the location of the app to get that aggregation of your emails. The latest update for Google Maps from the App Store now offers a link to its full catalog of apps, though Apple hasn’t said what it will be providing it. The Google Maps app in recent months has also been slow at getting updated regularly, and as we’ve learned, it can take some time before it gets a major overhaul and actually shows its face.
Google doesn’t want to be just another app discovery service, so these efforts are clearly about adding new app services to help it accomplish its mission of building a platform that ties together Android, iOS and Google apps. It’s also about building a network that builds apps for consumers. The app ecosystem, Google told me, is the key to doing that and its push to become the go-to platform for apps."
"With just a few clicks, the new Facebook Groups feature lets you discover groups to create an active, always-updated social network at Facebook for your members. It also works across platforms, so you can find Groups just by adding a new one to Facebook or with your Facebook friends and those of your friends who use it. The idea is to create a social network where all of your Facebook contacts are always connected back, but you can share individual news and ideas with anyone with no need to download new apps.
The feature’s design is pretty attractive at first glance; it features a light blue bar at the top which has to be revealed gradually to users to tap into the social network.
With a Facebook Groups tool, members don’t have to start an invite process. But if you don’t have a good story to tell, the app’s feed will display new groups daily. So far, it has been somewhat accurate, and it’s likely to get better over time.
The feature is the product of the Facebook Groups product, which lets groups of members create groups to share specific content and advice with their friends, and you can still maintain an active group by subscribing to or joining individual posts. The new feature will not only let you discover new groups, it also have the same personalization mechanisms, giving users the ability to customize Group members based on who they’re connected to and who they’re friends of friends and by allowing users to share the information when they want it.
A single new “Edit Groups” button on the Groups app lets members see all of their Groups within a one-tap fashion. The service can also be un-bundled, and you can add/remove individual

 New startups with a big idea to change the world, we’ve set out to do it by creating a set of products that empower women to create successful businesses and societies, and help more women become entrepreneurs.” 
As a female who began to notice the changes happening in the world around us, I’m especially excited about the platform and how it will make an impact not only in our economy but our society. 
To help make this vision a reality, we are raising money (and not just money) from investors. 
So, as we go about the World Cup, we are going to continue raising money to help support the programs and programs that need to be done. Whether it’s the girls, athletes, and entrepreneurs who are showing us that there are no barriers, barriers that hold back, obstacles that no one should be able to get through, hurdles that we should be able to overcome, hurdles that no one should be able to get through, etc., we need to spread our voice as a society and a community."
"There’s a lot of stuff on Steve Huffman’s mind right now, which is why it’s interesting that he’s just launched a new business-to-business travel company called Allegiant Air, which will allow travel sites to integrate Uber for the purpose of promoting their content.
It seems like Uber can be a bit of a chicken and egg situation for other companies: As with any company with a lot of established content, they can’t fully rely on it or rely on the tech alone, leaving a sizable chunk of revenue for a third-party to provide the critical services that are necessary to power that content.
A number of startups have tried to crack this problem — for example, TripAdvisor, which later sold to ITA Software (now owned by a publicly-traded company called TrippInsights), has turned to the big-time media companies to help advertise on their travel pages. (Adserve is the one to beat at this market.)
The problem, of course, is that in order for our travel sites, they’d have to handle all the annoying technology to get a good result for their content. A lot of them are focused on providing a back-end solution to a specific problem, and making sure the user experience is pretty good, but they may just have a ton of issues with how well their pages are designed.
In other words, it might not be worth it for him — and Uber — to focus on this new product and possibly rely on the public resources of a company like TripAdvisor.
The plan, Huffman said, is to launch the service over time, with the first partner partner being TripAdvisor. The plan is to be live in a few cities over the next month like San Francisco and Seattle, as well as in a number of other U.S. cities."
"With the buzz and rush to catch the wave following the Facebook acquisition of Oculus VR, and the hype around drone-related and virtual reality startups also following a rush, it’s interesting to see the market for motion-activated devices and their creators, especially outside of the gaming space. Now, a new VR startup called Zenly is aiming to shake things up by offering something that’s both cheaper and more accessible (and potentially more enjoyable) than full-fledged motion-sensing gadgets.
There’s a reason that Zenly is so focused on content creation: there’s a lot of content that’s currently out there and has yet to become a really great gaming experience, and Zenly seeks to make the content creation part of its company more accessible and accessible to a broader audience. The problem for Zenly, as it’s also already based on a freemium model, is offering something that’s both really fun or challenging to play with, but that also has a lot of depth to it. In other words, Zenly will be aiming to build a platform that’s just for the core gamers; it will offer things like leaderboards, an esports-like leader-board, virtual tournaments, an arcade mode, and more.
That’s the same basic philosophy behind motion-sensing products, of course, but with the goal of making the games on Zenly fully immersive. The company is already working with Intel and Qualcomm on its software, including their new version of Project Vivado, which uses a video camera and combined those with its cloud services to turn a 360-degree video into a tournament-play experience that’s much more social and immersive.
That platform will be available for $2.99 per month, and there are still a lot of challenges as Zenly continues to make the experience it offers fully responsive, that includes technical challenges like figuring if all that motion is actually the next to the player’s screen and if all that motion is actually just

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 commitments, both at Facebook and a high level at the company:
I’ve asked Facebook about what it wants to get for selling off its stake in the firm in the future, and if it wants to continue buying more of his business.
Update: Here it is. “We don’t have anything specific to announce,” Facebook tells me. “Google’s interest in Facebook starts out as a curiosity, but we’re going to focus here on making it the best possible Facebook.” After all, Google does too work on its own Internet.org project — one case of why it might still be very interested, and, as we noted before, could prove that much more can come from the bigger companies.

But there are still some questions: Should Facebook, which is not as well-known as Google or Apple, continue to hold a seat on the board? Facebook, we understand, has some very strong ties to Google — specifically to be able to manage payments and keep an almost ubiquitous user base with its service. Facebook could still make acquisitions or scale its business independently from Google. (Or the world’s financial crisis.)
In any case, the company has been doing very well monetizing the services — some three-quarters of the company’s 1.5 billion active users, it says — and that has given the company enough cash to continue to grow. Facebook’s Q3 results will be the biggest cash dividend ever issued in stock, with stock dividends only kicking at $0.09.
So, while it was easy for other analysts to point to the company’s high stock price on the news of its earnings, and, indeed, a pretty big fall on this market after high hopes, it was almost incomprehensible what Facebook was doing with its share price at the end of the share’s run up after earnings were published.
Part of it had to do with Facebook’s size with outside capital:

This is where we got that great Facebook earnings leak: the company said that revenue from third-party apps — and therefore on mobile — had triple-digit percentages of its overall revenues for the first time ever. It claimed that it was responsible for the growing revenue from Apps revenue to (the end of 2015) nearly 2-thirds of its overall total revenue — meaning the company was responsible.
Facebook said that it expected this to increase over time as it continues to expand the business on its platform across platforms internationally.
And it had the data to corroborate that. On October 26 last year, Facebook said that Messenger — the mobile messaging service that it bought for a staggering price of $19 billion last year — now has 100 million monthly active users, and in September it said that Messenger is “on track to pass 90% of ad revenue on to Facebook or equivalent services like Google” by 2018. More than a year after its acquisition of WhatsApp, that’s been pretty aggressive for Facebook."
"If you’re a parent who wants to get your kids excited about virtual things, that’s where Canvas Toys comes in. It’s a newly launched iPhone app that aims to be kid-friendly yet allows children to control their on-screen devices without a huge investment in an “educational app”. Instead, the app is meant to be a playground for exploring, as well as a social network for family members and friends.
The app allows users to play with a little wooden horse, teleport a bunny, or a ball to their iPad while on vacation. The idea is that it can help the children develop fine motor skills, creative skills and social skills. However, it may be the apps that really work here.
The first three features include: a search function, a family chat room, and a racing game in your mobile phone. The company has come a long way, and seems to be on its path to becoming the real game-to-play in the children’s mobile app space.
The search function is perhaps most appealing. Parents can search by name for the best search engine. Once the search term has been found, you can search for a specific phrase using the Canvas, just like you would on the web. You can search by keyword or search by name or topic keyword, similar searches.

The app also allows a deeper search function that allows you to search by location and category (e.g. I want to know “friends with dogs that love cats” or that my kid likes to bike.). These features make the app into much more of an educational experience, not just a game. But I don’t need to report that for a mobile phone app to be effective for children.

The Canvas is also the first mobile app to adopt a Facebook “Like” button. The new social network allows users to see the friends who’ve liked each post. This is how the

you are probably not interested in an “Ask Me Anything”-style video or Pinterest of the coolest cat pics, you’re more likely to see the company’s own content. This is, by and large, why Google’s own interest in VR, Glass and potentially even Google-launched VR Experiments is good news, but the company also wants big data to power it. 
The VR room will probably have an element of surprise (the company is cagey on everything but content), but everyone will know that by using virtual reality (and virtual reality) it becomes an immersive experience. It could also be hugely commercial, as users shift away from the nauseous feeling of watching generic static image-based video ads in the same room as your friends and loved ones. It’s all very exciting, but you might not know it just because it’s all happening out there in the wilds of the virtual world.
The VR room will be available in the fall, and Google also says it doesn’t want to rush things to the release date. Instead, the company has planned out the experience further and releases it later in 2017."
"If people are interested in trying out Google’s latest suite of web search products, it’s probably because you were in the market to buy a new phone. Google has just announced the official debut of Project Fi, the company’s own next-generation smartphone search service.
When you have a good old cell phone, remember that Google once made a promise once to never turn a feature phone into a smartwatch. And once we all had Wifi in our pockets for a while, we’d eventually get there, but not any sooner. With the Fi (before it was known as “Project Ara,” before it was known as “Nu” and then “Fu”) as we’re now, Google aims to let you stay up to date with your phone no matter where you are, or with what device you’re on in your pocket.
The company hasn’t quite gotten that far yet, as it seems to be stuck on an odd note that it has made with “home improvements” and “mobile comfort.” But we might just be closer to that already, given the fact that Wi-Fi is now included in the latest lineup.
In a separate announcement on Google+ — promoted by the news release’s editor Ben Thompson, who leads the design of the new pages and user experience — the search giant is also making a few tweaks to its original product.
To better understand how the updates work, you can check out our post and video embedded below.
I’ll be on a trip to Toronto this week for TC next week, so we might hang out in your sweet spot if we’re sitting around an after-party.

"Smart TVs are an appliance most deserving of the right amount of attention given the right resources at their appropriate price. Of course, being smart is easier said than done. There’s a lot of complexity involved, and the standard itself is still often pretty clunky for bettering in-home functionality.
For starters, the basic features available for Smart TVs are pretty clunky by comparison. They include a built-in remote that doubles as a media device, screen that often doesn’t take the form of a fully functional remote, and a fairly large number of functional buttons that require you to spend a lot of time fiddling with, unless you need to use your voice to command the TV.
Another big plus is how easy it is to use a regular, relatively capable smartphone to do things like play music from the remote. Most of the apps that are available for the smart TV, after all, require you to download one of the apps that are pre-loaded, meaning that the actual user experience is a step above.
Plus, even getting to grips with the UI requires that you have some pretty specific training for Android, a desktop-level experience, and some kind of time commitment to do something else. I just happen to be at my parents’ house, and that’s really no excuse for the time investment.
If you’re looking for some tech to help you turn the TV on, my colleague Michael has taken the time to test out the Smart TV Experience for his own home. The experience seems fairly basic in the initial stages, but it becomes more challenging when you get to the part of the Smart TV software, setting up the router for the internet connection (and presumably, setting up a Wi-Fi router), which is easy to talk to thanks to my involvement in that process. (WiFi, of course, is also now part and parcel of pretty much any house.)
After the initial setup process, the Smart TV Experience doesn’t require you to go through the

, the company says that it will add more features to the messaging platform over time. It also allows users to communicate with friends on their mobile device,” the company notes.
That is, for now, WhatsApp is using Apple’s default iMessage functionality by default on its iOS and Android apps, even if there are alternative messaging apps that are built around the needs of iOS users. As a result, WhatsApp users on Android phones can only access the app through iMessage.
To add more features, the company says that it will “be adding emoticons, stickers, a “hashtag launcher”, a “trusted network” that ties into the WhatsApp messaging platform environment and more.
It’s also applying an “Unified Messenger” to Android, as well as the iPhone.
The new, bigger messaging app will also introduce a group chat feature, where users can chat with a single friend or multiple friends, group chat, and it will introduce a “re-sharing” option.
The company is also developing additional options for users who don’t want to use group chat. If you don’t want to chat with a friend, or if you don’t want to share your current messages, you can block them. On Android, this feature has only been turned up to test in April. “We still have a lot of work to do to make the Facebook Messenger experience even better than WhatsApp messaging,” it notes.
On iOS, WhatsApp has now added a full-screen overview of the recently added messages to its platform, which includes a full view onto the entire chat window, and a line up of previews made available to you.
A “Groups” option will let you quickly connect with groups of WhatsApp users in some place, including when you are messaging them or they are talking to someone new. The messaging previews can also be turned into contacts you can chat with or share with, such as when you were chatting with them while chatting with a group of friends.
WhatsApp is also adding a new “Inbox” where users and friends can store messages they want to share publicly. “You can have a conversation in your new inbox when you have a friend on WhatsApp’s phone,” it writes. And you can even create a virtual mailbox where you can store your “best” chats, “favorite contacts,” and other messages.

“In my last year, I received very few shared messages,” it says, noting that it has added “new messaging options to many” in this update to improve this.
That’s also a bid to assuage some of the frustration that users have been faced with of WhatsApp. As a point of comparison, last year’s WhatsApp had 36 million monthly active users, and WhatsApp itself had 2.7 billion monthly active users — although some of the company’s metrics may have been more recent (and in some cases more social-focused) than those of WhatsApp at that point.
In this context, it’s unsurprising that much of WhatsApp’s growth is coming not from a mobile-first, mobile-service, business, but from a broader social sharing angle, with Facebook Messenger, Twitter, and many others a deep link to that world. Now it’s aiming to continue, expanding the types of services and platforms that it can offer users — while at the same time keeping WhatsApp strong behind it.
This looks like it will be a tough play by WhatsApp to keep users engaged, but then again if the core app keeps scoring up to its potential as a place to share, create and and send things that people use regularly — and there’s no doubt it will get significant numbers of users very interested — then that’s a strategy that the company might well be winning, and it could have something to fear when it’s launched to the public in 2015.
What’s interesting about this story is that many of these new features and enhancements may have something to do with WhatsApp’s overall business model.
As it turns out, WhatsApp is still a company that’s figuring out what its identity can do best — in that case, it has been honing down how to position its service for profit. On one hand, it’s hoping that the whole user-base will be more comfortable with its name and its brand, without having to go through the hassle of ‘friends verification’ via existing social-streaming apps (Yobongo being one example) or having to use online identities as a way of verifying they know their friends

 single people. For a company like Pinterest, that’s a huge advantage. With Facebook Groups, a social network as a storehouse and a platform, you can bet the world is on Pinterest at some point this very moment.
Pinterest is one of these social sites, to this point, that seems not to realize its platform has its own user base and its value as a tool for aggregating the world’s information. That, combined with the fact that the service seems to be struggling a bit to differentiate itself from other platforms as it moves more aggressively into user experience, has only led to one thing. It’s not a pretty picture, which is exactly what we’ve been hearing from reports, but we’ll wait and see if it sticks.
It is going to take a while for Pinterest to get its site to the point that it has the potential to become a true business. For now, it’s a service that people will be happy to pay to use. However, we’re also starting to see how it’s becoming a real business.

"The New York Stock Exchange isn’t your typical startup. For four years it had hundreds of employees and few investors. But it’s adapting to how it’s doing business with a new set of products — and just that: a free app for iPhone and iPad, with a plan for earlier Android services.
SlideShare, a new product from a startup called SlideShare, creates presentations from your iOS device, but unlike many other services it will eventually be open to the wider web, with the ability to upload other assets like presentations and videos from your computer. You can read more here about the SlidesShare app.
SlideShare is based on some of the storytelling that Slideshare’s creators have developed over the past year, including themes like the new-look Slideshare app and the company name SlideApp, which seems to be a riffing of Apple’s popular dictation app, Slide. You can try it out here: Slideshare app, not Slideshare app.
We first covered Slideshare back in March 2013, after the company had raised around $500,000 on AngelPad. At the time, Slideshare described itself as offering a “full stack” approach for creating presentation interfaces.
Now Slideshare is taking a page from SlideShare’s book — it’s just starting as a paid product, at present. CEO Brett Slatkin — the company’s CEO and founder who is also founder and CEO of New York-based startup Tagged — gave me a lot more about why he chose Slideshare as the name for the product.
SlideShare is different in a couple of ways.
For one, Slideshare comes from the idea of creating “real-world” presentations. Slideshare allows you to create presentation folders on a live document like Gmail. You create more than one folder, but not one as much. For example, if you’d created a document for the stock market, you could share it through Slideshare, but those would have to exist independently. Slideshare puts the folder structure together. And you can drag and drop presentations to create different types of “live” folders. For now, Slideshare is compatible with iOS, Android and Windows. It should work with any document type, Slideshare’s creator says.

It’s also different in that it focuses on creating a shared document for the social networking services that Slideshare can work with. Slideshare makes it easy for you to create those slideshows from a feed, and then share them through Slideshare, Facebook or Twitter. (It only works with Twitter, I’m told.) Slideshare can also sync your slideshows to a social service like Facebook.
Slideshare can be a major hit with the social networking sites that Slideshare needs to be a partner. CEO Slideshare is not going to use the service itself to share. Instead, the company will create the content for you in the service. Slideshare is a “free blog for social media and you can publish and embed it on your website, with the ability to share to a blog, Facebook a message to followers on Twitter and in email that all these social networks are now sharing,” Slideshare CEO Jason Citron told TechCrunch in 2013.
The company also makes it easy for users to read the presentations, or use Slideshare to create slideshows that they can share, offline. Slideshare will even handle the copyrighting of the content.

The Slideshare app is also available on iOS and Windows Phone (there is a Android app in the works). As Citron

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 past June, in its largest country and largest town in São Paulo. More than 1 million handsets were sold in the first three months of this year.
The lion’s size has been estimated at about 100 meters (or around 10 meters) long.
“You want a lion?” joked the WSJ. “Or you want a tiger,” was the comment that was picked as the topic of conversation when the news broke.

After the post, Twitter’s VP Matt Cohler clarified that the lion was a tiger that was about the size of a grizzly tiger, albeit one of the larger in Asia. But the lion, as stated in the WSJ’s original report, wasn’t necessarily cut from a larger tiger, nor was it a tiger with a long tail.
The original report also noted that the lion had a tail that was longer than a tiger. The post implied that the two of them were in some way related, and the tweet suggested this was the connection.
This wasn’t the first time that a reporter thought the lion was big enough to eat a tiger. In fact, a reporter with the WSJ is currently eating a tiger in Soga.

The original report said that the lions would not only be a great addition to a tiger’s reserve, but the new report confirms that this is the same cat that had belonged to the tiger during the earlier phase of the study and is even the mating season. This time, there is no tail involved and tigers get to go wild.
“This is a male, not a tiger,” the WSJ’s editor said.
This specific study comes at a time when tech has emerged as the primary weapon to be used to eradicate wildlife poaching. In August 2013, tech firm Ricohive Media announced that it had signed a deal with the International Wildlife Research Society to help monitor over 30,000 square miles of sanctities in China.
Tech firm JDi Shenzhen announced five years of operational cooperation with the WWF in November 2013 and, just last week, a joint venture announced that the two will jointly establish a new center for monitoring tiger populations in China.

Tiger Conservation International has published its own blog post post describing the agreement, explaining that it has set up “a new system that will effectively ban poaching as well as allow legitimate conservation of tiger reserves and bring greater attention to the environment.”
Here’s the full exchange:"
"We’re starting to know what the next version of iOS and OS X will look like, so here’s the latest news about OS X El Capitan. Like its OS versions, this update will ship with a stable build of Google’s mobile platform, but with new user interface tweaks.
As a reminder, if you installed iOS 6 or iOS 8 already, chances are that you already have at least some of the iOS 9 bug fixes. With this update, the compatibility environment will be optimized to be updated to iOS 9, the company say.
You can download El Capitan from here. While you’re browsing the Mac App Store, use the search bar up to get to the latest updates."
"This week, Apple introduced a new feature for private photo sharing in iMessage called Camera Roll. It lets you take photos in the style of professional creations, and the idea is to let you share those images with people who are more interested in that subject than others.
I’m not a big fan of the way things have gone with iOS cameras. I have seen a few attempts at interesting applications to help you create photo collages that were far less than perfect (like this iPad photo-focused app), and I thought the iPhone’s new feature (which is called Camera+) was a good opportunity to try to solve this problem.
Unfortunately, I don’t enjoy the photo-taking process so much that I’m less likely to use it regularly, given the kind of lackluster photos I end up taking with my iPhone. That’s because, according to my tests with other iOS camera apps on the market, there’s very little I’d like to specifically do with photos using the new private Camera Roll feature. In the moment, when I open iMessage, the keyboard, compose box and all the buttons are hidden — it’s as if iMessage hasn’t even finished putting the pieces together. With a new private “press,” and only with your name and phone number to authorize, I’m almost out of luck.
I’m not crazy about the new app, to be honest. It’s nice to get to the

SF” product, and it will also be adding a “next steps” section — like those where customers can book with existing customers — so it’s starting to get into a business model lookalike. The company’s early customers will then have instructions for how to activate the product, including a website and mobile apps, it said, since they will also be able to use the product across multiple devices.
For now, the aim is to build up an enterprise user base that intends to use Rangoolvoi as much as possible, and also to push out the product more broadly into the consumer and enterprise markets. Rangoolvoi’s original hardware is intended for a price-conscious and technology premium user with “thousands of devices” in the pipeline, it added.
That price-conscious user is likely going to be led to a range of products, from smart TVs to more sophisticated wearables.
Rangoolvoi has also announced it is starting to open a San Francisco-based company office — which opens in October — and will be led by CEO Zivin Zehnder. In a conference call yesterday, Zehnder offloaded Rangoolvoi as a way to expand the company by adding an in-house SVP for U.S. operations and the CEO of its SVP for Europe.
Another key part of the news is the appointment of a new CFO, Liron Güntzleiterts. Previously the CEO of RubeWireless, Güntzleiterts was selected from the R&D team of Google as an expert most recently for a role “responsible for building market leadership and profitability.” She will report to Rangoolvoi’s board of directors.
“Liron Güntzleiterts has built strong company roots in San Francisco and we are excited to introduce her to Rangoolvoi as an expert partner and to lead our ‘Rangoolvoi  Day 1 2017 Startup Roadshow,” said Ben Bajinuk, Rangoolvoi and CEO, in a statement today."
"This week, Nokia released its first Android-powered smartphone, the Nokia 130. The handset is being focused on design and technology, in the wake of recent leaks of Nokia’s forthcoming Windows Phone OS.
On this week’s the show, one of Nokia’s top engineers showed us how Nokia would go about making its first high-end feature phone. The Finnish company has a device in the works called the Nokia X and it’s just like the phone that started its life as the N1: it uses a device basically like it’s a camera for taking photos.
But Nokia is not the only one entering in this space. HTC is also working on a phone. Google is also keenly chasing this one with a revamped, compact form factor. And of course, there’s Samsung trying to find its own way to success by launching its Galaxy Note Note.
Of course Nokia’s camera phone is just the beginning. There’s Nokia X; Samsung is trying to work on a new phablet-sized device. The company’s big plan remains on translating that app to the bigger form factor. And we just might see the next N1 launch in September or October."
"Editor’s note: Tomislav Wilkis is the chief of mobile development for Twilio.
The name Twilio is so old and simple to type that we hardly knew what it stood for. But it’s a hell of a lot of what it stands for today and, more important, what it gives the tech sector.
There are three big words that describe what it stands for: Fx1, X1 and S1r. With a little bit of a sigh of wonder. But the other word is what we will probably call the Twilio API. It stands for a platform, a platform, a bunch of words, the API.
So what is the word “platform?” What is the term “api?”
To keep up, we’re going through a transition phase. We used to call the Twilio API for all kinds of things. It seemed as long as you were doing some type of application. But the market has changed. All of us are using apps, we are not doing some special application that uses Twilio.
So what is the phrase “platform” then? A label for what you see. It may also apply to a developer of some kind that uses Twilio to deploy their applications on some kind of platform. If it comes to that, it may be just a matter of

, they’ll only let you search their names, dates back seven years and a partial list of their sexual orientation.
The other big changes come up as fewer people were allowed to join the site — around half (32 percent) are now notified of the changes because they can see them in the notification center on the homepage.
The last time someone posted anything publicly, this is when they had a lot of followers — so more people meant to the hassle of checking and checking out that person was used to posting publicly.
The founders asked in a public post last year about how the site tried and tried to get people to fill up for free website by sending them links to download a series of browser extensions to get them to write up publicly.
These were taken down, and the founders said they were still collecting donations. But by this week they realised there was little value in these requests because many of the people in question were likely to move on to another topic, at least until they find another way to monetise their public persona on the subject matter.
They’ve also since decided to focus their efforts on Twitter, having blocked accounts and deleted posts in the past to concentrate on their Twitter TV program. But that hasn’t stopped them dealing with other issues directly. They reported that a Twitter staff member, Chris Sacca, the founder of the celebrity-focused startup that helped popularise the tabloid media format, has finally tweeted out a link to the new site.
“It’s been almost a year now since my last tweet and I’m looking to publish this once again,” told TechCrunch. “The site is always my favorite place. It’s a well-designed, well-designed place, I have a constant flow of new content, interesting people come to the site, and the site always seems to be rocking. I’ve had one or two bad posts out of my mouth and I’m dealing with personal shit, I’m dealing with personal shit.”
“I’ve been on Twitter since the beginning. I haven’t tweeted in months,” he added. “Twitter is where most of my tweets got to be, that’s where the really interesting interesting tweets made. ‘Cause the shit is like crack.’
“I still feel weird,” he added. “I still feel weird.”
The most interesting things about Happn is the site’s user experience. It’s kind of silly to think of the site as just for sharing photos — it has a large, photo-centric component to it — instead this seems to be the primary premise, which explains Happn’s high-density, visual element (it’s almost like a photo-book in photos) to the rest of its user-base.
“Photography has been a major part of human civilization. The most powerful technological device in our history was probably the camera,” Cook added. “With our user-base, it makes sense to use it.”
“We’re not a media company,” Cook added, addressing several reasons why users would use Happn as their main feed. “We’re not interested in selling media. We don’t want to be viewed as a copy maker — we want to be seen as a real media company.”
“I wouldn’t say we’ve seen anything that makes us mad,” he added.
Cook said “the world is transitioning from analogue to digital… There’s a lot of change going on now because everything you see, video and pictures is online.”
As you’d expect, there’s another angle that makes the new media — not just in terms of the photos and videos but the accompanying visuals of what you’re seeing.
“It’s exciting that when the advent of digital into the picture and video is not necessarily the final picture that you see, the original image that you see has become so iconic,” he said.
“In the past, you would see what was happening on the screen and that’s how we get to what you see today,” he added. “Now you can see something on the screen and understand the context and how it fits into a screen that’s much much bigger and better than what it was.”
If you consider Happn is more of a magazine than a full-blown blog, then

 morphed.
In many respects the iPhone 6 is no slouch-board. However with a quippy processor at the heart, it also doesn’t look to be too bulb-crazy too — given the amount of screen real estate needed to make even the smallest mobile screen sustainable at this sort of size and resolution.
In case you were worried that extra baggage may result in slippery handles for your iPhone, the official Apple YouTube account confirms that it’s not the reason the iPhone’s bump in the port happened.
It’s a smooth sea, I’m afraid — the iPhone 6 is just as adept at handling bumps as the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, without needing much hand-wringing or finger-wringing at all.
So how did it happen, exactly? A lot of the trouble associated with bumps in the iPhone hinges on the way the two sensors for the back of the device were designed, meaning the screen is highly effective at sensing very slight changes in the environment — which is the very sort of thing that prevents the kind of interaction that the iPhone does in order to keep users inside the device.
However, a shift in the sort of direction that the screen typically travels when a user bends over a laptop or other device means that the iPhone 6’s optical component, the touch sensor, needed to be recalibrated, had to be moved slightly (and perhaps in real life without being able to make the requisite adjustment).
When that happens, rather than reaching for the edge of the device, the rearward motion of the iPhone causes the screen to move in the same direction and the sensor’s cross-section of the device tips aligns perfectly up for the new, relative touch detection. Just so long as the two sides of the iPhone still end up facing one another.
To that end, Apple says that in addition to standard rear-to-edge adjustments and around-the-edge movement corrections the iPhone 6’s optical quality has been given a bump up, too, with extra fine-tuning to better handle bumps in one eye, a slightly larger screen in the second one, and wider viewing angles in portrait and landscape by tweaking exposure, brightness, contrast and color/saturation.
The iPhone 6 Plus also sports a new dual-camera system — one two-sensor system and one wide-angle one, so that users for the most part will be able to take macro photos with one (single) lens. The main advantage is likely to be in the ability to take DSLR-style snapshots, to give you a more good idea of what the photo process is like, and to get a better picture overall of your settings — as you already knew, without the need to keep taking different pictures manually.
Also a useful addition is the newly introduced lightning connector for the iPhone — two A8-based camera elements that are, like the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, lightning accessories to help users bring the camera to other devices — meaning that when you are shooting with a new iPhone device in your pocket, the A8-powered camera and iPhone 6 Plus can be switched with just a tap at the back of the Phone or volume up button.
A few other changes include a new dedicated camera button on the top of the phone, a switch that enables users to take full, live, one-handed, all-access shots, a new app bar to get easier access to your existing shooting apps, and the ability to take and upload files to iCloud and Google Drive for free — something that users had been able to do but which had restrictions on their hardware design (and likely cost) for the time being. That’s also something that most current users probably have owned previously.
Apple’s commitment to the privacy of your data extends to a copy of iCloud photo libraries — something that has always been supported by its iOS software for users, who are able to keep their data in a sync box, to share with third parties, or use it for different photo libraries.
Users that currently do so will also get the privacy option, which will give them a way to retain more control over their data from other third parties. For now, Apple has added a feature that allows you to keep your data in a different app like another A8-based camera option.
We’ve reached out to Apple for new info on the iPhone 6 Plus launch and will update this post with any new information. A full review of the new device is expected to go up this week.

Apple has also dropped the size of the iPhone 6 Plus in a number of new versions for most. These new models now offer iPhone 6 Plus with 4-inches, 6 plus one additional inch and 7.5-inches, respectively

, and others. The goal of Nextdoor was never to attract its paying customers.
As one VC who closely follows the mobile payments space told me over the weekend, there were hundreds of millions of dollars of credit card transactions made through the platform over the last year, but if they just became payment options for developers, that would not be a service that would be profitable.
“The problem is that with any platform the problem is actually creating customers,” he said. “It makes it harder to develop the service…and then the more people using the service, the harder the revenue model will be to have to develop new business models for them.”
But the solution could solve two problems that are sure to attract attention and attention from the public: the first is persuading developers to use such a massive footprint as Facebook. The second is converting users who are already hesitant about making payments.
“Facebook payments made the experience much better than any other platform could. There’s no credit card associated with Facebook, there isn’t any issue with any other platform,” Venzatec said.
Venzatec knows that the company may attract attention and attention from the public market. But until now the company has not raised any money. In fact, he said they will consider it, but want to balance it out over time.
Nextdoor has appointed a chief marketing officer and three chief operating officers to help spearhead its efforts in terms of hiring and product development.
“Right now there are no people at the company that are specifically looking to be COO or operations. We have one COO and a couple dozen or so CIOs there, but they are all full-stack specialists and can talk to us and work with us and give us feedback and make sure we are being transparent with those who are not on the team,” Venzatec said.
To date, the company has built up a network of 70 local operators who are able to pre-authorize transactions and send people instructions electronically. That allows them to easily expand their network.
Venzatec said he and his co-founder are the only full-stackers at the company, and he has a clear path to profitability.
“We have a clear path to profitability, that has been a surprise to no one so far,” Venzatec said. “I expect us to either go to profitability organically or have a hard decision about whether we want to go to profitability. Right now I don’t think that the option is a really good choice for us. To be transparent, I wouldn’t like to go to profitability and have to keep supporting the company and being in perpetual need of investors and consultants.”"
"It’s been a long time coming. Wattpad, and its hyper-local web platform that lets users have a more ‘human’ experience’ with the written content on certain sites, first launched in 2009, and this week re-booted with a host of new features to flesh out that vision.
The first was the addition of user-level privacy controls — those that gave users the ability to change the content on a site, and even remove it if they didn’t like what it was doing. 
The second change wrought by the company — the option to now enable search queries on every site that is ‘searchable’ — was arrived by way of Wattpad 2.0, a standalone product (or ‘extension’) that was introduced in June, and has been a long time coming. The system had previously been in beta, and had been quietly developed by the team at the time of that move.
This week, Wattpad 2.0 officially went live, adding a bunch of new features and tools to its platform, including search and page management as well as an API enabling site owners to integrate the platform into their own apps/services.
Of course, a platform with more functionality in tow has inevitably been a boon for those wanting to run a query, no matter the system. And with users being a primary concern (who after all, isn’t that often the case with online services?), it’s a good thing to see those new features, making it easier for site owners to control who gets in front of what and at what time.
Wattpad CEO and Co-Founder Aaron Schildkrout is not the only one who thinks this is a good idea. The other week, for example, I wrote about App.net, a “competitive” website platform, which last year pulled in a sizable round of seed funding from Lerer Ventures, Highland Capital and others.
Today, App.net is open and active in App.net and Wattpad, having just been included on the App.net

 front and an easy, easy-to-use, fast and affordable video player. It’s a great platform for brands and publishers, as it allows for more ways to connect with their audience, including native ads.
However, for creators who don’t want to deal with the industry, Facebook-powered video player can be a great way to get early feedback on your video, and it’s definitely a better way to get a sense for what to do next. You could even imagine a video being used on television, on the web, in commercials and in your message to consumers.
The fact is that the Facebook format could have more immediate potential at a younger age, with younger audiences already demanding video content, and more eager to consume it online and on mobile, with little chance of discovering it or getting it from someone else. You get the point, then.
Facebook launched an embeddable player for video that made its debut on Foursquare this year, and got more than 100,000 new signups, according to the company. It’s great, but the real value of the player comes from what makes it possible to create interactive multimedia content around video, so users can watch it on their own.

Facebook has the best, and interactive, video player yet. Video from various sources on the web is now embedded in HTML5, as Facebook provides a better, full-screen format. There’s also a built-in browser extension that makes it easy to use YouTube, Vimeo and any other video player. On top of that, Facebook offers a complete library of tons of tools used by anyone who wants to edit or remix their videos, whether that’s YouTube, Vimeo, Vine, Instagram or another.
Combined, these different video player components create what’s possible, said Facebook’s Director of Product Management and Strategy, Eric Koester.
“It’s a full library of tools and solutions for video publishers, across mobile and tablets, social and from anywhere,” said Koester. “We also want to enable any third-party developers to build new content and tools for video publishers on Facebook’s platform.”

While these different library components were made possible through a new API, the bigger news is that Facebook is now allowing more traditional publishers to integrate these tools, though it will only take a few months before more platforms are made available.
Koester explained how the company can go further and allow any third-party to publish their own videos through video via the newly available API.

"Facebook has become the go-to social network for teenagers, according to a new report from comScore, out this morning. And that might just be the case. Facebook may just be dominating the young social networking site with its massive monthly user base, but social mobile app Snapchat is also growing fast.
A group calling itself the “daily app”, and released this report today, says that daily active users are on average 10,000 daily active users per day, and that Facebook has no foothold in the app beyond a few thousand downloads on Android. It also can’t claim to break the top 1,000 in the U.S. or Europe, the top apps by one measure.
Daily active user growth via social means another way to put the figures. We’ve heard similar stories about Facebook’s slow and steady growth among social apps recently about its weakness.
The group of people behind the study notes specifically that the iPhone app’s monthly user count grew by 15 percent over the past 14 weeks. And the Android app also grew 100 percent from November to the same month.
For the record, Facebook is the top social network by monthly active users. Snapchat’s new Stories feature seems like a strong contender here, but neither increase the monthly active number by any significant amount. Facebook dominates the market by far, even taking second position just ahead of Instagram.
The social app also rose in popularity just before the holiday sales rush. In November, Facebook was the best known brand to reach the most daily users in the U.S., with 715,000 users. In a holiday sales month, Facebook was the second-most popular brand in the U.S. with 596,000, according to comScore, behind the popular Instagram with 470,000.
The report also found that Facebook’s percentage of daily US phone users is now on par with Instagram, and after just a month the two are the number-two in the U.S.

The daily active user growth on Android continues to keep Facebook strong despite its massive size. At 4.99 percent, the mobile app that it debuted on November 20 actually had more than 10,000 DAU as of December 13, the report claims.
The report was released earlier

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 losing, but the next iteration is going to be “bigger and better” and take things beyond text.
The core new Facebook app is going to be called “Photo Sync” instead, because it’s all about the sync feature. “Sync” equates to a faster, more seamless way of using Facebook for all your photo collections. Here’s why the sync feature is called Sync.
“Sync does lots of interesting stuff,” Facebook product manager Michael Reckhow told me. “It really does the bulk of the stuff that you do on Facebook. That’s what we call it.” The Sync portion of the app was a previous version of the Sync app, because there was no offline state for your files.
Now, Facebook plans to sync up a bunch of your albums — Facebook wants to do that for all your of your old photos, not just those in your Camera Roll. You’ll see a notification that shows if another user Sync a Album, and the album owner can then click the Sync icon to go into their own Profile section.

There’s a Sync icon in the top left corner of the main screen. The red flag shows a blue box. The Sync icon in the middle right gives you a sync icon. When clicked, a small gray ring will appear as a ring of three blue dots around the bottom of the screen.

There are a few clever features. One, the Sync icon will flip your phone horizontally to put some distance away from all the other Sync apps. Instead, Facebook’s iOS and Android apps are displayed vertically. I hope Facebook will make the Sync icon as big as the Facebook button used on the right side of the camera.
At this point, Facebook has released a handy tool that lets you copy and paste photos from the Camera Roll into different albums. And this is a huge step forward from before Sync didn’t exist. “Being able to sync across all your cameras is absolutely critical for our mission,” Facebook product manager Mike Shaver told me.

In an Email, Facebook’s Product Manager for photo sync, Danny Onavo, shared this to me but gave me some really interesting details about Sync, how it works and why it could be important.

Most people don’t realize how important Sync is for Facebook. It’s a central part of how people interact on Facebook. While I don’t think I’m overly close to someone on Facebook who talks about this all the time, I respect a social platform that’s so dear to me that I want to keep it there.
And this has to be both a great feeling for Sync as well, as Facebook needs to help people realize that it’s one of their most critical components.
Being able to upload your photos to sync is time-consuming and scary for most people. So what Facebook did was make me a central part, not only in how I use Sync, I’ve always been a huge fan of the product itself.
“I’ve always said that photo sync is the most difficult part of syncing and that the reason people haven’t was that they thought we hadn’t done it,” I wrote in an email. Now, after three years, Sync 2 has gone viral and is now a brand new feature on Facebook. “I feel like the biggest pain point is still the syncing process.” The sync workflow is the biggest part behind, he says.
But what’s Facebook missing was the way that Sync worked. A lot of startups try to sync all of your devices so you can email your photos into Sync. But Facebook needed a much more unified way to view the changes. At its heart, Facebook was still using Apple’s Find Friends software. There are a number of flaws in the system that it could learn from.
“I think that the sync experience is really great,” Michael Reckhow said about the new Sync client beta. “In a way I think it’s the best user experience that Facebook has ever had. We want to be one of sync’s leading partners. That’s a really interesting thing to be a part of.”
The beta version also comes with a number of user-requested features and a “Notifications” feature that has notifications for when files change. Another feature that Facebook is excited about is the new “Shared album” feature. In a way, that’s the most important part of Sync 2 and why the company is including the update today. If people aren’t sharing files in a certain group often called a “Backup,” more often than not, the photos are then stored in its server.
Another important feature Sync 2 is getting has been the ability to send your photos to other

“He left [our company] with an unfinished product to sell to himself” because he wasn’t happy with the direction it took in his new direction, he said. “We started looking into the options and there was one … possibility we were going to go [insurve ideas about] … what we could do a new direction for the company.”
In his own words: “We could do something completely different. We could take the focus off our dreams of becoming the biggest consumer play and instead become that part of the $7 billion consumer app universe”. And so, the next decade or so, he was certain.
He had already raised $2M in funding, so with that $2M, he’d expect to raise another million next year. It’s something he says “is like going to a nightclub” and that’s what he’s trying to work on.
He’s also worked before in startups, consulting for several companies with his experience, he also helped launch a travel site called TripAdvisor — but when something hits a certain kind of scale, it’s time to go after the opportunity.
“One thing that is a little bit surprising is that it’s not that we’re not going to raise another round,” he said. “When you grow in a network of one million people, you start to have really amazing conversations with people because I was at one of the biggest companies and I was at one of the top companies and I was someone on the board and at one of the most elite schools in the country, the MIT team, and one of the best companies of your life. The conversations you having with your team are interesting. It’s good. When you have those types of conversations, then you have something really exciting.”
And what does he want to do with TripAdvisor?
He says that he wants to build out this travel business because he believes TripAdvisor is a real travel engine. A social travel network for people trying to book things to do is not an entirely different idea than what tripsharing was in the middle of the 90s and 2000s, and it’s still alive (or thriving) for some time, he says.
Going after the travel market, which he says is worth $30 billion, is an untapped opportunity and he believes his company can be a leader in it. A lot of companies focus on the search features in their platforms of course — not enough, he insists. The first version of his site has a pretty decent search feature for finding flights, hotels, restaurants and local attractions and it allows you to book flights, bus tours, sightseeing cruises and more. His design team, he says, is “six big data guys. Every single feature of the site is built with this data. It’s a little easier to use this data,” he says.
The site’s “proprietary knowledge” is what has allowed it to make big data a central focus and therefore be able to keep user access to what’s considered a personal piece of its database. This helps to identify people you know, for whom travel, not travel history, is important — the site is designed to give you a general idea of who this person is.
The travel part of TripAdvisor is just beginning, at this point, but even here, the founder says that it has some of the data the team is looking to be able to access. So, for example, it would be a good idea to know how much you really know the other person. If you think you know one person, why should you know the other person? (The site can help you answer this, though.)
Pricing is a big part of the site’s uniqueness, and it’s another area where TripAdvisor has excelled. It’s also hard to differentiate from TripAdvisor because TripAdvisor is designed to be a social site for people who are often traveling (more specifically, to avoid paying fees).
So if people are traveling, what does that mean for you, traveller? While it’s a tricky question because TripAdvisor is free of charge on the web and you can review a hotel anywhere, and even add your reviews to the service, it’s a lot harder on mobile as you can be pressured into buying things off the site. On TripAdvisor, you can pay for your hotel directly from the app. Travelers just have to enter where you have it, choose your room.
It’s not a bad thing for people who are only used to being told things like “good luck” and “the best hotel in town” after seeing an ad. But that’s also not good enough for TripAdvisor’s current traffic. According

 for the second-guessed security review.”
“We have some good precedents, but that is not much,” Sjogreen tells TechCrunch. “We’ve seen some leaks of other organizations, and some are pretty wild… We’d like to say, though, that we have nothing to do with that.”
The UK security agency, MI5, was one group to get the tech, and the decision to source it comes from the government’s desire to shore up the security services’ capabilities and expand, while the U.K. government’s transparency push continues (albeit without claiming in any of the articles on this subject).
MI5 notes in the article that this GCHQ spy agency has previously been called out for “serious” threats to its security system, and also has previously been said to have a “serious” capability to gain access to devices with a “severe” capability to access data on people, thereby requiring “pre-briefings” with data-gathering and monitoring processes to prevent any potentially criminal activity being undertaken. So GCHQ’s ability to gather and store this type of “real-time information” is not necessarily a “surveillance” capability, according to the MI5 assessment.
Indeed, the latter claim that GCHQ does not have a “pre-briefing” capability — in the traditional security “intercept” fashion — notes another discrepancy between MI5’s comments regarding GCHQ’s claims of its capability to obtain “a full service” and the government’s own reports on the capability to obtain “a partial service”:
The report claims that GCHQ “has been known” to “extract user data” — based on “one of the largest data-ministers’ assessments.”
MI5 says its intercepted data indicates that the “the most intrusive data,” as it terms its intercepts, was being used by GCHQ to gather “substantial amounts” of data (it doesn’t specify the specific encryption keys it is using, however). So the claim that GCHQ’s calls to be intercepted “violate a legal provision that have been broadly agreed” is a serious attempt to undermine our Fourth Rights.
“The Court of Appeal [sic] ordered GCHQ to act as an agent in a ‘precautionary measure’ that was not intended as a specific threat to national security. The court said GCHQ was neither employed nor obliged to act as an intelligence agency in the UK. The decision was passed on September 23 last year. The court of justice said GCHQ could be also breached if the powers set out in the law, as ‘the Act states’, are breached,” MI5 adds.
To back up its claim the “precautionary measure” that GCHQ is being employed as a covert spying tool is the fact that the agency states that it’s also intending to use the data it gathers to specifically target the U.K. security agencies’ cyber capabilities.
“We have received and are engaged in the assessment work to bring our analysis and the ability to exploit the technology to allow GCHQ to acquire ‘the most relevant information’,” the MI5 spokesman claims.
“The first of GCHQ’s orders, which relate to intelligence assessments, requires a general authorisation and is specifically addressed at the agency, but it is specifically ordered to be not used against a subject of that assessment. The orders have a ‘very limited overbale' period to be followed.”
This is especially noteworthy given that the security agencies apparently rely on a “technical capability” — called a ‘back door’ — to hack into their systems and obtain data they are able to access without a warrant. If the judge grants those authorisations, it would mean an even larger backdoor.
In a paragraph referring to the “recedent ‘encryption—” that GCHQ appears to have used in its surveillance capabilities, the MI5 says: “The latter is the most concerning because the agency asserts that the right to use these powers was exercised and it provides no assurance that that is the actual, operational purpose.”
MI5 notes that GCHQ has been using the back door to “harvest, maintain and disclose the contents of a particular electronic device,” without the court’s

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 search-based shopping app. I recently purchased a copy of Red Hot Dogs for iPad inside of a magazine cover. Before purchasing, I took a photo of the paper model my family had purchased.
So while you may not know about the history of Zuck’s company, a core part of it was a philanthropy that was centered around his child, Red Hot Rod. The company was “pioneer” in the minds of its founder, Mark Pincus, who cared deeply about the children in Zuck’s home before it became an empire. (The Rockefellers, as they were called, were among the wealthiest, though not always the best-dined. I remember sitting in the back of Mark’s father’s house and Pincus’s mother, Mariam, showed up after the dinner.)
Zuck also became known in media for the antics he used with employees, like him flaunting company assets with bikini-clad models and mocking fans. He got in big, trouble at least once, with ex-Facebook CTO Bret Taylor and then spent a little time at PayPal after it acquired his startup HiWallet. He’s had more setbacks, though, even than Pincus, who stayed for a bit. (Pincus sold his old HiWallet company to eBay last year and then bought it again for a surprising price I hear from multiple sources.)
After seeing that Zuckerberg was still at PayPal, he created the company’s Global Headcount. In fact, the company hired him, despite the fact that he wouldn’t be leading the team.
Then Zuck fired the company’s head of finance. Jacob Ner-David, a former PayPal general partner, went head of business for three years. (The company even promoted his general partner, who was formerly CFO, to SVP and became CFO once again. He’s since gone on a number of acquisitions.) During this time, Ner-David also restructured PayPal, which was arguably in need of a CFO.
Ner-David’s exit came after a lot of staff left over the last 10 years. Not only did he let a former head of business leave, but he also let a few senior executives leave as well, and then brought on board members like Chase Jarvis.
Then he fired those that he deemed weren’t really fit with PayPal. Ner-David, while a PayPal veteran himself, says he wasn’t fired for financial reasons. In fact he told me that it was because the company needed someone with more traditional technology experience.
That’s when he fired Ilya Fushman, PayPal’s head of global marketing and business development, who was CFO. Fushman had become COO after Pincus fired previous CFO Arielle Sustain and then cut his ties when he departed early last year.
In the end, it was Ceraron who heard the rumors and had the biggest voice, and thus gained access to the company documents previously locked up in his care. While Ceraron may be the ideal guy to have your back, Ner-David is someone to watch because his business and business model have plenty of appeal to startups.
The investor community has also amplified the story, tweeting out links to a number of the lawsuits. When one investor threatened to tell the other something horrible about the CEO, Ner-David told the Twitterverse that the investor in question had been lying (which I’m sure is what he was crying about).
“I have nothing short of contempt for those who are pursuing these frivolous lawsuits in an attempt to keep paying for our company,” Ner-David said. “Again, as a founder and entrepreneur, it doesn’t bother me at all.”
When Ner-David was dismissed earlier in the week, he told reporters he was relieved.
“They said that I did a bad hire,” he said. “Ain’ my face off with how stupid this is, that there will be litigation and my life is going to be sued out of the hell. I’m not going to give them the keys to my company… I would have to sue them first.”
There is a certain irony here: Ceraron is just the young man I hear of suddenly facing serious accusations of sexual harassment and threats. Not that that this a recent issue. I was told by a source at PayPal that the engineer had repeatedly groped, grabbed and groped her during a meeting while working on a product he was working on.
“These are false and exaggerated accusations,” the source told me. “As far as Silicon Valley and the tech startup scene in general, this is not surprising. My entire business model and the way I have built my company has been absolutely transparent from the beginning. I have not concealed anything and I’ve taken a beating

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 company is looking to hire more than 35 in the near future — it launched a full week of beta early look here — as well as launching mobile apps. It plans to go for 40 people, with a headcount of around 75.
For now, the plan is to work in the U.S.: New hires as well as an office space for the company’s U.S. sales staff will be opened in the next quarter, in San Francisco, and for its developers to make use of the new, customised service.
Boku’s main competitors in the B2B space include both banks and carriers, and startups including Square, Airtime, iZettle and Payleven. That includes the likes of the latter two, which lets merchants integrate services through its hardware or by piggy back on carrier networks, and recently launched its own solution that lets merchants on Amazon’s platform accept cryptocurrency payments."
"It wasn’t so long ago that Nokia was rumoured to be considering a slide in its next smartphone product portfolio: Android fans in 2012 would have heard that it was considering adding Windows Phone, but at the time of the Windows Phone-maker’s call in August, speculation was that it would not be the only carrier that would be supporting Windows Phone on phones “in the short term ahead of the handset launch later in the year”. A lot happened between then and late November 2013 when Nokia unveiled the Lumia 818, its updated line of Lumia phablets.
Android’s international growth has been staggering over the last year or so, with the platform dominating the global mobile landscape for more than 90 percent of smartphones it was sold in Q4 2013 globally, and only 29 percent of those were sales in the U.S. That, in short, means there is no question that Android is still the platform that the most popular smartphone platform in the world will be moving on.
However, the market for Android’s top two players has been somewhat firming up over the last 2.5 months, with Android market share now at 77 percent among OEMs in Q4. The story was different when it was announced by Gartner: when Gartner finally made mention of Windows Phone, it was no longer the sole Android OEM in the list, with Huawei taking the top spot, a drop that would have come as a disappointment if it was in a longer-term survey.
(As it turned out, when Gartner released its figures on Android growth in April, there wasn’t yet a dedicated category for Android on which it was measured: it was Android which is the second-largest category, after smartphones).
What has come into the light as this has come out has been the fact that Google has decided to break out the Play platform option for Google’s own Nexus phones, something that could spell trouble for the OEM.
“With the Play update for the Nexus 4, a number of key OEM’s are opting to develop Android for its platform, which will be differentiated from their other OEM hardware,” Google’s director of devices marketing, Angela Ahrendts, wrote us in an email to TechCrunch. “In some of these cases, OEMs will use a Google-built app store in order to differentiate their devices.”
There is, of course, a possibility that these variants could become commercially successful: Google has said it’s in the process of launching and announcing Play in more than 10 countries in Europe and China, but ultimately Play is still only another service on a chain that continues to be built out.
But that’s not the question. What we can count on, at this particular juncture, is that Google appears (or is currently) testing up a feature or multiple device models with Android in mind. At that stage, we are talking weeks or months, months or years, in the future, and it seems like the company has some hands-on experience in terms of how it wants them to respond:
On its own platform, Google has built a platform that can help keep users engaged with more than just the platform itself. It’s too early to say, but that’s kind of where you will be at, if you are following the company’s lead.
For now, Gartner seems to recognize that this is a major step away from what Google already has — and Google will look a lot more at its own platform in the future — and continues to build out its own business. We have reached out to Google and will update this post with any response.

ily, they are also talking about how they are trying to do bigger than a couple of others players in this space that are very early stage and have a very strong early user pool.
There are a lot of companies that are talking about how to get to a point where they are solving all of these problems and that they are bringing the market forward, and that is what all the great companies are talking about.
I am looking at a lot of companies early in their life cycle. I know in some ways they are not as mature as the other guys, but I’m pretty sure in the age of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, they are solving a bunch of problem.
TechCrunch: In the U.S., what is your favorite place to develop your product?

Elop: U.S. Innovation: There are some big innovations that have happened in the U.S. in the areas that are key to making the product better. The areas that are catching my eye the most are a number of the ones that are dealing with sensitive stuff like health care and safety. There are also some products of great quality, which is where I think it’s too often missed in the U.S.
In the UK, we have some of the biggest technology centres in the country, such as Facebook, Google, AOL, and Twitter; together those get a lot of attention and innovation.
But if you do look at some of the U.S. companies that are doing really well, the one that is doing really well is Microsoft. When there is a good innovation point in a city like London you can talk about innovation, and you can tell someone that it’s a big innovation problem because you are not able to do that in the heart of anybody."
"A new service, SkimBox, wants to be your cloud storage and collaboration toolbox. Its website lets you edit documents on virtually any type of file – you can edit in Microsoft Office, for example, but you can also edit a document from SkimBox itself. SkimBox has plans to add new features, a mobile integration and more.
SkimBox, founded by ex-Googlers, gives its services a Google Apps-like feel. You can send and manage files and collaborate on documents across different services like Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, Evernote, Facebook, iSkyDrive and Skype.
After signing up, you can search, add and store files from a variety of popular cloud storage and collaboration providers. You can also create your own files and folders with SkimBox, add folders and files from service such as Gmail or Box, or access files from your local device.
“Microsoft and Google [both] own 80% of the market, and you don’t get the value you get with Microsoft in exchange for being a public cloud storage provider,” says SkimBox’s founder and CEO, Daniel Eskenazi. “You can’t just use Dropbox for very simple collaboration and let anybody use it to edit whatever they want.”
Initially, SkimBox was a consumer-focused service. Users had to access the files on their computers, but the service offered a free tier for 10 users. That package includes a web interface and document management, while the premium offering comes with full access to the full SkimBox suite.
Since launching in December 2011, SkimBox users have grown 3x to hit 2.1 GB of storage. It now has 5,000 paying customers and 1,500 paid subscriptions on its secure cloud storage and collaboration platform.
With the launch of SkimBox Enterprise, the service is expanding beyond the consumer product, says Eskenazi.
With the Enterprise edition, an administrator can have more granular controls over who can connect to the service as well as how much storage they can store, and IT administrators can monitor who has accessed those accounts, and, on the enterprise side, the service can give users extended visibility into how data is being used in a company.
Microsoft, Google and others are building out infrastructure to manage many of these competing services, but, as a consumer company, SkimBox has a bit of a head start.
With a membership rate of $199 for users who sign up with invitation, users get access to a large directory of third-party cloud storage and collaboration apps. It’s looking more like a consumer play, than a cloud play, although Google may find itself competing with SkimBox in that regard.

A beta version of SkimBox Enterprise is being introduced next month, which Eskenazi says will include a new admin dashboard and better monitoring. Users will be able to add folders and files from third parties, and share mobile access for documents between teams."
"Hulu Plus, the streaming video service launched by Aereo in December, has today launched a feature in which users can “Skip” videos on the platform. It has long been

 . We should be able to move with the times and be very creative. But if not you’ve got a hasty reaction to what my writing makes us look like."
"At the end of September Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer made waves with a series of announcements in which she dubbed “Appswipe” for an entirely mobile, web-enabled app. At the time, we were able to detect what this might mean and our eyes were momentarily compelled to roll. The two days prior, Mayer said that the app would be a “social and fun way of accessing your Yahoo.” We took the bait and, over the course of a few hours, we discovered she was going to be talking about Yahoo’s plan to make every app with Yahoo Search.
The New York Times’ Nick Bilton got on the action. The company is already releasing apps that “mimic” its web services, rather than using them in a “smarter, more convenient way” of accessing them on mobile. (Just as I tried to find a good one that’s available on Android and web, this was the real search I wanted to look at. You can imagine how it was about to get used, and why why it’s a huge headache to take advantage of it.) Bilton’s article revealed Yahoo had a plan that would take away the “smarts” (which are the web browser, search, Yahoo Mail and mobile app) that each mobile app that includes “Search,” “SMS,” and “Seed,” which all currently exist on Yahoo’s sites.

I thought this was a serious issue for the company. In addition to its over a dozen apps with competing with Yahoo Search and other mobile-centric search providers, you’ll also find Yahoo Mail. Yahoo Mail is a bit similar to a lot of Google and Mail extensions…but it gets leaner and less prone to breaking new ground.
You can read more about the Appswipe issue here.
Mayer was initially defensive, and was unable to say if, how and why we had heard of this. She did admit that in order to get a handle on the “mobile web” trend, Yahoo had to embrace mobile to some degree, and this is a big one. But she’s also just the problem with Apple and Google’s mobile web dominance and market share on the web. What does that mean for Android users?
Now, I won’t answer that in detail, but I do feel I’m starting to point it out. Every other day, I get emails about a new one. The app we saw today could only have been in the realm of smartphones, and it’s not an answer to the mobile web. It’s an issue with the existing ecosystem, which is why the current, massive, existing, mobile distribution channels are so strong. They’re not enough, in my mind.
I don’t feel that a single Android app with a single line of code is worth downloading. That comes down to user experience. Why? Because the Android web is different. Its interfaces are cluttered, its search doesn’t always surface the most relevant results, its social features aren’t as intuitive, and it lacks the ability to go deep with a user’s network on a deep scale that might have been the Facebook of Twitter at one point, and now Facebook of Flickr. It’s not about whether or not you’ve had an experience that makes your mobile phone smarter, but whether or not you’re the one who has figured that out?
To say this is a problem is as much as Facebook itself is questionable. It’s the way the network works today, and the way that it’s been for so long that it makes so much of what’s in there.
All of this suggests there is some sort of problem waiting to be addressed, because the whole thing is a mystery. But if it’s not what we’re meant to know, it’s certainly something that’s hurting us.
[Update: Responding to my comments, a Yahoo spokesperson sent me this statement:"
"Google has made a change to its search algorithms on mobile devices, which will now return the names and links that seem to make the most sense. The changes are now rolling out over the next 24 hours, and the changes will only be seen by those who have enabled Google Analytics and Chrome extensions.
The changes come after it was revealed several weeks ago that Chrome extensions were getting access to a user’s search history, and later this week the company revealed that a Gmail extension would be

 monkeypad,” he said. “And when the app came out and people started to complain about it, we realized we had to do to what we call a ‘hack’ — let’s make this really easy to use. You don’t have to learn any new things. You just have to type your message.”

Terrash is designed for an iPhone and iPod touch, too, Rafael believes. He plans to develop for Android handsets and those tablets with additional keyboards, such as the new PalmOS.
“There is a huge market for touchscreens,” Rafael said. “There was a reason that the iPod touch was invented. For millions of people who have never used a keyboard and have no idea how to type on a touchscreen, this is absolutely critical.”
The $60,000 in seed funding the company raised from SV Angel follows from SV Angel, CrunchFund, SV Angel’s Alex Finkelstein, Betaworks’ John Porthis, Betaworks’ John Borthwick, Chris Dixon, Betaworks’ John Dink, and RRE Venture Partners’ Dave McClure.
Terrash will be rolling out its iOS and Android versions in the next three weeks, Rafael told TechCrunch.

"Social video sharing network ShowYou is partnering with television news network Univision to launch an Election Center, a startup aimed at giving users access to real-time news about local candidates.
The company hasn’t developed any technology to help users find channels from the show’s Twitter streams. But Twitter integration is planned. ShowYou says that users will be able to follow the candidates’ tweets from the campaign page on Twitter, where they can engage with the campaign page and tweet their support for the candidate.
The startup plans to release a Twitter integration this summer, and Univision is currently running a test to let people tweet news stories from the Trump-Clinton campaign platform, although the company has no plans to add or install Twitter integration for its political platform.
The news of the election platform comes two weeks after an interesting partnership between Twitter and CNN (which Twitter just acquired for $3 billion) that helps users determine when to follow the candidates depending on how they feel about various issues.
But this really isn’t the first time Univision has been trying to leverage its relationships with Twitter, the media outlet with the most followers and the election coverage it creates.

In 2012 Univision built a Twitter account, focused solely on Mexican politics.
But when Univision President Donald Trump got involved in the debate by tweeting out a quote from a speech he was giving (as quoted by Businessweek), he inadvertently featured the Univision Politics account as his official campaign tweet.
The Univision Radio Twitter account is now a feed of what’s tweeted, not a clone, but shows from the new Univision News Channel.
The Univision News Channel is based on the Twitter account of Trump and Univision’s @Reynolds, and that’s where the channel’s news is published.


It’s unclear how Univision makes money with the tweet program. While Univision makes its money through advertising it sells the platform for the company to generate more traffic on its platform and social networks, the channel’s biggest focus has been its news and video channel.
Twitter, however, is a far more widely used social media platform, and it brings with it the ability to reach millions of people and drive high-traffic levels on its service.
For Univision, which has long been considered one of the cable and satellite TV news stations, the move to get its brand in the spotlight is a natural one and will likely prove to be more beneficial at reaching Univision’s over 65 million viewers.
The Univision Twitter account will tweet out candidate speeches, and Univision will offer viewers the ability to follow them and discover their accounts as they change topics on the social network.
But the video isn’t just being a news feature: the election platform could offer a “real-time” option across shows, with images, videos and more pulled from Twitter.
What’s interesting, though, is that the platform is built as more of an aggregation service — something that could tie into what Univision already offers through its other channels, like cable and satellite TV.
For example, Univision News could link to Twitter and Twitter streams of all the candidates’ tweets. Twitter would then have channels like MSNBC, ABC’s World News and CNN that its users could follow to see their news.
But that doesn’t begin to explain yet another way that Twitter has tied its new partnership with Univision to its platform,

 release them today).
The app has been in closed testing for the last month, but is opening to the public today.
It’s also worth noting that a number of startups have turned to Amazon to help fund their initial efforts. In recent weeks, for example, it appears that the funding sites are now redirecting to the corresponding apps when a developer is searching for the necessary ingredients.
The app’s launch follows the debut earlier this year of an app of the same name from the same developer — this is called One Cash, and it’s still working as it has no specific launch.
The company says it’s currently accepting sign-ups for its public beta and iOS app through a special link.
One Cash is another example of how a marketplace can grow when the product itself isn’t selling itself, as Twilio has done with other services like Amazon Payments. Twilio’s services are specifically aimed at helping developers and app developers make money — and Twilio and its ilk are now making some serious money at about $60 billion in yearly payments processing. Twilio’s head of global head of sales, Alex Roetter told me that he thinks the company’s move to provide a mobile payment service is a step in that direction.
“The mobile web was not the original revenue strategy for Twilio,” Roetter said, when I brought up the possibility that this could be part of the company’s larger moves to evolve to support other services for developers, including ones like Uber, which had earlier been very closed off by its own company. “But now some of the best minds are working on developing for it,” Roetter said. “We’re giving back, we’re starting to create an ecosystem where developers and users start from zero.”

And judging by what Twilio does about its growth, it seems that today the company’s clients are not as reliant on the platform as they were in its previous years. (The company says that its business revenue for apps and analytics for apps grew 1.5 x year-on-year, which, in short, means growth is now even faster than it was a year ago.) As a point of comparison, enterprise is now at about $22 billion — a 100 percent growth year-over-year.
Still, there will not be any direct sales of its existing customers using the new service.

One Cash competes with other loyalty services. However, some of that may have to do with limits placed on the services at the time — for example, One Cash requires users to be logged-in, while Basic Cheques requires people need to have an account with the company before making any purchases.
Another area that may have been a bit limiting for early-career-focused users (and the general public, of course) is the fact that people need to be verified — at this point, all of the transactions are verified. For example, any transaction made with One Cash checks in on all of the transactions on its platform.
One Cash itself has also been growing in the past year. According to its official announcement of new funding, the company is now “one of the leaders in the loyalty space” and “the largest free cash-back merchant platform for small business owners — and continues its mission of becoming the universal wallet.” (The company, by the way, had raised substantial funding this year — a Series B round from angels from Canaan Partners and NEA.)
Update: One Cash blog post is below"
"If you’re a front-end developer, a lot of people will be calling you to help them run an ad server. Then why aren’t you? While in the past, they’ve been pretty helpful and helpful, they’re a bit annoying and they sometimes take so long to do a job that they really need to do.
That’s where Adzerk, the Y Combinator-backed startup launching today, wants to be a more general service. Instead of working with a bunch of startups, it wants to work with the very best developers and publishers — like those who sell online or mobile games or any type of online game where they’re dealing with a lot of constituency.
To build that audience, Adzerk works with the developers (and in its service, not unlike Shopify) and then matches them with publishers (and publishers in turn) with specific jobs. For example, Adzerk is currently working with GameSerge, one of the leading mobile game publishers in the U.S., to build an online game that’s expected to go live in the second month around.
Co-founder and CTO Andrew Reiss says the service was an idea that came to him and he wanted to make it because he experienced

sharing the app to your Facebook account.
Like other sites that rely on Facebook users to help grow their mobile user base, Twitpic actually lost its “Trending” tab during the early days, but it quickly gained that feature back in before it shut its doors. While it still has a “Favorites” tab under the tab’s main home page, Twitpic’s version of the Trending tab has been more or less the same, though it displays the newest blog posts and shares one-third of the time.
The social network has been busy with recent launches, including new Moments, Meme-style layouts, and more. It’s also launching the first of its third-party apps for iOS 8, an OS that has become one of many Apple’s mobile OS favorites. 
And it recently gave a big talk at Internet Week and the Open Compute Summit in order to showcase how well its new server architecture has “worked” — that is to say, how well it manages both bandwidth and storage. This app helps on that front by helping users to use the iPhone they already bought and use, if their Android or Mac were they to begin with.
Another coming out of the project will highlight another new feature about what Twitpic is working on that’s already in development: the ability to push and pull images from the site. It would allow you to use both your own iPhone to get those photos into your Facebook feed — and then have the feature auto-push your images into place for you if you happen to also want.
If the idea of sharing and viewing content from your Facebook feeds sounds familiar, then that’s because that’s exactly the same functionality that Twitpic and Facebook are developing for their own mobile users.
For now, though, it’s unclear what Twitpic will be launching next. The team doesn’t want to pre-launch for fear it will fail, so perhaps no launch is imminent. But it will have to overcome “slow,” they say, as they’re planning on adding features and adding more features to the app before they think about how to scale.
If it’s any consolation, the app is free."
"The makers of the popular social discussion network Quora, which Facebook bought and revamped in 2010, told TechCrunch that they just added another service to its social graph. The company has now just pushed out a new addition to Quora that integrates with Pinterest. The integration with Pinterest follows a trial the company has run which would allow users the ability to track their interests to see things like their interests in other people, specific topics or topics of interest, along with other specific interests, and then learn more about their interests through sharing and browsing. Quora offers the ability for users to post and view the interests of others on the service, too.
The Pinterest integration adds an additional layer to Quora, and Quora’s answer to Facebook is still not a Facebook native-app, although a spokesperson explained last week that this integration will allow users to gain access to Quora content through Facebook, too.  However, it is a sign of the company’s growing interest in expanding its content and engagement around its social platform — something that’s been ongoing since Quora was founded back in 2005.
The most recent round of funding was around $41 million in May of last year, when founder David Karp said that the company would in the near future be releasing a version of its service that was social and had social-graph aspects.  Today, the company’s services remain a popular part of the social site (and Quora-owned side of the app), so it’s reasonable to think that, with Pinterest and other potential integrations, the company as well could be looking to tap into those for better (and more targeted) user engagement.
A Pinterest integration, of course, comes at a time when social networking sites are finding themselves increasingly hard to use, especially among younger users. The site has a long history of adding new interest-based groups, and many of those communities can’t even gain traction beyond the younger demographic. Pinterest’s interest platform has yet to launch yet, and it wouldn’t have even signed up this early if it hadn’t secured the Pinterest integration from a well-known Pinterest customer. Plus, as the company has built out a userbase who don’t necessarily think of themselves as being online 24/7, it could see Quora as a place for people who want to keep up with their friends when they are out and about, like mom and dad, or college friends.
The integration with Quora lets the site allow more general users to sign in and, more specifically, those who enjoy commenting and engaging with others. When someone subscribes into the Qu

 to play with. The biggest draw of the game, according to founder and CEO Peter Relan, is the fact that it’s a “social environment” rather than a place where you just go to connect.
Rolan was previously chief product officer at the Huffington Post, and co-founder of social reading service Pulse, where he was eventually ousted. As new CEOs, he’s trying to lay out a new position on a new company that’s trying to figure out what it should do to stay relevant as digital business have collapsed.
In the case of Planet Labs, it should try to get the attention of the fact that the company has already raised $10 million. Its success has been based on a lot of experimentation and a focus on the idea that it can build a gaming community that doesn’t just want to play casual games, but also one that’s passionate about them. As Rolan put it, “This is an important step to validate this vision.”
The round was led by Highland Capital Partners with participation from Benchmark Capital as well as new investor Sapphire Ventures, as well as former PlayStation president and long-time investor Jon Cholm.
“I’m definitely sold on this focus on building games here,” Rolan said. “There’s an unexploited core in social games, but they’re not really playing at the top of the charts. We’re focused on building a social gaming network.”
As the platform has grown, Planet Labs said it’s become “more and more diverse.” The first few projects it’s building include ROLI, and Planet Rescue: Planet Killer (aka Planet World). Both of those games, as well as third co-developed with another team at Planet Labs, are about big data.
Beyond that, as Rolan continued to put it, “Theres lots of people who wanted to build games but didn’t have the manpower.” Now the team is working to make games like Planet Shark more accessible to casual players, focusing on a free-to- play format.
The company’s success is due to the success and ease-of-use that the team brought to bear on a relatively short time window, and also to the fact that a typical social app that’s just launching the same app in one city isn’t enough to keep people coming back to it. Planet Labs, which was started by an AllThingsD colleague and was incubated by TechStars New York, has also been able to tap into the power of social networks (which is what many developers (including this reporter) have been experimenting with right now.
Planet Labs plans to expand its community and features, both of which will help it compete more with other casual gaming giants.
“We have lots of data on our community that’s been through the platform,” Rolan said. “We’ll be able to make sure we have great data to measure this.” He also emphasized that Planet Labs is “one of the only platforms” on the market at this time, meaning it doesn’t necessarily have to go out and buy an advertiser to develop your game. Instead, it also plans to use some of these new funding to continue to grow its community, with the first game added to its platform (Jam) and more in the works."
"As you know by now, I tend to get pretty annoyed when people post social network updates in full. I’m not a fan of being patient and not seeing their updates for the purpose of learning. So I asked one of Facebook’s PMs of mobile app developers, Marcus Lee, why he didn’t get a proper response out of the blue.
“This is not like an algorithm trying to predict that you want to read an article. If there is a lot of activity that can be inferred by seeing something, the algorithm could get confused in the future,” explains Lee, an illustrator based in the New York and Asia-Pacific region.
“The more important question is how long it took Facebook to come up with this,” he adds. “Facebook didn’t release it in 2013 because it didn’t want to make money from this usage. The site was growing really fast, and most people don’t even play games. Facebook doesn’t have a history of ever releasing an update for mobile.”
When asked why Facebook didn’t respond sooner, Lee points out that the company made a mistake by allowing too many people to share at the same time.
He also says that he was “too busy” to respond that way, since he worked at PayPal for three years, so wasn’t worried about being able to respond to all the messages he

 dramatically that,” Zohar wrote to me last week. “I don’t know why there was this sudden jumpiness. The company just had a completely different vision of what this company should be.”
And here’s why Nas and Zohar did so well to sell Tango to HTC in 2013 – it wasn’t just about getting the attention of some of the world’s top brands, Zohar said. In fact, it was also about getting some of the world’s top brands in search of new ways to market themselves.
And now the two companies are trying to turn that new vision into a real product and business. Last week, Nas announced that they were releasing 10 Tango apps on Android just recently, and that he hoped that other apps would follow shortly. When asked his new app strategy, Nas explained that he hoped more would join, as the Tango platform will grow organically the way apps grow on Facebook.
He noted that mobile search apps only grew the following way over the last year, and all the other search apps he’s developed since have been limited to one function. So Tango is much larger than some of the other mobile apps announced, and even if it makes apps more social, it still needs to do the right mix of things properly. It’s a tricky balance, and it remains unclear what Nas and Zohar will manage as long as they remain under-the-radar. In fact, Zohar talked about Nas’ new app vision becoming the new social search app, Quixey.
But Tango is a business. Tango charges a base fee of $19.95 for the device and includes all its prices into the price of the device.
So, for now, Tango is very much alive."
"There’s no shortage of places for music streaming users to go to get personalized recommendations from their friends and influencers. But the idea of tapping into that concept has not yet been applied to music, despite the popularity of personalized streaming services.
But the team behind an app called Songza has launched a new service that goes one better by giving music fans access to expertly curated playlists controlled by their friends.
That said, it only shows up playlists in the cover story. And even when it does work, most of the songs are just background noise in the background rather than things to listen to on the device.
The company has also raised $4.6 million in Series A funding. Investors in its most recent funding round include SV Angel, Chris Dixon, Y Combinator co-founder Paul Buchheit, and others.
Songza launched out of Buchheit’s startup studio Awem with a pretty clear business model: TuneIn mobile radio. But the company has grown quickly thanks to some big partnerships with record labels and, with the music industry, to get this service off the ground.
The Songza app already has a bunch of music partners. It’s also announcing some solid partnerships in its new music vertical, including Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, and Universal Music Group.
The app already has 50 million “plays” — the units that are basically audio tracks that can be customized to your tastes. If you want to browse the app’s library (which holds about 5 billion plays), you can follow other users and the right ones. Fans could then receive personalized updates that would affect your music listening habits.
While that all sounds great in theory, it’s not exactly easy to actually make music recommendations that work for you. You may have some friends who have played some popular songs in the past, but the next set of songs may not be on the list. You need to listen to them beforehand to get a good playlist.

If you try to get all these tracks from the same artist, Spotify has ads on the side that suggest that you look at a particular song for the first try or buy the track, but that will be difficult to accomplish. Songza has tried to introduce more personalized updates to get around that, but I’ve been hearing that it still hasn’t cracked it.
In the past, Spotify tried to encourage people to follow artists that they might like to hear, but that doesn’t work quite as well. Eventually, the company will add new functionality that will pull songs up based on what you’re listening to. I’ve heard many stories about Spotify simply forgetting to add songs for people who are actually looking at the top plays, but I’m not convinced that there needs to be a mistake or a pivot to another service altogether.
I’m hoping that Spotify brings onboard some of its smartest and most expensive music technology so that its service sounds better, but I don’t know if they’ve cracked the code.
If they do, the company has huge potential.

 – it only has an estimated value of $10 million per seat.

In 2012 alone, the company grossed $40,000 in bookings — and $10,000 of that was from its original app for iPhone. (That would be $5,000 from the app.) But this is changing this month with the addition of a new iPhone app.
That means its iOS app has been downloaded in total, going one million customers since launching in June 2012. (The company tells me that these are all active accounts that have joined the service.)
With the iPhone app, the company says it’s adding roughly 1,000 customers a day. (They didn’t have a recent iPhone version when we bought it, but I guess that’s okay for now …)
The company is also announcing that it now has 6,000 apps and 200,000 unique monthly acts. I’ve actually asked about the numbers, but I can probably safely assume that the app has been a lot more popular than the original iPhone app.
The new iPhone app includes the following features:
— A unified address book. When you meet up with someone, you can send them a Facebook Message and you’ll be able to add them onto the list.
— You never have to send a photo. You can send a photo with a caption and that person will get it — instead of the photo with the caption you want them to see. You can send a photo with a status update and a phone number. If you have a phone number for someone else, you get their phone number too.
— More social data. A friend can now join just via a phone number, not a phone number or email address. One feature that makes it interesting is the ability of adding anyone to a group by inviting them on “warships” — or a private message without their number. In some cases, these will also be very large groups. For instance, your brother could invite all of his friends to dinner.
— You can now message people directly with only their name. If you’ve ever provided a phone number, you’ll be able to add that to a phone list that will be accessible on your friend’s phone.
— Social search could give you recommendations based on music that you’re listening to. Or it will build your Facebook profile based on what you listen to.
As for the new, more lucrative business model, the app comes by way of a white label offering. The white label, at the very least, should be a good way to get additional functionality and integrations into the app without spending much more time building other features.
In terms of revenue, it doesn’t sound very likely to turn into a huge part of the business. According to the App Annie report from August 2012, the app was seeing 9 percent month-over-month growth and had 1 million active users.  A source tells me they aren’t sure if they will push the business forward more aggressively or if there will be a paid version, “but we’re still seeing that a lot with casual [usage],” the source added.
It still may take a while for the new app to hit all the right features, and it’s worth noting that the original iPhone app never made it into the app store there.
As for the app update today, it includes more of the new features. There’s also an improved iPhone 5-optimized interface and the return of the “Photos” tab, which has been updated to show the photos you’ve taken with the new Photos app. It’s also coming to the US and Germany in January with full worldwide rollout coming soon.

"Google isn’t just throwing the kitchen towel on your last week of showers — it’s actually washing and folding your clothes each month, and tossing in a bag of clothes to take along with the towels.
The new service is launching into private beta, and is specifically aimed at families with kids 7 years old and younger. To get started, a new user will be invited. Once invited, they’ll have several options to choose from: a dry washing bag of 4-14 towels, a wet dressing with folders (which will come in a waterproof box), an in-car dryer or a dry bag of any size.
When the recipient of the request has asked for the “dry wipes”, they’ll also be directed to the towel case with a camera. There they’d choose from, then pay for the dry cleaning.
The idea is reminiscent of other initiatives underway at the tech scene in San Francisco to foster collaboration by working with local businesses to find ways to increase gross margins against competitors. The “Box of Awesome” initiative is one that was

 factor in the UK’s financial system,” he said in a statement. “In many respects, the UK is already Europe’s financial hub, but if we do it faster than anyone else in the world then I think we can become the world’s largest financial hub. It starts with a simple idea, but for me personally, it meant to bring our nation back to where it started.” 
As an example of how the EU’s financial system works (for those in this side of the pond), the UK is the world’s fifth largest economy with £72 billion in private sector employment (with a huge growth predicted by the UK government as a consequence); unemployment is estimated at over 500,000. 
And if you really look at the country’s “private sector employment” (“sector analysis”) and there are nearly 7.2 million businesses and individuals who are “producers” and “sellers” on the UK’s eCommerce market, it’s staggering that, in addition to the nearly 20 percent of all the businesses in the country who are selling online, 80 percent of those transactions fall within the remittance market, which, given Britain’s size, has proven to be a lucrative (and unregulated) market. That’s because the UK’s financial infrastructure has been built in such a way that any country in the world where one is allowed to “exchange currency for one” is effectively “self-defending” against the US dollar, which is how the UK’s system is funded. That’s because the UK is, along with some other European countries, defined by the International Monetary Fund, a member of the World Monetary Fund as the UK’s 23rd country in the world, and therefore, regulated by the UK’s regulations. In other words: if you want to compete, you have to accept money, which is where the British have drawn almost all their money since 2000.
On the other side, the UK government views the creation of the Pound as a way of keeping the UK one step ahead of the rest of the world in the world of eCommerce. “We have an important contribution to the Pound as a way of providing stability at home and to the rest of the world to help promote and encourage the development of the UK’s digital economy,” the Treasury said in January this year.  
The idea behind the Pound’s creation will not just be to keep it “on message” in the UK, but to provide another, even more stanch to the UK’s economy, making this also the new normal."
"Back in 2007 I interviewed an ambitious, and fairly intelligent, startup: SumUp an ‘in train’ payment platform. Today it’s announcing the close of a $16 million Series E financing round, funded by new investor Insight Venture Partners. The investment is in the company’s European headquarters in Brussels and London, including an office in the US.
The financial terms of the funding were undisclosed, but SumUp has confirmed to me that it’s “substantially high.” What we do know is that its valuation has increased substantially since its last funding round, when it signed a $7.5 million Series A round, valuing the company at $10.7 per share. This round is about double that.
Investors clearly like what it’s doing. SumUp says it now has more than 10 million customers and is seeing double digit growth every month. The company tells me it’s planning to expand to the UK market soon, but with a plan to enter North America in 2016 “soon.”
With the new investment, SumUp will become a “major player in Europe”, according to Insight Venture Partners’ Jeff Lynn. “SumUp is set to take as far as Scandinavia’s Scandinavia in terms of local transaction and local merchant experience. Many small businesses have suffered recently as those who used to have an adequate way of making a small business have had a difficult time. SumUp has given them a simple, safe and secure solution.” Lynn also mentions Germany’s Number10 as an advantage.
Interestingly, the growth of SumUp mirrors an activity in Europe at least in terms of startups looking to invest in startups trying to ‘rehumanize’ the ‘frozen past’ of our entrepreneurial past. Startups like P2P lending platform Lending Club, peer-to-peer lending platform and Siergazr are all targeting the same market in Europe and North America and are entering the fray with fresh capital to fuel the fires.
However, it seems like investment in startups in this space is not as easy as most may believe; a lot of

,. However, these kinds of data don’t appear in social media monitoring services. These data sets, and their impact on business, may sometimes be hard to tell, and so apps have emerged to take advantage of this challenge.
One, for example, is the app Storify, which is designed to look at anything that’s posted on social networks and other sites, to try to predict what other apps or sites they may be using. This is important for, ahem, discovery. And, as a whole, the rise of apps like Storify, Vurish, GetFeedback, and a slew of other startups, is making it increasingly important for app marketers to know what users are actually doing. This is, it seems, where consumer-level social tracking becomes a key data asset.
The other common piece is when apps cross between social networks and other sites in a novel way. For example, Storify and GetFeedback are two apps whose creators I’m told met recently in Dublin, Ireland, because they used their different social graphs (more social than other) to determine which of their followers were most likely to not simply cross paths with the app. Another app called Spyle was recently discovered in the social space after it ran a successful Google search to find people using the app to share “social network content,” and another, called Venda, is using a similar approach in terms of showing what social networks users join.

What does one might think of Google discovering and making purchases of these social clients — in fact, that activity has been monitored by Google (at its time of the acquisition, at least) and there was apparently “many cases” of these app users using services provided by Google. Google notes that, at this point, the information they provided is to date only for iOS devices.
In the case of Taplytics, the app is being used to understand usage patterns between web and mobile apps.
These mobile app analytics providers come in various sorts of flavors, but many rely on user-supplied data, but in some instances do not provide this kind of data on the app itself.
For example, here at Viruvore, it’s interesting to see how different business categories’ growth is correlated with time spent:

What’s interesting in this case is that, while the site may not be providing the most data to do so, it’s at least providing a useful measurement – it’s the one that shows which kind of app is being downloaded across social networks around the world, and not which site.
The interesting thing about all of these different types of app-making services is that there appears to be a bigger trend here of using apps to show what it has to do with other sites’ data sets. It’s clear that many of these startups will end up using the same method as the one they’re using for capturing the data around apps’ usage trends.

"Tattoo culture and the concept of self-harm, or social media, is a big topic these days. I’ve gotten tons of really intense pestering about the concept at TechCrunch and I think it’s a good idea that I’ve posted it here rather. It’ll be interesting to be updated with anything that anyone can tell me.
As of today, Tattooing is officially banned from Google Play, the search giant’s service.
Tattooing on Google Play will, of course, mean your apps have to be approved by Google. However, apps that allow you to “attune” yourself are still free through the App Store, Google Play and Google Safety set, but will have to comply with the same new requirements by the site. I personally don’t think it’s a good idea to upload a video of yourself to YouTube, but that video is now a public image on Google Play."
"A pair of ex-Microsoft Bing engineers have recently left Google with two months of Microsoft job offers in the mailbox… because no one wanted to go back.
Bing, you may recall, is perhaps Microsoft’s answer to the question, “why would anyone want to use Microsoft’s search products again?” (I don’t mean that in the way you probably do; I mean why not, I just made that up.)
I’m no conspiracy theorist here.
Instead, the question is this: What about Google, Google and Google’s other search products?
Google’s product suite includes Gmail, Search, Ad and Ad Search, and it’s designed to keep your personal info out of Google, like, Facebook, Twitter, Twitter and so on.

 consumers can access their data on how many times a song or series has been released, for example, and get statistics and graphs on their own usage.
To help pay for the launch of its API, Songkick is also announcing it has raised $2.5 million in seed funding from Lerer Ventures, SV Angel, Roger D. Carter and Jeff Pulverman.

The idea for Songkick came from cofounders Steve Jang and Dany Fishel when they were at Sony. They wanted to make an app that would give music fans a place to interact with artists they are passionate about, instead of reading reviews from sites like iTunes. Jang and Fishel experimented with using crowdsourcing platforms before settling on Songkick, which launched last year.
The app allows you to follow along with your friends, following along with them or following their YouTube videos:

With the mobile app and the API available, Songkick is looking to leverage these networks and collect usage data around musical engagement, helping it to create an app engine that can identify trends, like the biggest album release date, for example.

In terms of the types of music you’re playing and what you’re following, Songkick gives you a song rundown and the same info on all your favorite songs. But the coolest feature comes by way of its trending charts, which allow you to see how songs are trending and build a personalized music playlist.
If Songkick can make you understand trends on the music market to make predictions, it can aid in discovery by giving artists bigger share when necessary (and maybe making them a household name) so people get excited about what they’re hearing. The app is also working to build a smarter, more nuanced Trending section of its chart, that will start to understand things like the most re-watched song over time, for example.

There are already over a dozen companies in the app discovery and recommendation space, from Apple Music, Amazon, Songkick, Flipline, and more, and a few of them are only available in the U.S. As of today, Songkick still has a number of competitors, including Apple Music’s recently launched Listen With. Spotify may have the advantage, but many musicians still haven’t seen a mobile app that can make sense of their music, and when it comes time to pick up a song, it’s still Apple Music because it features a chart.
That alone could convince some to ditch their music streaming service.

The app also offers a colorful, interactive user interface to help you enjoy music, and it’s all the more appealing because of the discovery aspect. Unlike some, which offer a simple, one-question quiz-style search box, Songkick is a little like a social network, with an interest graph and profiles that you follow.
For example, a music industry insider would ask you what kind of music you’d like to hear. A friend would then answer like “The Country Club,” whereupon a song would begin showing up. You could scroll through their hits, and they’d be added to your daily playlist.

The app has also introduced an even more interesting social component called Live Share. With Live Share, you’re able to follow all of your friends and playlists on Songkick, so it makes sense that the app will share its data with its friends, who may be downloading the music with you.

While Apple Music has done wonders for Apple Music’s growth, a huge part of that growth still comes from Spotify users. If Apple ever gets deeper into the music app market, just remember that there are over 21 million Spotify users, and their activity is still going.
But Apple doesn’t want that to be the kind of growth that it can’t afford to continue developing. As The Wall St. Journal pointed out, the company is already ailing after the failed rollout of Apple Music, and a survey from the American Music Society found that 68 percent of Spotify’s respondents have already gone the “music listening” on Apple Music."
"After months of trials, Nielsen today is finally making a call on broadband usage that helps the company improve its own lineup of TV shows and other data on how TV sets and other devices are connected to the rest of the household. Nielsen says it is getting this info in front of TVs — household members only — and is now preparing a formal program to take care of it. 
This could bring more TV providers on-board, as well as the likes of Google and Netflix looking to add some cable-based entertainment to their growing cloud ecosystem. While a lot of cloud and cable services have to build out their own connected services — not just voice-based services — this could also mean more revenue for those companies and a better return on investment.

 variety of users is a good signal, and so far, the company has focused specifically on growing its user base by targeting them more narrowly with content designed to draw and entertain fans, who can now engage with each other and share links from websites.
The second change will involve the addition of ads. On the ad front, this will continue to be a separate thing, and not part of the new design.
For now, Facebook, which began testing ads with businesses in late April, doesn’t yet look like it has much of a customer base to market to beyond those in the United States and Canada, but it’s working with a variety of different ad buyers, from companies like Groupon, for example, that have the reach of tens or thousands of dollars (via AdMarket).
Facebook would not say if or when this could roll out more, but it’s an important building block for how the platform will continue to grow, as the company prepares to launch its new mobile app in the next few months, and also a new app this week that is entirely focused on local content.
Updated with new user numbers and details."
"In March, Facebook raised $19.3 billion to buy WhatsApp, but as it said at the time, it would start rolling it out to users in the “near future” to use it to become what its CEO of product Stan Chudnovsky referred to as “a global telecommunications platform.” Now the rollout seems to be complete, as Facebook today rolls out the feature to its global developer platform.
Chudnovsky started talking about advertising last week in an interview with our own John Biggs. He is the one who brought in his team to work on them through all the way back to their California universities. He made this a point to the audience, and the entire audience at the Facebook developer conference (read: a big audience) cheered when he talked about the news.
As part of an effort to make WhatsApp more of a “social communication platform” rather than just another app, Facebook is rolling out new features. Facebook’s director of platform for advertising Gokul Rajaram said that now, when a user is trying their current app, they have to go to Facebook’s main page to find out how to get started, which is a bit confusing and a challenge for the user.
Instead of having a new tab popped up every time a user opens their app, Facebook is giving them this always-visible notification that has them instantly downloading whatever apps they are to work on. If that app gets used more than a certain amount of it’s time, users can push it from the home screen menu and it will appear again in every day that has passed.
Chudnovsky said Facebook is about giving its users a more efficient experience that gets them where they want to go when they get there. He talked about this in his onstage talk at Build.
At the same time, the company continues to try to get it in front of its 1.64 billion active users, who now see 6 billion Facebook Pages each month. This is an attempt to avoid being seen as the company that’s simply pumping users into its feed, and getting them to open it more often.
One of Chudnovsky’s other jokes was that “The more users you see, the more retention you get.” App metrics show that even if most users never interact with anyone else, they spend time on the platform or in the app for an extended period of time. Those users can then open an app for the same period of time.
“The retention is really important. That’s part of a business model. If you want to talk about the longevity of a product, I would say it’s a lot of games.”
He also noted that most of Messenger’s growth has been non-technical, but clearly that growth will be based around other, more creative metrics, particularly around engagement with ads.
Back when Facebook was talking about its $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp, for example, he noted that its engagement on mobile is particularly high, with a 99 percent daily open rate."
"A new startup called Appthrift is launching today to help iOS developers bring their social apps to the iPhone, as well as to the web. The round was led by NYC-based firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, along with additional investment from RRE Ventures, Digital Garage, SV Angel, Benchmark Venture Partners, and the Appthrift team.
For those unfamiliar with Appthrift, it’s a platform that offers as many of the social app options as a builder chooses. These include things like how-to blogs, reviews and photo collages, as well as other social sharing options including games, sweepstakes and poll questions. The latter of which is how founder and CEO Kunal Shah explains

 founded a tech-based product team with founders who worked at Nokia, Microsoft, Sony, HTC, Evernote, Mozilla, and Apple. The initial team was responsible for building out the technology stack around the camera hardware, but the team has since developed it to solve a number of other problems.
The most obvious one was the need to keep the video quality high. While 4K TVs are good for content at a resolution level, video is a whole different ballgame at a volume level. What happens at that volume level? Well, you’ll hear the difference between the quality of the video and the noise, or at least be able to discern it. You can’t hear it, because the noise is distracting. And the result is a fuller feeling – something you can’t ignore when you’re viewing a video with high-def resolution or when the volume is too high.
The team was able to keep all of this running while the technology was developed, and they successfully figured out the volume effect. While I don’t see myself having much use for these kind of solutions right now, as the volume effect can’t be ignored, I still see them as the best possible solutions for TV-based video playback. And as someone who spends hours a day staring at digital media on the TV, it’s a fun little surprise to see something quite different from what’s been around for awhile."
"The world was getting ready to move onto the gold iPhones 7+, but now that we all know just what it’s really like to receive those devices you have to be excited. In case you weren’t, the iPhone 7 and 7+ are Apple’s latest iPhones-on-the-go, and are powered by the same M7 motion sensor, with an A7 chip and 2.8 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 chipset, and 2GB or 3GB of RAM.
The two devices also come with 32GB or 64GB of storage, along with the same spec-sheet for the same storage options. Inside the M7 is a 64-bit Snapdragon 615 1.9 GHz, 2GB or 3GB of RAM, and an 8MP camera.
Apple’s new iPhones are available today for $200 or $250 or $300 unlocked with cellular service included. While the $200 price-point seems reasonable, the real-deal price of the new devices is $450 or $400 at retail. For the U.S. launch, availability ends later this week."
"Smartphones have become essential accessories for a growing number of households and businesses that want to control their smart home gadgets, but they’re also making it harder for users to control their lights, locks and outlets without a physical switch. Google wants to change that with its first smart lock smart lock hardware, which is now shipping in pre-order alongside its Google Now services.
The company is launching the smart lock with a companion app that allows you to choose from custom colors to make it your personal assistant and the way you control your door, openers and locks from your phone. The product is pretty straightforward, despite what otherwise looks like a pretty simple operation.

The app lets you configure the default setting that powers the smart lock, as well as add more settings via an in-app menu. You can set the default location, and add a custom message, for example, as well as turn on or off motion sensors that can sense when someone is attempting to break in. That’s when the gadget begins shipping.

Google launched the smart lock in beta as a much-promised ‘game-changer’ to its suite of Google Now services like Google Now On Tap that relies on you getting ready to leave the house before you put in the car. Google put it front and center at its I/O developer conference this year, and the beta was widely reported as one of the best things the service yet in terms of overall usefulness and utility. The search giant’s product manager for Mountain View, Matt Langue, explained that Google thinks that the smart lock will be a key area for search queries, but it also thinks it has the potential for more useful features.

Langue told me that some of the Google team went so deep into research in order to create a smart lock that was “really, really cool” and is designed to be very personal to users. There is also a learning curve involved, and the company hopes to avoid some of the pitfalls of introducing new functionality by rolling out security first and foremost.
“We wanted to take any existing sensor we were taking existing smartphone sensors and create a smart lock that was built for users,” Langue told me. “So the sensor is a small proximity sensor, but the way that it interacts with the display and the back of the door handles and the front of the door handles and all the window “concerees

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
ade was acquired this week in a move that could help it compete better against companies like SAP, Oracle, and IBM, by tapping into a more enterprise-focused group of software-as-a-service players with greater mobility.
But that’s not to say that Microsoft bought itself too early in the game.
It’s too early to say for sure, and that’s why the company has yet to provide a complete list of services for its cloud employees. I spoke to a high-level executive who declined to speak under the conditions of anonymity, but described the company’s thinking behind its recent acquisitions.
The company has been known to make acquisitions as part of an aggressive spending spree, after first buying the company at a $1.2 billion valuation and then buying Yammer before a final round at $1.1 billion.
When Microsoft acquired Yammer, it was a clear bet that it would take the small enterprise startup and repurpose it for Microsoft purposes. That acquisition paved the way for the company to become the basis of its cloud-based enterprise efforts.
But with its more consumer-focused efforts in mind, Microsoft is now looking more at traditional enterprise software services and CRM as areas of interest to extend its power in that space.
According to the executive, the company is not yet releasing any products aimed at corporate customers to those customers yet.
It’s worth noting that Microsoft’s Surface communications is not just meant for consumers, but are a tool to expand the service for Microsoft developers working on apps for the enterprise.
“We are not targeting an enterprise use case because that is not what we are doing,” the executive said. “Most of the customers that we have are just looking for capabilities across the consumer and working with us to give them more tools in that tool box.”
So the funding, with its target not-zeroing in terms of the company’s goals, gives Microsoft a good bit of cushion for its new enterprise plans.
“We’re not really thinking about what we need to make sure we are competitive with those other players,” an employee said.
Microsoft is not releasing specific details, either, on how many customers are on the platform, or on revenue.
Microsoft said in April it expects half a billion Windows Phone apps to be generated at some point in the second year of its life. And now Microsoft is looking to take that Windows Phone growth game into the cloud with the Azure Stack."
"Apple will not be allowing a single user of third-party mail to use its iCloud Mail service, according to a report from Reuters. Developers will not be able to use iCloud Mail support, effectively turning it into a closed ecosystem, the report said, rather than allowing anyone to sign up to use the iCloud Mail service itself.
Rather, developers will be limited to third-party mail’s ability to serve as a cache for mail, per the report, which is obviously a step-up for iOS. Apple’s limitations on access point to an ongoing set of security practices surrounding its use of third-party services, and the potential for problems related to those efforts. That could result in a mix of good news and bad news, depending on what those services end up doing with the iCloud Mail userbase.
Apple has been accused of being slow to update its iOS operating system, which is often known for long-anticipated software updates, and is generally considered a user-friendly innovation. That’s generally accepted fact, but there are always people that would prefer to own and control their own hardware, and that’s generally accepted behavior.
Apple also added that developers will also be able to implement self-destructing feature functions in mail themselves, or they can build out extensions to Apple Mail, for example, which would allow users to delete a message from their inboxes.
Apple’s support for third-party developers in regards to iOS does imply some kind of limitation on the iOS APIs in use here, and that’s something we should expect to see addressed in the update‘08 update. Either way, it’ll be worth watching to see how things develop – the company has recently updated its Developer Program Policies, and added more information on third-party app support in iOS 7 earlier this month."
"With a new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launched today, some changes on battery life seem evident. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus now offer a much improved version of their battery which lasts up to 37 percent longer, according to Apple’s official announcement. This is on par with what we’ve been hearing, with the iPad Air and iPad mini both getting battery life improvements as well.
With iPhone 5, Apple had a better choice in terms of cost vs. components and design. And with the iPad 4, Apple made an optimal decision on which cellular component it includes. With

“We have very strong evidence to point to, that incremental changes, either large/small, are being measured in real-time,” he says. “We can use this as a way to measure new things, rather than just looking at metrics, and therefore a set of metrics has to be generated to quantify incremental change.”
In addition, he adds that the company will be looking to look at use-case examples such as customer segmenting, customer segmentation, and “categorised” segments —  where users have a certain sentiment or personality type in common with other consumers — to help further develop brands’ insights to help with their marketing efforts, not just in terms of where they are selling products.
The company is working with industry bodies to implement this, and Booth says it also has a commercial relationship with a large clothing retailer, currently testing an Android ‘app-based desktop’ that includes a dashboard to track trends and customer flows.
In terms of how it’s doing this, Booth says it uses a mixture of crowdsourcing and big data smarts to measure different elements of its platform and uncover what it calls the convergence of various technologies for delivering products (in addition to other user behaviour measurement tech), and that they are applying big data analytics to allow us to “real-time” understand changes to the buying habits of different segments of users of the platform.
“For example, when a customer comes to us with an item he or she likes in the fitting room, we check the fitting room usage and link to that item to help the customer get what they wanted, but we also tie an entire assortment of linked items together to help them actually buy the item when they wanted it,” he says. “In addition, we can tell the customer how they compare with their competitors — in this case goods offered by competitors which they could buy, instead of by competitors which they don’t have.”
He also says it’s about bringing together all the data they have been amassing on different types of individual users at the point-of-sale to help them deliver “more meaningful and accurate results” to their online marketing efforts, giving them “more data from the transaction to the reconciliation” — and enabling them to “re-priitize budgets for customers who buy through our platforms.”
At a time of growing competition for online shoppers, and with giants like Amazon and eBay keen to tap into the growth of mobile commerce, it’s probably a wise move by Booth to join a project that’s been brewing for a while, and maybe is a sign of how they think differently about the landscape and the future of marketing in general."
"While companies like Spotify and Deezer have made big advances in recent years in their ability to create and build a premium, music-based streaming service for smartphone users, startups in general have struggled to leverage streaming data as the major source of revenue. Startups that would make good use of this data have mostly been limited to niche services aimed at musicians or their audio-only or concert-ticketing partners. There have also been some notable exceptions, such as NYC’s Moveline, which has developed an interesting system that creates bespoke streams for different types of events, instead of using the standard sources, as with competitors. Now, music aggregators and streaming companies are increasingly addressing the needs of the everyday sports fan, as another startup called Splash is doing.
In an effort to become a broader repository for both live and on-demand music content, Splash is today launching a new iPhone application called “Surf” that lets you play music from your favorite artists while surfing the Web, social networks, blogs and more. The app offers a simple, straightforward listening and sharing experience for music found under the sun, allowing surfers to share music and follow their friends to create channels on the go.
Unlike competitors, like Beats Music, for example, which focuses on providing a basic playback experience rather than a more robust DJ-style music collection, or other startups like Discovr, which do both offer a basic music and a WAVY+DSP-style radio service, the goal with Splash is to provide an easy way to actually play and listen to music both on your phone and outside.
According to co-founder Taylor Hayward, the team has been working on Splash for a little over a year now and the launch is a big step in what the company is trying to accomplish.

“We realized that we were missing out on a revenue stream by not getting the audience,” says Hayward of its online music services. “We didn’t do the work to build the music curation community, we didn’t do the marketing work…we just focused on adding to the music community.”
Through its online platform, the startup

 campaign.

When the app is launched, customers will be able to submit and read short on-demand items created by the service, which will be linked to specific photography.
You can’t yet link some goods to a specific piece of clothing without going into a new store. But when you find something you like on the site, you can simply like it and follow your friends to follow the brand.

While this system will initially only let you follow brands on the site and maybe share to the social graph, Oustro plans to use the new funding to hire a team of dedicated buyers and community experts. It also plans to work on a mobile app, although judging by the above-display test, you won’t have access to this right now."
"The web was not meant to tell you what you wanted to do. But instead, it was just a list of top websites and links shared by the community.
Today the problem is for mobile app makers. Google has just announced that Android apps will now see their content appear in a redesigned version based on Google’s search algorithm. As a Google product manager Mike Shulman tells me, the Android app ecosystem “will start to push out changes to the OS and bring with it a level of customization you don’t see in Windows and other apps.”

Shulman noted that it’s not much used to just point at a list of the top Android app stores. It only highlights them based on what you use.
In one case, Google has put the search box at the top of the app. The Android app will “recommend” a few favorites, and a few favorites of the same. In a separate app, you can choose to follow a few app stores and see all of the differences.
What happened in the past is confusing, but hopefully clearing the interface, meaning you won’t miss the information, or simply ignoring app recommendation in more instances.
For example, say you’re browsing Facebook and want to see all updates from your friends, you can click to go right to the app store, browse the home screen, and switch over to Google Suggested Apps. The recommendation picker will show a big list. There’s also a link to a quick Google search to find apps to download.

Here’s what I said:
So the system gives a quick overview of the apps you already use. If it doesn’t have apps that you use, it will give you a list from the Google Play store. The Android app will then populate itself with some of that information using its internal database and data, and then it will pop up with a selection of the other apps.
The Android app will do something similar to Apple’s App Store. It will suggest which apps you already use, though the interface is different from Apple’s where you can choose to search for apps in a different section of the screen. You can flip through the apps by looking at other things. The Android app will also offer better navigation and help you track down apps.
 

The new Android app gives you an overview of your apps. You can see a few more details here and compare the experience of each app, including its popularity and its influence on others. For example, Facebook is listed in the top right corner with a lot of shares and is the number one app overall. Google is in the left side with a lot of shares (and a huge number of likes) and it’s the number one app overall.

One advantage is that you can now choose to “hide” apps that you don’t want appear in your Android homescreen by swiping down from the top right of the Android app instead of the Android Homescreen. It means it’ll be less jarring to users who never go to these sections. You can also create custom widgets in Android apps that display all the information you need instead of wasting time sorting through a list of apps. There’s also a developer API for apps, and it’ll help with app testing as well as further discovery on Google Play.
The app is now in the process of getting its Google Play support integrated with other Android apps. A number of iOS developers like to make sure they support a stock of Android, and vice versa, too. In the meantime, you can download Google Play here. The developer API will be launched in the next few months. Update: Google has already promised that any new Android app coming over the next few months will automatically see Android-only app support."
"Google has just published a new tool that allows users to add a voice over SMS background sound to their voiceover and instantly send voice messages.
The sounds can be integrated for a more personal, interactive, interactive version of audio-messaging. This is a major milestone for voice message apps.

 of “micro-consulting” on a one-on-one basis. As a result, there was a heightened focus on data science and algorithms and building more efficient businesses on top of a big data-driven enterprise.
And although that is intended to be the main focus, it is evident that the underlying connection is now to the app — to get this app installed on as many different kinds of machines as possible. At the same time, big data is starting to eat the enterprise, and while the focus is on the cloud today and the growth of big data, there will be more opportunities for integration with other systems and platforms to capture more of that data and return in some form (and more revenue for the enterprise).
That doesn’t mean all these data integration platforms will be part of the enterprise story, but they may very well have begun — and the market is growing in the meantime.
To be clear, the market will continue to evolve, but what the market will look like it is all about the future of data science. If you ask me, my bet is that the way that data will capture and help people design for the future will be using a mix of data sources and algorithms. But again, because we want this to be about the future of data, not perpetuating the past – that’s part of the change, in terms of just thinking about the future.

"In the early days of Facebook, most everything was a spreadsheet. Nothing more important than the business of the day, the moment someone “Liked,” or who Liked the Pages of friends, or who Liked the same Page of a friend. That was about as important.
This is all changing, of course. Today, we have more data, for example, but very little information about the people we think we know.
This shift in power was perhaps most obvious since Facebook was just four years old at the time it was formed. In that time it’s accumulated more than 1 billion users, who are now approaching 1 billion each.
And that, I think, is the crux of it for the future, says Mark Zuckerberg.
“I do feel like the world needs to really use the information that’s out there to make better decisions,” he said today in a talk at Stanford alongside discussions of Facebook’s current user base and their interactions, as reported by The Next Web.
In contrast, Facebook itself, and later Twitter, have only amassed more data, but perhaps even more data than Facebook now does.
Facebook, in fact, already has more than 1 billion users – more than some people have ever had in a single visit. But it doesn’t seem to be losing the battle for the hearts of the crowd.
Facebook’s growth plan, in which the company plans to spend the extra $10 billion to acquire users, will only help with the overall growth of the community – not necessarily users who are just “Liked” (i.e., they’ve ‘liked’ people on Facebook but don’t technically have a ‘friend’ network).
Zuckerberg suggested that Facebook could be in a better position “if we can help people make better decisions when it comes to sharing information.”
He went through the typical steps that any company would take in regards to user privacy, and then mocked up various scenarios where what he called the ‘spreadsheet’ would be even better than users actually liking or following the pages in themselves, and changing the way we use the Internet – that we don’t do right now. (This is similar to the comments of an old TechCrunch article that was called “The spreadsheet that everyone used to use as a record.”)
Facebook might not be in a great position today, however if there are more people online who have similar profiles than those for whom the site currently supports. He also suggested that if you have a profile on Facebook, “if we know you’re in a better position [for a potential hire], we want to make that better.”
Still, he said, “I don’t know the right way to balance the two scenarios.”
(The first is probably why companies that haven’t gotten to that have gravitated there.)
A second change that Zuckerberg said he supports would be to add more ‘filter’ to the information it offers users. A lot of the data Facebook has on users is relevant for someone who they’re already working with, but it may not be what someone actually wants to share with their whole network (maybe not. That’s why there is a lot of crossover between some users who enjoy both a ‘friend’ profile and an “entrepreneur’ profile.)

 North-East Bay. For example, a few blocks south is the U.S. Cellular’s “Next West Line”: 1404 Broadway, just south of downtown SF.
The West Coast portion of Bay Point will eventually comprise of three separate buildings as the city continues its downtown evolution. The buildings will each contain between 20 and 30 housing units.
There are already several startups working on similar or complementary project proposals in the Silicon Valley region, including Zillow and Spotwestbay. But these are architecture projects that are not yet built and, therefore, may not be ready yet for the masses with a rapid change in market demand as urban living becomes increasingly underserved.
There are few alternatives.
The city could continue to grow its population, which is about 35 million people today, and build additional housing units that add up to more than one million residential square feet each decade, as part of a regional strategy that includes the concept of adding or removed housing units by 2025.
The city has about $600 million in annual budget, and about $300 million in total annual taxes. This is more than $10 billion in real estate taxes in California, and more than $1 trillion in statewide income.
If the city does it could have an additional 300 housing units by 2022, more than 1 million full-time employers would already be in the city. 
For all of us who are constantly categorised the ‘middle class’ in San Francisco, more than 2 billion square feet of room for commercial and industrial space have already been created in San Francisco by cities outside of California.
What’s more, there are more than 3,000 tech-focused corporations that are living in San Francisco, and 1,000 companies profitable within San Francisco already.
It turns out that most of these corporations are more middle-class residents rather than tech ones.
One tech company’s potential employee comes from an even further below-average income in San Francisco: the average salary for the median tech-oriented San Francisco employee over the 20-year period for San Francisco was $60,000; for a similar employee in Kansas City it was $54,000.
Of this industry, only one, who does not work at a tech company, would make his or her salary more in San Francisco than Kansas on a $50,000 annual base. 
There is a reason we’ve seen a huge disparity in wages between the Bay Area and Silicon Valley. At first, there are mostly technology-oriented startups who are in the process of being born-class. But, more recently, there have been a number of mid-tier businesses popping up that are more in the Silicon Valley categorisation than in the San Francisco scene.

I think our new technology industry is really starting to wake up to the city we all know most of today and the rest of the world now, especially the cities that are truly creating a tech culture. For example, there are more tech employers than in 20 years in the tech industry, compared to the handful of employers in the 20-30-2030 timeframe in San Francisco.
In order for us to achieve a true growth strategy, we will need to educate and nurture technology industry people, especially in East San Francisco.
The biggest problem, I believe, is that there are not enough jobs. The tech industry has nearly 2 million tech employers that undercount, but only a fraction of these are still on payroll.
While the city could be doing more, it needs to do more. A majority of potential employers would be employed in San Francisco entering the tech industry; the city needs to double-track those employers across the city.
For many technology industries whose potential employers may have been born in the Bay Area, the city is truly groundbreaking in terms of how it has progressed."
"Birst, a startup that helps enterprises use existing enterprise resources to improve business performance, announced today that it has raised $100 million in Series D funding.
Investors include Accel and Insight Venture Partners — which, yes, happens to be an investor in a number of Birst others as well, and is actually a spinoff of Heliconia Capital — and

 more on the future of the company.) However, the report also notes that the company is actually developing multiple new, but still-untested products under its radar — which suggests it’s continuing to pursue products the company wouldn’t have otherwise been able to pursue.
As a reminder, PQ’s big bet is on delivering ‘click-throughs’ by leveraging the ubiquity of smartphones in order to deliver content tailored to users’ preferences, and products that do this by offering personalized, low-tech products on a monthly basis. For starters PQ has a PQ Index tool that tracks data sourced from across sources on social media, blogs and the web to track changes in users’ personalized preferences and how they’re interacting with products.
“As [we collect loads of data] on a consumer’s social accounts like social media, blogs, blogs it doesn’t really use that data in a meaningful way to suggest anything — it’s more about showing what kind of content users are looking at, what types of content they’re looking at,” CEO and co-founder Steve Simitzis explained in an interview. “The challenge in personalizing is how you can find the right content at the right time in users’ day to day streams.”
The key to doing this, Simitzis explained, is it takes a combination of “tremendous amounts of machine learning,” a powerful personalization system that can use that machine learning to create categories based on a user’s preferences, and an automated system of curating those categories and then helping that user to find products which they specifically might like based on their social media, product and lifestyle.
“This is all machine learning we’re doing. We’re collecting tons of data on users and integrating it with, and synthesizing it into categories based on preferences,” Simitzis explained. “We find those unique categories and then combine that with the content that we’re pulling out, and combine it with those unique points across the spectrum we’re edging so we can offer that content to users at the right time and in the right way.”
PQ and the other marketers are hoping that this data will help craft recommendations which users can then open up based on the items they like, Simitzis said.

This is a major challenge for PQ, as it will be able to scale up to all sorts of products, and there is no reason why it couldn’t offer similar sets of recommendations across products, regardless of how similar they may be, based on their own data sets. But what makes PQ interesting is it has decided to limit the products and sets of data it does and then serve up PQ for its customers based on what its users are sharing, what items are actually saying about things, and what sorts of content is popular amongst those users.
PQ is able to offer that data to its small customer base, Simitzis said, and beyond that, it can track what kinds of products are being used by users, and then share that data across its network to provide better recommendations. “It’s not something you can do at scale,” he said, “but we’re definitely doing it at a level where the data is big enough for our clients to get really good insights,” he explained. And it is scalable.
PQ is about to announce its $3 million seed round, which Simitzis describes as “a seed round in the billions,” following the funding of a previous seed round which Simitzis says closed at the end of July.
PQ was founded in 2013, but is only now taking in a few large checks, mainly from its venture investor Benchmark, and its five-person team, which includes co-founder/CTO Danny Phelan, who was CEO of GoDaddy and former CTO at Veritas. Among its investors are the CFO of Yahoo Tom Preston-Werner, who came to the firm with a number of companies previously with lots of experience in the mobile payments, cloud computing and payments spaces.
Simitzis says that PQ is also currently looking to announce a number of new products and partnerships that it’s still tweaking out, so stay tuned."
"As we saw on Tuesday, Microsoft did indeed launch a Windows 10 preview on Tuesday. The operating system was also set to get mobile later this year.
Microsoft announced a preview for the operating system, saying that it was coming to Windows 10 “soon.” The focus of previewing was on a technical preview of the operating system.
So what was new? A lot of new code, yes, but the company also wanted to make sure that the preview users could test their applications on a technical preview

 probably a year off.”
As a result, she says that this is just the beginning. In the future, the company is looking to introduce an on-demand feature which will enable users to order food directly from the app’s servers. Meanwhile, it will also launch a marketplace similar to Foodspotting, enabling users to buy or sell pre-order tickets using their location. It would then go after revenue from these different sales.
To do that, the company plans to grow its team of 15. In the meantime, you can find Foodspotting here, and from there you can find the TechCrunch article on Foodspotting’s founding team here."
"It seems that for all the hype generated around the potential of wearables, smartwatches seem like a long distance dream after all — not that this would stop the average person from buying a Fitbit or a fancy-new wrist-mounted display from Apple or Samsung — but in the end, it’s not hard to dream of something entirely different, and a new device called the Ego from Italy.
It’s not really a gadget in its own right, just a tool for manipulating your information with the help of an Internet-connected app. In fact, just like an editor with a piece of paper on what they did next to help you in work a hundred years ago, Ego wants to be that. At CES this year, the company announced that they’re shipping its first wearable for real. The device is called the Ego Life, and is a collaboration in the Italian-US-TUREO with the Italian Navy.
I’ve been given the opportunity to spend a bit longer with the device and really like it, and I was really not. In fact, it wasn’t until during my trip I met with company founder Paolo Dalià, that I realized there really wasn’t much to say about this device. My only complaint is that it’s not a product my fellow editors really enjoy using — and there are a few things that I don’t like it.
As it stands now, Ego has the product itself, in a limited edition of 400 devices, but when it comes to the software and app, it’s a far cry from the products from other OEMs are releasing in many of the same circles. When the device is taken off, you could say the product will only look like it’s an actual watch – a completely different device than the one built by Apple, I’d say.
Ultimately, we’re more at the early game in terms of being able to see the future than actually knowing what we’ll do with it. Apple has yet to put the time and energy into a complete, fully redesigned iOS 9, and even when it has, the iPhone has generally been one of the better-known products available that isn’t quite there yet. In a way, we’ll be one to witness how the Apple Watch evolves over time and it’s here that Ego’s partnership with Paolo could start to play a critical role in helping it meet this goal.
In the meantime, you can find the Ego on Kickstarter here."
"Google has just quietly pushed out one updated version of its Motorola OnDroid program to its popular Google+ application, Google Play. That means one more hardware, as well as a set of new features and a slight re-design (to help the phone stand out from all the rest).
The OnDroid One — or ‘OnDroid One 2 — is the most recent update on the phone’s Android side. The update brings Android Lollipop into the OnDroid software, along with a couple of improvements and some balance-tested tweaks (thanks to Android Nougat), but it also adds a pretty much-small, lightweight piece of hardware that may be the new Google hardware.
Google’s latest hardware is a huge leap ahead of what was already available out of the box on the phone. Onboard is a fully-equipped device, that packs what the industry is expecting in terms of a 2080 x 1800 processor with 4GB of RAM on board, a 5.8-inch IPS display, a slightly larger 5 megapixel rear camera with a 5-megapixel front-facing shooter, and a 3,000 mAh battery (or 1,003 mAh, if you don’t care about the extra size). That’s roughly equivalent to what Apple added in iOS 9 without any major alteration, and at $499.99 for the first 2060 unit.

The handset is slightly thinner and lighter (at just 26mm wide) than what we saw for the first OnDroid device, and it’s a bit much lighter and lighter than the one we reviewed. That’s probably by just a bit more than the average person

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 since the last two-plus years have seen a major push in the number of startups focused on creating hubs that connect individuals and businesses across their social and personal networks.
At the same time, we’ve begun to see some emerging hubs where startups have converged, even as they continue to raise their own fundraising. There are, thankfully, a lot of hubs that have emerged as a result of the startup’s network-building strategies, where you will find a fair number of them clustered in clusters, and they share common investor and other audiences, as well as common business interests — with the three-dimensional variety of what you find in a hub can be both humbling and exciting.
In a way, the hubs that are emerging are similar to the ones that we’ve already seen emerging from our hubs in San Francisco and New York, specifically around business services. The difference, of course, is that these hubs are starting to converge around a specific model and model of service — either vertical — which makes it difficult to determine where they are collectively located on an app, a website or from a specific hub.
When you think about it, the network is the engine that enables the services that we have today; the networks between people that want to make decisions around products, services and their business. The “hub” in the Hub concept is shorthand for its many, many members of a tribe.
The hubs we’re creating today are no exception. Every single one of them carries that same information to help move important information, connect connections and make decisions — whether it’s a hotel in Chile to help figure out which hotel to share with which buyer or how does a local merchant scale?
If you want to build a simple, inexpensive, high-quality service — even a one that is not marketed to any specific vertical — that needs high quality vetting, you may have to start with a destination hub. And to be honest, what’s most exciting about the Hub concept is how many of the Hub hubs we’ve been seeing emerge in recent years (which have collectively pulled in tens of millions in dollars in funding) are creating prototypes and other prototypes from the ground-up, rather than the prototypes of other verticals. And these prototypes tend to start small and not necessarily scale vertically, to focus on certain segments of service, but it’s more than worth it to start with, as the community matures and becomes more active.
But, to be fair, what we have seen over the last five or so years is a steady rise in the number of new hubs that have emerged, the number of innovative hubs and the number of local data sets that have compiled, as the people involved become more interested in these “hub” concepts. And, as a result of this growth, we’re now starting to see some pretty big changes in the Hub concept that are being experienced at the moment. There are some fairly obvious differences that make the experience of a hub more or less the same as it would have been in the past: If the Hubs are still essentially free, there are still people waiting, and if they choose to work on a specific aspect of the Hub, then they probably won’t be working on it again the next day; or if they have already made an informed decision about what type of Hub to use (let’s just call “Hubs” Hubs).
And while Hubhub’s early access to limited partners was exciting initially, it’s also perhaps an indication of Hubhub’s growing maturity as a Hubspot/Privateer, and the growing demand from its members to expand the number and range of its Hubs, as they become better able to track and manage their workflows more successfully."
"It’s been said that the most successful startups are born from the ideal needs of the person who is going to be receiving their data. So it should be no surprise, then, to learn that the second-largest group of successful startups is the people who are data-sensitive and always seeking the knowledge they need to make an impact change. If it sounds like the stereotypical entrepreneur, you would be right.
Data-sensitive innovators are often incredibly passionate. They have obsessive insights about what problem, issue and what solution is the right way to solve the data problems of their customers, their users and those they care about. They want to find a way to solve a problem or provide an alternative to the existing ways of doing business. They want to find ways to automate what should have normally required human analysis. They are motivated by problems of data-driven businesses that require highly technical talent to solve problems of gathering, analyzing, storing, packaging and analyzing data about customers, clients and prospects.
What many of the companies in our profile include are the technical, data science, analytics, workflow, predictive, visualization and workflow elements. In addition, the founders and staff of these companies share a common social

"Drones have a few nagging problems when it comes to dealing with the increased noise. The latest solution that aims to address this issue is the newly released BISAR Drone. Designed for outdoor enthusiasts that want to get their drone ready for whatever day has come, BISAR aims to allow you to quickly take action from the skies without sacrificing the convenience of home security that so many have used for so long.
The UDA-created bISAR can stand for “Personal Sensory System for the Drone” and consists of a large transmitter that plugs into the drone’s USB port, a battery life that can be anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes, and a wireless accessory that should allow the drone to talk freely to a smartphone.
To use the bISAR system, you simply have to install a compatible payload, which is a small microprocessor and camera. Once the drone is equipped with the bISAR app on your phone, any connected device that runs the bISAR app will allow the device to operate right from the drone. That means you can remotely control the drone, too, using an accelerometer in a separately installed port.
The system takes advantage of wireless power technology to power up the drones, as well as supporting passive application charging using a magnetic port. Battery life is also very impressive – the remote is said to be up to 20 percent of a drone’s maximum capacity, while the transmitter is estimated to reach 80 percent of its maximum throughput while still under active usage.
BISAR isn’t the first device designed to deal with issues associated with UAVs and other airborne systems, of course. We’ve seen similar remote electronics from companies like Navit and SkyMount, for instance. But Navit is much more focused on UAVs, while SkyMount is more of a standalone solution for DAS devices.
Drones are still an effective means for addressing the problem of drones-as-a-service. These are also very small machines – the sort of things you could easily carry in as a portable electronics device and carry around at home. However, while this may change over time, it’s something Amazon has been exploring as a possible replacement for its larger and more expensive UAVs. Adding this kind of capability to self-contained UAVs and more generally any kind of hardware device with UAVs – even just for cameras is a big step forward.

"A new wave of startups working to solve the growing problem of long commute home from a city center – or that and the accompanying challenge of data-driven decision making – have emerged, with more and more startups popping up on the continent in 2013.
At the same time, in August, European regulators blocked a €3 billion deal to acquire a European internet giant, Aol, last year because it couldn’t get compliance procedures and did not meet the required EU company standards.
Now a group of seven UK/U.S. startups, based in London, are making an attempt to tackle the commuting problem with the launch, by themselves, of Shigeworks, a “peer powered” city guide where commuters can plan their journeys, share real-time traffic data and track other data on Shigets.co.uk.
The first version of the mobile app debuted this week, with a basic map, and the promise features, along with the promise of better route alignment, with others adding features that go beyond just mapping. There is also a new report, called Shigeworks Roadmap, written by professional mapping experts, which will tell you where public transport network stops are, what streets are being used, and what buildings are being vacated.
The report will also highlight any changes that have been placed to accommodate public transport’s current layout or shape, which is of course endlessly debated. But the current situation for many would be extremely complicated to navigate.
“If the government, local authorities and transport companies didn’t take more of the lead, the problem might end up being most customers and communities, not commuters,” says founder-centric Mosaic

 a bit of handwringing over who is the guest and what they can and can’t do. It’s clear these are some folks that care more than just putting a few ideas out there and getting the results. When you think about it, that’s good for the ecosystem and we think they’re very worthwhile.”

The company has just closed $2 million in seed funding led by First Round Capital and SV Angel. It’s now raised $3 million in venture funding. I personally thought they could make it through without any investments, but they did raise a bit of angel funding. But in what can only be called a coup of sorts by Google, they actually managed to do it without an initial investment. They do take advantage of their own size in a way you can’t find most companies do — Google and its friends.
Their model is to build products for early adopters who are then able to iterate with them. Google can do that effectively with the cloud in search, but these early users have to be patient. The network does get slow, but they have a huge cache with their customers, so they can push out new applications and apps that get pushed to customers faster. So the longer they hold out, and the more likely they’ll be opening up new apps and services, the better the chance the product will be able to attract new customers for Google.
As a part of this fund, Sachin Mandel and Rohit Vashisht, will be joining the board of directors of any company that exits or helps start up out there. Mandel, who was formerly the CTO of SearchEngine Capital and VP of Search Products, is the founder of Peer.com and was most recently VP of Corporate Development for a client list that included Yahoo in particular. He’ll be joined by Vashisht, who was formerly VP of Corporate Marketing at Yahoo, and has held roles at Salesforce, Google, Amazon and elsewhere.
If you think all of this sounds exciting, why should you care?
If Google’s strategy pans out, it’ll have a large impact not only for the entire internet ecosystem, but for the nascent ecosystem just generally. If something gets built, you’d probably use it now to build something for yourself, and Google gets an equity stake so they don’t have to do that themselves any more, because there’s a lot more software and infrastructure to be created.
The internet itself is an incredible system, and as we see better and more of our devices connected, indexed and searchable, the system will really take off, but also the individual experience will suffer.
When Google says that the world could be “more efficient, easier to manage and affordable,” this is often a reference not just to our own computers, or our phones, but also our cars and our connected homes. The internet is a great network, but often we are simply accessing the internet and getting a service in return. And even though the internet is increasingly constricted, we still manage access.
This is just the beginning. Our connected devices are continuously getting more powerful. Even when you think about the future of wireless communication (which I think it means that, say the future of wireless phone calls), Google has a plan to extend that to every device.
There’s a reason why Google cares; they know that the internet is not only a great platform for apps and content, but also for rich content that can be richly enriched using web standards that take advantage of these platforms.
If the Internet was just your friend-meets-family system, it might even be better. We’re just getting there. The whole web is a big data project. Google is interested using their raw data to do more and better, to find the best nooks and crannies into data, to allow access for their users and even for their own data.
This is an opportunity for Google. I don’t mean Google. If you“get the internet, what do you do with it?”, that’s where Google is. Google understands that the internet is not just content, it’s a platform that contains rich distribution channels.
When you talk about Google’s vision in the next twenty years of the internet, you’ll say that I think that we’re going to do a lot of things. When you talk about what’s a platform, that’s what they’re talking about. When you talk about what’s a platform and what’s a platform for something else, that’s what Google is doing. Google wants to own the world. That’s what they have all your data for, and for the rest you can go do it yourselves.
If you’re interested in Google’s long term, this is just

 in your favorite places to find things to do on a given weekend.

The idea to personalize your local listings is not entirely new. A number of startups have tried to help users tap into Facebook’s social graph in order to find things to do nearby, but Zillow’s local listings feature is much more comprehensive. For example, a search for San Francisco’s AT&T and its own neighborhood brings up a variety of results from local news sites, blogs and forums.
It’s also important for LocalMavens to be able to offer tools for local event discovery – that is, if the idea is to eventually aggregate all your local friends’ recommendations as Zillow did for homebuying activity, not one person’s opinion is at a time. Of course, when the company does reach its “personalize” in the form of personalized results, it will also allow users to do that. You can imagine being offered other ways to search for a given event or activity, like “sick bar you’re in,” “coffee that’s good” or “great club for your favorite charity.”
For more information about LocalMavens, check out the blog post or text of its website."
"Social dating giant Bustle is releasing a fairly interesting tidbit. The company has just appointed people from Twitter to its board of directors.
It’s actually no surprise that Twitter was Bustle’s first choice when it landed on the board, given that its founder Adam Buch would be the executive chairman of the company. I suppose the only really interesting thing about this appointment is that this brings Bustle-a-hol, the company that wants to disrupt the online dating space. It’s no surprise to see a founder make the jump on board.
Cindy Chamberlain, who’s joining Bustle’s board as of September, was previously a VP and general counsel at Google. He was also COO at Slice, an iPhone shopping startup. Since October, Chamberlain has been a board member at Zappos.
“I’m really excited about being able to have Jared Leto… who was saying hello from everywhere in the app universe,” Chamberlain said via email. “As CEO of Bustle and an advisor to several and well known companies (Battling Point, Shyp and Uber/Uber Home) I love it that @jordan [Mayfield] and @jordan [Mayfield] can help us get to the product.”
Bitt’s full hire report starts with his first job at Twitter, working for the company’s executive management team on the product team. It’s clear that he wants to expand his social media experience, given his extensive experience in the business.
Bitt also mentions publicly about the time he spent as VP of Marketing at Twitter and its role in his decision to move to a venture capitalist role in the past three years.
Of course, this isn’t his first rodeo. The CEO was also an investor in Twitter, where he was joined by Sean Parker (VP of advertising), Ari Stein (Director of Engineering), Michael Seidens (Chief Analytics Officer) and Adam D’angelo.
Battling point? Well, if you do try to get the scoop on a startup during the company’s board meeting, be prepared to get some pretty solid information. Twitter is far from an unfamiliar name to some.
Somewhat recently, it’s gotten into the social commerce space with the launch of a new feature called “The Journey Home” that allows users to take their favorite tweets and share the “story” behind them like a tweet ad.
This is yet another attempt to connect the company into the e-commerce ecosystem. Facebook famously owns Instagram and is a major competitor to Bustle (and, to a lesser extent Facebook). It’s a smart move for Twitter to be working to connect with brands in the same way it does to get on the site itself. I’m sure we can expect more acquisitions like this one."
"This year at the SXSW festival of music, tech and pop, Spotify beat Twitter by the time it took the stage last night thanks to social media. As a result, the music streaming service will be “Singing A Song For You” tomorrow at the event.
The idea is simple: In case you haven’t heard of SoundCloud, the service allows anyone to make music videos of songs they’re currently listening to, as well as those from an artist on the platform. Once you’ve picked an artist, you can share the video on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram (via your SoundCloud listener) to your friends, and everyone else at the crowd will be sipping a

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
Machur and he plans to launch the first product at the end of October."
"You might not think a company can launch and be in the black (or on-the-ground zero) quite so quickly, let alone try to climb the charts on top of that. That’s why we’re excited to be joining John Biggs, Jordan Crook and John Biggs and Shanna Brown at Disrupt SF 2014. It may not be the last startup we work with that goes this route.
In case you aren’t into business software and/or the interminable, but it’s important to understand that we’re an audience of judges — men and women — who we welcome to Disrupt.
Our startup, RocketSpace, is a shared workspace to let members work out of the same space. We’ve had a lot of the same tech-savvy founders, who are also keen to build these shared spaces, and we also have a few interesting startup founders: Breezy, a mobile collaboration company; and Spare. In every category, there’s an ecosystem of unique startups.
So, as a TechCrunch Disrupt finalist, our pitch will be that startups should lean on the crowd of judges to guide them to what might be the next big thing. (We’ll be more specific about our approach over the coming weeks.)
We’ll be focusing specifically on companies that are building services on-demand: so, rather than think the future, we have to bet that young folks and the young people we hire in the future will think the future.
That’s exactly what we’re going to focus on working with John Biggs and Shanna Brown.
Both of their companies have had quite successful exits already: TastingTable acquired Zandora in 2011 for a reported $200 million and is now valued at about $2 billion. At Rocket Space, they’ve also raised a total of $2.2 million for the companies, and in one of their most recent seed rounds, they raised a $250K round in August. The previous venture they raised, a $1.5 million convertible note, comes from Bessemer Venture Partners.
Breezy co-founders Brett Crosby and Scott McNealy say the company has two different business models, which they’re completely comfortable with and which they hope will continue, as a result.
“We don’t try to sell the idea of service providers and get them off the ground. We do that from that point on,” says Crosby. “We were early on this idea of the sharing economy.” He says, the sharing economy is an easy way, because they realize that people care more about the products that they use, and their process doesn’t involve the full service team.
For now, the focus for Breezy and Shanna is around both the software-based and the on-demand business.
Both Breezy and Shanna Brown are working on an initiative called Project Dovetail (which is currently live in beta), where they wanted to create and develop tools to help make it much easier for companies to share and provide their service, among the many other companies out there who are trying to get in on the on-demand business. But, as one of their early seed investors said in an email:
The company is also launching a new product today to help businesses, either on the Web or in apps, create and customize their personalized profiles. The product, called Profile Sync, is powered by Zendesk, and integrates with a company’s Google Analytics, to help it populate its database.
Breezy Founder and CTO Brett Crosby has quite a bit of experience in building and building cloud-based apps (check that out even in case you weren’t sure, in fact, check that out at this time) before, as he was one of the founding engineers behind Mulesoft, which sold to Yahoo in 2006 (he went on to create and run Mulesoft at a huge time for Yahoo). While that might help him as a technologist, it could also mean that he’s one of the most long-term visionaries of technology as an industry, which could (they hope) help him with his broader vision for the world of tech.
“I want my profile on TechCrunch to be a resource I use to keep up with my work and my life,” says Crosby."
"Today at Disrupt SF, Twitter’s CEO Dick Costolo discussed the future of the tech: Noisy, but useful. The CEO referenced President Obama’s statement this past June, which signaled a change in the leadership of the company. He said that without constant change, disruptive innovation would simply go out the window. “Twitter is no longer a company that wants to change,” he said.

 and not the first to launch, and it’s an exciting new way to build a company from scratch around mobile, which is something most founders are keen to do.
There’s also the promise of expanding the types of applications and services that can be built around the app — and the potential to offer services similar to those already offered by big players like Facebook.
The company is today disclosing $1.5 million of seed funding led by First Round Capital."
"Triblio, the social network for people living in non-English speaking countries, announced today that it has raised $2 million in funding for its platform that is currently in Beta.
Triblio’s goal is “to use technology to solve the complexity of local social spheres” which include friends, family and co-workers. It offers a platform on which people can create groups to connect and collaborate with others who speak Spanish or French or Korean, and can share media, and eventually build their profiles on Triblio. And unlike Facebook, when users log in, they enter in a few text details, allowing Triblio to subsequently match them with people who share their interests.
Triblio was founded at the beginning of 2013 by Raúl Alfaro Valar and Xavier Almunia, who both work in technology and entrepreneurship in their native Spain, in their early twenties and threes. The two initially created a mobile social network for people in their twenties, called YoungTribe, but quickly realized that that people liked to read about different opinions, and the team quickly learned that these opinions differed from the same person, so they pivoted into Triblio, which is today still in beta.
Why? Well, for starters, and this is what makes Triblio interesting, it has a nice bit of gamification in the sense that your followers, friends and co-workers can help decide whether your items are a hit or a miss. Also, the more you post on your item, the more “interesting” you are. Your item is “out of the ordinary,” although your friends can see the things you post, which means the item is trending on a map of users, and the item also has a “deal.” (Oh, and this can also be shared on Twitter and Facebook, of course.)
Triblio users have posted over 200,000 items in 1,500 collections since launch, and the vast majority of their creations are from third-world countries. I asked Trajula whether he thought they’d likely to create collections for other ethnic groups, and he had this to say: “In terms of target audience for this there’s no big opportunity aside from Asia, I think the product category would be very popular in Europe and Asia-aligned countries, and I think the US is likely to increase in the coming weeks and years. But we’re not going to focus on the ‘U.S. market.’”
He also says they’d like to add social-app capabilities to their product, in the future, as well, and to expand internationally. For example, you can now follow and like items from a specific area of interest.
You can reach Trajula at at his home here. And if you want to see some tech talk, you can reach him on Twisted, which is in the current top 10.
"
"Mobile ad startup Drawbridge is announcing that it has raised $1.9 million in funding.
Drawbridge says the funding includes the following: investors in the round include Layoffs Capital, CrunchFund (Crunch co-founder Mike Arrington’s) and Matthew Pappajohn, WPP Managing partner David Bessey, JFJ Venture Manager Alex Moore, and the firm’s ad unit, Drawbridge Innovators.
Now, I must say, congrats, Drawbridge’s founders have knocked this story out of the park here on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage – in other words, they figured it out pretty quickly. (Pappajohn told me that being featured in the app store here means Drawbridge “gets tons of traffic,” and that while “a lot of users will download your app,” they’ll still want to try it, and “they’re going to remember to use it.”) Founder and CEO Geoff McQueen also told me that he thinks the Drawbridge product, the social side of the app, and the app’s overall concept will resonate with users who are now more accustomed to browsing on social networks and viewing ad-laden website ads. (Drawbridge says its users spend 100 minutes per day on the app, and that many users return to the app after their first use – for example, 40% of users who first try the app will convert to users who stay with the app after it completes these first uses.)"

 their acquisition, though the company does not reveal the terms of the deal. Though he adds that the transaction was for cash, not stock, he notes that the deal also included “a small percentage” of StockTwits’ staff as well, who will now join StockTwits. (In other words, it doesn’t have any equity in StockTwits.)
The deal also makes StockTwits the company the latest big company in the company’s Token Hub machining program, which also included trading of the long-legged’s in the year-ago version of the “faucet” and other merchants.
For those unfamiliar, Token Hub, a new program from the likes of Visa, MasterCard and AmEx, aims to help small business owners, or any other small business without much merchandise, make better payments through PayPal. The company says over 8 million merchants are supported across more than 1,300 member banks and card networks.
This is what the acquisition of StockTwits brings to its own. “StockTwits has been a standout company helping millions of small businesses and individuals. We’re excited to be joining StockTwits’s team of experts and merchants,” says CEO and founder Lindsay Lohan. “The team has built a talented team, making them one of the best leaders in cross merchant mobile payments and PayPal escrow services.”
Lohan tells TechCrunch that these two companies were already working well together prior to StockTwits, which was just entering beta. “They’ll be joining StockTwits’ global PayPal escrow solutions team that’s based in San Francisco and committed to growing the position of their company’s products and making it easy for consumers and startups to securely pay merchants. For StockTwits it adds a huge amount of value since they offer escrow and settlement services to our customers, offering a quick and trusted and high-quality alternative to a struggling storefront and associated businesses.”
To be clear, this is not StockTwits’ first acquisition. Lohan says that the company already has a large number of customers using its mobile payments products, “over 100,000 having made direct payments using its network of mobile apps” and a large number of merchants, including five of the top ten on the Lister site in the U.S., who work with the company.
The company has been profitable since Q2 2012, and has grown its revenue every year since. However, that has been a slower time than Lohan would have hoped, he says. “I look forward to this opportunity to help StockTwits reach profitability and grow even faster. I’m very excited to bring StockTwits’ scalable mobile platform innovation and broad product offering to the StockTwits service set.”"
"The new startup accelerator The Kernel Group is offering a platform to help developers with their deployments on-the-fly.
In a post about The Kernel’s latest class, co-founder Greg Cohn, an entrepreneur and investor with over 20 years of experience, showed me a web page that shows a chart of the most popular apps in the Docker ecosystem at any given moment, along with details about the apps’ usage and usage, and shows how the number of containers there are is growing. If it sounds a little overwhelming, COO Mark Collier wrote in a blog post that Docker is still a young ecosystem, and while some containers are good at handling the workloads, some of them are unable to handle the load.
“The kernel and all of its products represent a very diverse ecosystem,” Collier wrote.
The Kernel Group has now launched The Kernel Social Cloud. It will be offered as an SaaS provider for teams that want to set up their own private Docker containers. It will offer an automated docker daemon that can run when a team member wants to move their container, or they can set something simpler which is more like a shell and only requires very little work.
The first group of users to take advantage of The Kernel Social Cloud is a group of three junior engineering students at the University of Miami and Rice University, Collier told me. One of them, James Tamplin, is already using the service while serving as an instructor at the university. Collier writes that it’s a little like a private version of Docker that isn’t limited to the college campus environment. You can see a video of the platform here and read more about the plans for the broader release in a few weeks.
As a company, it’s interesting to watch this sort of effort from Collier, who had the good credit. Before starting that company in-house, he worked at a large consulting firm that is also trying to move to the open source model and is trying to make a career out of the Docker environment. To do

 in the process, for instance, and if it goes well, the idea will be replicated elsewhere.
“While companies like Apple and Google are building out platforms and applications for these connected devices, it’s just the potential application of deep linking that gives the internet the power to add new sensors and information to it without requiring a lot of work to do,” notes Zynga’s lead researcher, Manu Kumar.
The new application is due out in about a month or two after it’s deployed. In fact, the company also just launched its own developer site for the new Android version in place of the beta build that was previously being tested with select testers in the tech industry’s beta group.
The potential for the platform is much more extensive than a simple user interface tweak, however. The idea, explains Kakum, is to be able to include the features developers want – including things like tracking usage/shipping time, resource use and more –  but as a secondary feature, the app will allow those in the customer experience team use to make better decisions. As one user feedback point out in our conversation, it’s often the case that a better mobile experience is the reason for which a mobile search experience would be included. (To make room for those ideas, you can imagine some of the team’s more sophisticated users being involved in the “why”.)
“I can imagine the impact on mobile is huge if [we] include those tools,” he says.
Kakum declined to identify the company’s investors, other than the fact they were large enough that they could provide financial support to the developer community. These customers include CarryQuest, which helps developers add wearable devices to their devices, the EyeEm team (which has cracked a way to build personalized filters in photo apps, such as the ones that appear in Instagram’s gallery), and Trim.io, the startup whose filter-setting tools are now used in the Yahoo News app."
"Mobile analytics firm Flurry was awarded one of the most favorable terms of exchange ratio for a first day public offering on Wednesday. Flurry’s first day was a hit, with the company posting an IPO price that was $7.02, a number that was three times the previous IPO price to give you an idea of how far things have to go when it comes to private company value as measured in the Private Market. The result: a lot of money. And, not a bad thing, for the company.
The company is currently valued at $1.2 billion, and while a healthy IPO price might sound like “frighteningly rich people are betting against,” its a bit less rich, especially on the road to a billion-dollar market valuation, as it was yesterday in an SEC filing. The private company will present its stock on the NASDAQ under the symbol “FLUD.” As I wrote the same week, the market (which is the secondary market for private company shares) seems to prefer a more private atmosphere to the more open-ended public market.
So, the company is trading at a premium today against the IPO price. This could indicate that private valuations are a bit out of whack since the IPO price was a bit ahead of what private companies are seeing right now. However, while it’s the first day of public trading for the company, it doesn’t necessarily mean the company will be able to climb as high as it’s going to have to go from this point. There is always the chance of a company going public sometime in the next year or two."
"It’s the day for public voting. The company you’ve hired as your employee, or hired as a part of your startup proposal, a board member or potential investor has the last say in whether your company is going to be around for a significant portion of time. You can look for an update on these matters soon, or make them public during the open-session session at which the meeting will take place. And, most importantly, the vote is a good thing.
You have a full list of the attendees on hand, from people like VCs and lawyers to non-profit leaders and business people. As a result, there are only a handful of qualified persons, and even then a lot of noise and confusion can be found. Of course, this is less than the level of transparency a well-qualified outsider would be looking to have on hand in the room.
You don’t even have the usual list of who will vote at the meeting. A person or company that is getting a public vote for a CEO or founder must be invited, meaning they must have a current employee, a CEO candidate or employee candidate with immediate authority.
For non-profit entities (

 faces on the screen is, of course, a far bigger challenge.
To make the problem at least worth mentioning, the company says it is currently receiving around 30,000 alerts per week, and is tracking more than 2.5 million devices. The app is currently live in more than 200 countries.
This also looks like it’s a much wider opportunity for Duedil than it first appears, as the French company was first developed in Paris, and later expanded to other French cities, such as Bordeaux, Nantes and Toulouse.
Update: Commenting on Duedil‘s growth on Reddit, the company told me: “The company is only 2 years old and has built a product that was ready for this market. This is why we found the perfect team who, despite his experience, were already at the company. Now we want to accelerate its growth by moving to afreq.”"
"This week, the TC team took a break from our regularly focused on consumer tech to dive deep into mobile. Our first Mobile Podcast is focused on a single application called Poke that lets Android users chat with their friends without requiring a fully installed app.
We first had heard from the company in March, and have since seen its app go on app store charts almost overnight, all fueled by what we’re starting to find we like on Android.
That said, the company hasn’t shied away from the consumer space, with a revamped Android version of its app that includes the now fully-integrated Facebook Chat, instant notification support, an Android-focused Flipboard-like magazine for Android notifications, as well as an Android Wear app for tracking your fitness, and more.
You can grab the Android version of Poke here."
"Snapchat is in the news for a couple of reasons. First, the company shares a name with the infamous group, “My name.” It allows people to make short, silly videos together.
But more importantly, the app has grown into a cultural phenomenon that includes taking a song and dance party celebrating love, which now has a few venues.
Second, Snapchat is now the number one free app in the App Store, after becoming the number one free app for many months. At the same time, many users have started to take the app seriously, and it’s now considered to be the best way to discover the latest content that is flowing along the app.
Third, Snapchat has become one of the go-to hangouts, as people flock to various night clubs around the city. It’s not surprising that the scene has caught the attention of tech giants, as it has been home to the most recent discussion about the future of a very specific industry.
For those interested in a little history and history, and a fun look at why TechCrunch’s Colin Estone is so ticked off about the app:
“So I wonder if our generation lacks a natural talent for innovation” Estone says about the group’s early and fast growth. “They seem to have more ideas than they’d have on Day One, like the Oculus crowd.” Of course, as Estone points out, the “first of all” of them is the reason behind all the creativity; of course, not all the ideas work.
It goes back to the app’s earliest days. In the early days, the company wanted to create a messaging experience inside an app, just as the “chatroulette” inside WhatsApp was called. But these early days seemed like a great time for it to make a splash; but as it began attracting real mainstream users, it seemed to lose its initial appeal. In the months after the app’s launch, the company went after other categories, including video, adding music, and even sports.
However, as the “chatroulette” model became popular, the founders found themselves lacking a certain virality, so they’d turn to advertising. It was around this time that they’d meet Evan Spiegel and Andrew Jennings, and realize their vision for a new type of text chat.
Spiegel describes his earliest days as a photographer, with a hobbyist arm for crowd-sourced photography, and later experimenting with a mechanical camera. Jennings has a diploma in film photography from Santa Barbara Community College, and Spiegel traces his first steps onto his father’s car in the garage, when he was introduced to the new mechanics.
Spiegel says the idea first came to him “just as I was going to give up work” by the time he left school.
The idea for SnapChat came to them right after they returned to New York from San Francisco. They wanted something that would enable them to meet like-minded individuals who were interested in the same things they wanted to do – including traveling.
Soon, they realized that friends who were on vacation around

’s just now launched to the rest of its user base, including those at enterprises.
The app is similar to some, but takes advantage of a trend that’s been popular around enterprise apps in that you use them to manage tasks, and it also offers a graph-backed view of who has been using it as well as its “people” with information around the task in question. The system pulls information from LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and, in the future, Google for Web, Weather, Mail, Sales and other communications. 

Once you start creating accounts, you can tie all of your activity to jobs using a “job board,” allowing you to set the specific category that you’re looking for. For example, you could create the company website as a category for a business. The application can be used to create multiple apps, including a task list, a document sharing button, a text-based note and more.

The app also offers other analytics and a search box. It will present you a search of your top contacts based on things like your most recent work and home jobs, the activity surrounding your projects (from the folks on Hacker News), plus and more. (You can set an “interest graph” there, too.)

On the side, you can manage your own tasks. You can, for example, create a task from an “@Work” (a customizable address book option). After setting up the app, your incoming invites are automatically sent to you automatically and you are alerted via email alerts when additional invitations are sent.
As part of the company’s larger product, a company manager can manage multiple company accounts with one interface.

The company is also announcing that it has received $250,000 in angel funding led by New York angel investors David Dufresne and David Tisch.
Update: I should have clarified that I am not the only Googler that is getting an invite, but also a woman in the tech industry. I contacted the company’s CEO and co-founder Kristin Goyette, who told me, “I am not just a random person getting invites, I am a tech company manager who has subscribed for years to help grow the business.”
The company says its mobile app has been downloaded 1.5 million times and that 70 percent of the site’s current site visitors access it on their smartphones. It has also received a lot of positive responses to the website, with a 4.5 out out 4.3 star rating in the past week.
For now, Googler is focused on hiring product and UX developers to work on “building a better search, deep learning and natural language processing engine,” says Goyette. It will also open a London office in June."
"Twitter announced it would be suspending an investigation into the company on Thursday, May 19, related to a breach of the Terms of Service in question.
The news of the suspension comes just one day after it emerged that Twitter had another massive, systemic security breach, exposing 200 million private API keys that were used to access a large amount of internal Twitter and employee Twitter accounts. The company was able to recover from the intrusion about two days ago.
At the time of the breach in question, Twitter CEO Dick Costolo was pointing the finger of blame at companies in the U.S. for using the keys:
Last night, Costolo reiterated his view that the U.S. should be stepping up security activity at the network level, saying:
The threat to Twitter came on a dark night in December 2013, when hackers accessed tweets using browser plugins that provided a backdoor into the accounts of 400,000 accounts. Millions of users had their account passwords reset, and, at the time, Twitter offered users $1 to reset their password by email.
In a post today on the company blog, Costolo said that his company was “later shocked by the scope of attack; the scope of the intrusion was much broader than what we had originally thought.”
He also noted that while it’s possible that there were “breaches of this [year] that damaged [the company’s] website and user accounts,” the company did have additional safeguards in place against attacks in the future:
He went on, “We now take our own actions against this type of incident in future, to make sure that we are better prepared to handle the type of attack that was found in this data.”
“We have additional, unique tools, like our @response team, and they’ve implemented a patch that should keep users safe for a bit longer. These things can easily be overlooked in the world of security,” he added.
Though Twitter had previously

What it does show is how companies are continuing to put themselves at the centre of what they do, and have been for some time. What they do now may well change in the future, though.

"It has become just a very serious issue in Germany and that’s something the German authorities have found acceptable given the heightened security concerns and demands being made by the U.S. and the West for “erasing content” from sites suspected of hosting leaked financial data. Germany has now stepped up action by banning accounts belonging to the U.S. and China, and adding a ban on the use of Google or any search engine for German-held funds. The country may have also technically closed the loophole in the leaked cache, but it has not yet, as it is still investigating this issue as part of the so-called “U.S. Economic Signal.”
The ban appears to be the first major move by German authorities against the service. Last year, it issued a general ban on the use of the Google.de website for financial gain, but this ban was overturned by Germany’s top administrative body, the Schabeskabarteskabe de Finanz AG, after it met with Google yesterday to discuss the request. German financial services firm Siam Germany also issued a statement today, in response to the new ban.
Google is being ordered to delete any financial records pertaining to German resident of a company overseas (including a German company in Germany) from its offices in Germany.
The directive was ordered by the Schabeskabe in a complaint alleging that the company was running a practice of making company books “deliberate in a highly irregular manner and with no prospect of being able to meet any of the obligations attendant to these books,” and had in the course of trying to destroy company accounts but could not or refused to comply with any of the creditors’ demands. German tax authorities are also investigating Google’s dealings with a company in Germany.
According to German newspaper Der Spiegel, the Schabeskabe also asked for proof that documents relating to German-held company accounts held in foreign countries could not be retrieved in Germany using Google searches — by asking Google and any search engine to give them. The document also can no longer be accessed by German residents of the German Republic of Germany.
There’s no suggestion at this point that any Google-based German resident in Germany (as a person or company) can download in Germany a file from Google’s servers. And the Schabes report also states Google was still neither liable nor liable for any financial breach that may have led to employees making out personal accounts with the service in a way in violation of German law.
Google’s German ban follows changes by the Schabes in an administrative order issued in Bavaria back in January. At that time it ordered Google to delete German-held company accounts and to send confidential company data to Switzerland and other German-held companies. The company was ordered to give up a percentage of its workforce for the period in Bavar because of their legality. The Schabes report was a follow-up to this back in January.
Since then, Google has been embroiled in a series of stockpulsing and privacy policy investigations in Germany.
Earlier this year Germany’s Hamburg Magistrate Agency warned the company’s data-sharing activities may violate German and EU law. Since then, Google has had other rtbf orders reviewed by Schleswig-Holstein DPA."
"After a short but major strategic partnership, Bump, the world’s largest mobile concierge app, is expanding its services in Australia and New Zealand. After launching in Australia, Bump.com will enter new markets. In addition, the company has opened up an office in London. The London office will help Bump expand to Britain as it looks to sign up other countries. It’s currently live in the United States.
Bump.com, which competes with Uber and other transportation apps in the U.S., is available in more than 75 cities in the U.S. and Canada. It claims it will have 7 million drivers on the platform and handles 2 million taxi calls each day. The app charges a flat $20 flat fare (although that could be increased to $30 on request). In the UK Bump competes against Hailo at least.
When a carpooling network like Uber and a car ride service are included in the car ride platform in other countries, it has another revenue stream. This is called shared economy fares,

 a deeper feature set: it doesn’t even matter what words you use in a chat room. That is entirely new to iOS 7, and really marks the new look of Apple, as the company continues to refix to existing features that have distinct areas for design inspiration and the ability to work within a larger, more responsive design.
As for performance, some of these changes have been rolled out over the last few days; you’ll notice they already in the latest software update, but the iOS 7.2 update feels like over-the-air, which is the usual issue with iOS 7.2. Still, the beta brings a number of interesting tweaks for the next major update, and it makes the latest 7.2 update a great one."
"When it comes to finding cute animal people in real life, the results can be disappointing. Sure, Finding Finding Pikachu in the wild can be enjoyable, but is it really the same as finding a wild new species of smartphone?
This new feature is a direct reaction to Animal Planet‘s new feature, in which users can search for the animals featured in their next photo. This is not only a great new feature for the app, but also something that can be useful in other areas of the mobile entertainment chain.

The new feature goes live today on the new version of Animal Planet and is now available to iOS 7.2 users. Similar to how a new version of Finding Friends was also rolled out yesterday, Animal Planet supports a “friends” feature to share photos from the app with individual friends, as well as a new “co-browsing” feature, which lets you look for friends who are also using the app. The app also has a few other tweaks, too, including the ability to see the age difference of a match, and to finally create a list of a few animal friends you don’t just happen to love.

Animal Planet is a fun game for anyone who wants to browse the featured animals on the Animal Planet app, including the new, animated ones. The apps are pretty simple, too – you don’t see a lot of animation, and it seems as though the focus is on gameplay, but it’s interesting to see this sort of application take off as a new type of social dating application, too. Finding cute creatures from such an obvious source is definitely a lot more engaging than spending a day watching cute animals on the internet on your desktop screen.
Animal Planet is free to download and play, which makes it more similar to finding friends in the real world than it is to finding just the right someone to play with. The app is a free download here on Apple’s App Store. Go ahead, if you’re not interested in animal finding."
"We all get bombarded with our daily dose of information coming from everywhere and every point of view, both logical and not always relevant. Some of this is unavoidable, as it seems that with every passing moment that we have — some have it come for my attention and some seem to be coming from the heart.
When a startup is founded, or when a business is formed, or when a technology company is formed — the most recent example being Twitter — and all forms of communication that you have both. What really matters is that you have a window into that window and then, the key to building it has been the same one-to-one relationship, the one you had with someone who’d thought about you years ago.
And when it comes to the Internet, what matters is the user experience, as it’s something you’ll never forget or remember, and, the ability to remember the experiences you had using it, as it was when you first got a taste of the Internet.
I think that you mentioned a startup before who probably has a list of apps with similar functionality to some of their existing apps, but it’s important to recognize that there are tons out there that will do very different things and put things on a pedestal. I’ll give you an illustration that is pretty basic for how this works. This past week at TechCrunch Disrupt SF we had a mobile app called Fliptopia, which does something similar to Fliptopia but goes farther as it learns more about you and your behavior.
One difference between Fliptopia and the other apps mentioned before, Fliptopia’s focus is more on the “lifestyle” content, i.e. your activity within the app. Fliptopia takes your heart rate and then matches it with a bunch of other metrics that indicate different behaviors and responses. Users also get a weekly score based on things like time spent in the app compared to the average app.
Fliptopia looks pretty similar to something like Waze, except that you actually get to see the activity of the other people around you. But you keep coming back every day and you

 up the third. In other words, these are the companies that have the most potential to make a killing in the mobile era. And I suspect you will notice at least a few of their names have been thrown around the local scene, too (e.g, “Vidade,” “Vidacosta,” etc.).
It also seems that there is some consolidation among the smaller players in this industry (ahem, the Oric University of Paris, and others).
The other big news is at first, Nokia is selling a stake to China’s Xiaomi, which seems to be a nice surprise, since it covers a variety of devices, but the most interesting thing that happens is the acquisition of Navteq, the company formerly known as Navteq. I understand that Navteq’s new owners will see Navteq as an Asset to purchase for use in various parts of the company’s technology and technology platform, and that this is another big step for Nokia’s cross-selling business.
The acquisition seems likely to close down any other major asset that Nokia had in the business of manufacturing its own smartphones (although it’s been rumoured to be mulling a Windows Phone 8.1 smartphone with a 6-inch screen).
As Microsoft-owned Nokia gears up for another big sale of Nokia’s hardware assets (as Microsoft did to sell its Here mapping patents to Apple for some of its own money) it’s probably not too much of a shock that it would sell its hardware-making business to the highest bidder. Given that it’s not exactly a white-label product, it is very hard to imagine what kind of money it would generate.
We’ve reached out to Nokia for comment on the news.
Update: A Nokia spokesperson says, “Nokia does not comment on rumor or speculation of a future sale of its assets.”"
"Samsung’s latest flagship is an ultra high-resolution smartphone that was spotted just hours after the new flagship model was announced at a special press event. The new Galaxy Note 7 smartphone is said to be able to display a 7 inch display, though it is smaller than its predecessor, and it will reportedly come with “full HD” video playback and a high degree of noise.
Samsung won’t be jumping on the tablet bandwagon entirely. That’s because the Galaxy Note 7’s 7-inch screen is slightly larger than the Galaxy S7, and its display is said to be “screens as bright as Full HD” according to the Times of India.
Samsung will use this latest Galaxy Note to mark down its larger devices, but it’s not surprising this launch marks a nice step up for the Korean OEM. The Korean firm will likely continue to release other flagships in a similar vein — although it seems likely this is another case of a larger device to make sure there’s room for both a large device that can still handle big data download demands, and the small one that can still handle video requests well.
It’s no secret that many people use their smartphone primarily to look more and more at the larger, less expensive devices at a given moment, and the Galaxy Note 7 looks like that bigger phone is a big leap forward for Samsung in terms of offering something different or interesting. Could we see big-screen TVs like they appear on our next Samsung Galaxy Note  or Note 8? Maybe.
It’s also been a rumored rumor we’ve heard for a while that Samsung is making another kind of phablet, with a more traditional flagship like the Galaxy Note 10-inch (perhaps the Note 7?). The idea that it would be more of a ‘flagship’ device, to the Galaxy Note, could be a hint towards that as well, as the larger hardware would make sense for the large screen.
Samsung president Kunimasa Sinseun has discussed the company’s two upcoming flagship smartphones in the past several weeks, including the Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy Note 6, both of which are reportedly going to be unveiled within this year’s Mobile World Congress event this month in Barcelona. That event is taking place in Barcelona, so we could see if Samsung follows the same pattern we saw the Note 7 and Note 8 as previous flagship smartphones."
"Samsung today unveiled its newest flagship device: the Galaxy S7 Edge, an ultra slim, curved phone with curved edges that you can bend like a real on-screen display. The company has been rightly aggressive in naming this new flagship, and it’s hard to deny other OEMs are going to follow suit, but this device looks like it might have something in common with its predecessor.
As usual, these smartphones look very similar in terms of physical specs, but Samsung has gone with a curved edge — one of these components is
